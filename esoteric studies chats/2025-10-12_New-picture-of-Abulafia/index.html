Jewish mysticism was Abraham Abulafia, the self-proclaimed prophet with <br>
messianic pretenses who was active in the second half of the thirteenth <br>
century, the precise moment in medieval Jewish history that witnessed an <br>
impressive proliferation of mystical activity in several geographical settings <br>
both within the land of Israel and the Diaspora communities, especially on <br>
the European continent. In contrast to most other kabbalists from this <br>
period, about whom we know more of their literary productions than their <br>
biographies, in the case of Abulafia, we have a relative wealth of <br>
information concerning his personal life, largely due to the meticulous <br>
fashion that he demonstrated in his compositions. There is an intricate <br>
connection between Abulafia’s writings and his peregrinations in the world. <br>
Although it is probably wise to exercise a measure of doubt regarding the <br>
veracity of some of Abulafia’s claims, given his fanciful imagination, there <br>
is much of historical validity that we can glean from his works.</p><p>As the information we have about his personal life attests, Abulafia was <br>
a man of contradictions, an impression that is corroborated by the style of <br>
thinking and argumentation employed in his voluminous corpus. Although <br>
he seems to have been a dedicated and charismatic teacher who sought the <br>
company of others and desired to have an impact in the socio-political arena <br>
(attested most emphatically by his defiant attempt to see Pope Nicholas in <br>
in 1280), he also advocated a path of meditation based on solitude and <br>
withdrawal. His biography suggests that he was an unusually restless man, <br>
yet the goal of his teaching was the attainment of a state of equanimity and <br>
detachment. Abulafia’s kabbalah provides the means for one to attain the <br>
spiritual state of the world-to-come, which for him is the untying of the <br>
knots that chain the rational soul to the body. The pursuits of the physical <br>
world are obstacles on the path towards mystical enlightenment that need to <br>
be removed by an ascetic discipline before one engages in the meditational <br>
practice that leads to the union with the divine. Nevertheless, Abulafia does <br>
not preach the absolute nullification of the body. He recognizes not only <br>
that the psychological well-being of the individual depends upon the</p><p>2 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>reintegration into the physical world, but that the mystical union itself is <br>
experienced in somatic, even erotic, terms.</p><p>The equally puzzling and contradictory nature of his intellectual profile <br>
is perhaps best exemplified by the synthesis he sought between the <br>
philosophical ideas of Maimonides and the doctrines of ancient Jewish <br>
esotericism, especially as they were filtered through the prism of the <br>
German Pietists. Abulafia had no reservations about accepting the ideal of <br>
conjunction with the Active Intellection the one hand, and the techniques <br>
of letter-permutation and combination of the letters of the divine names, on <br>
the other. Indeed, the latter, in his opinion, was a superior means to achieve <br>
the former than the philosophical path of cognition. Here is a man who <br>
could constantly extol the superiority of Hebrew as the natural language by <br>
means of which God created the world, and yet affirm that one could <br>
practice the letter-permutations in any language since all the languages are <br>
contained in Hebrew even though they are conventional. In response to the <br>
attack against him led by Solomon ben Abraham ibn Adret in the 1280’s, <br>
Abulafia created a typological distinction between his own form of <br>
prophetic kabbalah and the kabbalah based on a theosophic understanding <br>
of the sefirot. Yet, as I suggest in the essays included in this volume, <br>
Abulafia was deeply influenced by the language and symbolism of what is <br>
today called the theosophic kabbalah. Just as he both appropriated and <br>
rejected the philosophical orientation of Maimonides, so, too, he <br>
appropriated and rejected the theosophic perspective of the kabbalists. The <br>
ability to appropriate and reject does not bespeak an inconsistency or <br>
instability in Abulafia’s cognitive abilities. On the contrary, it indicates a <br>
mind that could assimilate complex and conflicting conceptual schemes. <br>
Where we see clashing polarities, Abulafia saw truth doubling itself in <br>
ambiguity.</p><p>The power of Abulafia’s intellect is evident in the manner that he <br>
anchors difficult theological ideas through the exegetical techniques of <br>
numerology (gematriyyah), letter-transposition (temurah), and acrostics <br>
(notariqori). Anyone who has tried to read Abulafia knows it is impossible <br>
to get through one page without a pen and pad ready at hand to decode the <br>
many mathematical and linguistic associations that he establishes in an <br>
effort to link together disparate expressions and concepts. If logical <br>
consistency is the mark of brilliance, then Abulafia may prove to be a <br>
disappointment. In order to appreciate his genius, it is necessary to adopt an <br>
approach that sees beyond polar dichotomies. Abulafia’s mind constantly</p><p>Introduction 3</p><p>pushes at the limits of reason’s reach, taking away with one hand what he <br>
has given with the other. One of the greatest indications of Abulafia’s <br>
deviation from Maimonides is his acceptance of a logic that is illogical, <br>
which is expressed in the concurrent affirmation of opposites. This <br>
coincidence is a repeated emphasis in Abulafia’s writings, but it is perhaps <br>
best captured in his notion of the inversion of opposites by means of which <br>
the contrasting qualities are identified. Thus, for Abulafia, the head is the <br>
tail, right is left, the merciful one is the judge, the angel is Satan, and so on. <br>
There is never a point of stasis in his thinking inasmuch as the thing can <br>
become its contrary. Every thought is thus a waystation on the path that will <br>
carry us further on the journey after a temporary respite.</p><p>It has been commonplace in modem scholarship to distinguish sharply <br>
between two kinds of kabbalah, the theosophic and the ecstatic. Whereas <br>
Gershom Scholem limited these types to thirteenth-century Spain, Moshe <br>
Idel has expanded the historical categories and argued that these are the two <br>
phenomenological trends in Jewish mysticism more generally. As I <br>
remarked above, Abulafia himself is the kabbalist most responsible for this <br>
typological classification. While it is helpful to use this typology in the <br>
study of Jewish mysticism, and Idel’s critique of a relatively monolithic <br>
presentation of the history of kabbalah that has ensued from a neglect of the <br>
writings of Abulafia and his disciples is certainly justified, it is also <br>
necessary to avoid a rigid reification of these divisions. The studies that <br>
have been assembled in this volume illustrate a somewhat more fluid and <br>
elastic exposition of Abulafia’s prophetic kabbalah in relation to the <br>
theosophic kabbalah of his generation. Indeed, even though Abulafia is to <br>
be credited with formulating the typological distinction, he is constantly <br>
transgressing the boundaries he set out to establish. These essays attempt to <br>
articulate this transgression of boundaries, and thus they have been written <br>
(as all writing inevitably must) from the space of rupture, the place where <br>
the word is fractured and the ray of reason is bent by the shimmer of <br>
mystical insight.</p><p>In the first essay, “Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic: Secrecy and the <br>
Disclosure of Withholding,” I argue that the hermeneutics of esotericism in <br>
Abulafia’s prophetic kabbalah is in an essential way similar to what one <br>
finds in the theosophic kabbalah. Abulafia is surely influenced by <br>
Maimoinides’ notion of secrecy. Indeed, the Maimonidean resolution to the <br>
tension between the mandate to conceal secrets, on the one hand, and the <br>
need to reveal them, on the other, was widely held by kabbalists of the</p><p>4 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>various schools in the thirteenth century. With respect to this critical issue, <br>
it would be prudent on the part of intellectual historians of this period to <br>
recognize the shared assumptions of the philosophical and mystical <br>
traditions. Maimonides was not simply a negative catalyst in the evolution <br>
of Jewish esotericism. Yet, in the end, Abulafia’s concept of language and <br>
the understanding of mystical experience based thereon necessitates that his <br>
formulation of the esoteric departs from Maimonides and is closer in <br>
orientation to the theosophic kabbalists. That is, the secret is not only a <br>
potentially problematic theological idea that must be concealed from the <br>
ignorant masses even as it is revealed to the intellectual elite; the secret is a <br>
secret because it relates to the divine name, which is the mystical essence of <br>
the Torah, and thus comprises the convergence of the hidden and the <br>
revealed. The disclosure of the secret is predicated on its concealment even <br>
from the one to whom it has been disclosed. Orality is the only valid form <br>
of transmission of this secret; in writing one can only allude to this secret in <br>
such a way that the enlightened individual will apply his own power of <br>
supposition to discern the allusions. With respect to this interplay of <br>
passive reception and creative exegesis as well there is a common element <br>
in the theosophic and the prophetic trends of kabbalah, although there were <br>
some kabbalists (Nahmanides comes to mind) who ostensibly denied the <br>
efficacy of human reason altogether as a means to comprehend the secrets <br>
of the kabbalah. In some passages, Abulafia expresses a position similar to <br>
that of Nahmanides, for in his mind the truth of the kabbalah exceeds the <br>
categories of human reason even though in the very same passages he <br>
depicts the mystical experience in terms that resonate with the <br>
philosophical ideal of conjunction.</p><p>The analysis of Abulafia’s hermeneutics and the notion of secrecy yields <br>
the conclusion that he cannot be described as exclusively conservative or <br>
innovative. He occupies a site between these two poles; indeed, the constant <br>
movement from one pole to the other suggests that for Abulafia, as for other <br>
kabbalists of his generation, there is no contradiction in the view that what <br>
is innovatively proposed is the ancient tradition that has been transmitted <br>
through the ages. Kabbalists would see no logical problem with the claim <br>
that revelation is an uncovering of the older truth. The very same kabbalist <br>
who insists on the restricted dissemination of limited secrets from master to <br>
disciple (which is often linked as well to the preference for orality over <br>
writing) expands the boundaries of the tradition by creatively explicating <br>
(through oral and written channels) secrets and reinterpreting earlier texts</p><p>Introduction 5</p><p>in a new way. Instead of positing the conservative and innovative <br>
dispositions in oppositional terms, therefore, it is necessary to look upon <br>
them as two tendencies that converge in the mind of one person. The <br>
propensity to maintain orientations that appear to be antithetical bespeaks <br>
the complex nature of the effort on the part of the human spirit in the <br>
Middle Ages to grasp the ultimate truth both in terms of what has been <br>
received and what can be innovated.</p><p>The stance I am taking with respect to the notion of tradition in mystical <br>
texts resonates with the idea of tradition more generally in the history of <br>
Judaism. As a number of scholars have noted, tradition in Judaism <br>
embraces the paradox of presenting the novel as ancient. What becomes <br>
traditional is constructed on the basis of textual expansion by way of <br>
creative hermeneutics, which in many occasions entails the misreading of <br>
previous sources. Millin hadetin &#x27;atiqin, “new ancient words,” according to <br>
the locution of the zoharic authorship (Zohar 3:166b), succinctly captures <br>
the paradox of esotericism affirmed by the kabbalists, which is predicated <br>
on the confluence of ostensible antinomies. One would be inclined to argue <br>
that if the matter is new, then it cannot be old, and if it is old, then it cannot <br>
be new. However, the kabbalists push the mind to its limit by using <br>
language that points beyond itself: What is new is new because it is old, but <br>
it is old because it is new. An appreciation of this insight is basic to <br>
undertsanding the kabbalistic approach to the transmission of secrets that <br>
by nature must be withheld, an attitude adopted by Abulafia as well.</p><p>In the second essay, “The Doctrine of Sefirot in the Prophetic Kabbalah <br>
of Abraham Abulafia,” I explore the role accorded the sefirot in Abulafia’s <br>
prophetic kabbalah. As I briefly noted above, Abulafia is to be credited with <br>
presenting the typological distinction between what is called in <br>
contemporary scholarship the theosophic and the ecstatic trends of <br>
kabbalah. This taxonomy, however, must be seen in its proper historical and <br>
literary context. When viewed in this light it is apparent that Abulafia <br>
articulated matters in this way as part of his response to the criticism <br>
directed towards him by one of the most powerful rabbinic leaders of the <br>
Spanish Jewish community, Solomon ibn Adret, who was himself a master <br>
of the kabbalistic lore. A closer examination of his writings, including the <br>
epistle he wrote to Judah Salomon in which he specifically mentions the <br>
“two types of kabbalah,” reveals that he was influenced by theosophic <br>
terms and symbols in more than just a peripheral manner. I have argued, <br>
moreover, that the term “theosophy” may even be applied to Abulafia’s</p><p>6 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>own conception of hokhmat ha- ’elohut, which denotes divine wisdom that <br>
stands in contrast to divine science as understood by Maimonides. The <br>
divine wisdom consists of the esoteric gnosis of the name, which cannot be <br>
attained by the discursive metaphysics of the philosophers. Indeed, on <br>
numerous occasions in his writings, Abulafia emphasizes that the <br>
knowledge of the name cannot be apprehended by the philosophers; it is <br>
unique to the prophets of Israel who have received and transmitted this <br>
knowledge as an oral tradition.</p><p>By suggesting that the term “theosophy” can be applied to Abulafia’s <br>
own kabbalah, I do not intend to deny the obvious distinction that he makes <br>
between the kabbalists who place primary emphasis on the sefirot as the <br>
potencies of God and those who focus on the divine names. My point is <br>
rather that, for Abulafia himself, the kabbalah embraces both the knowledge <br>
of the sefirot and the knowledge of the letters, an idea that he traces back to <br>
thirty-two paths of wisdom mentioned in Sefer Yeçirah, which consists of <br>
the ten sefirot and twenty-two letters. Both branches of the kabbalah are <br>
related to the names of God, which are contained in the one unique name, <br>
YHWH. Cleaving to the latter, which is presented in terms of the <br>
philosophical ideal of intellectual conjunction, is the ultimate focus of <br>
Abulafia’s kabbalah. Insofar as the self is unified with the Active Intellect <br>
in the experience of conjunction, and the latter comprises the ten separate <br>
intellects, which are identified as the ten sefirot of the Jewish esoteric <br>
tradition, it follows that, for Abulafia, the sefirotic entities play an <br>
instrumental role in the mystical experience of union. In that experience, <br>
the ontological distinction between self and other is erased, for the <br>
realization of the former depends on merging with the last of the separate <br>
intellects, which is identified with the first of the intellects, a confluence <br>
symbolically portrayed by the figure of Metatron, the angel who is both an <br>
elder (zaqen) and a youth (na&#x27;ar), Israel and Jacob. To the degree that the <br>
self and the intellect are unified in the moment of conjunction, it is <br>
possible, even necessary, to speak of the sefirot as internal states of <br>
consciousness. But the psychological cannot be separated from the <br>
ontological, which is to say, these internal states correspond to the external <br>
intelligences that govern the movement of the celestial spheres.</p><p>The sefirot, which Abulafia also identifies as the attributes {middot) of <br>
God, are the channels by means of which the intellectual overflow is drawn <br>
upon the mystic and thereby facilitate his cleaving to the divine name. <br>
According to Abulafia, the ideal intelligible forms of the sefirot are distinct</p><p>Introduction 7</p><p>from God, yet they are not found apart from him as they are expressive of <br>
his power. Abulafia describes the containment of the ten sefirot within the <br>
divine as a great secret. In language that he borrows from Eleazar of <br>
Worms, he links the ten sefirot to the ineffable name, decoding YHWH as <br>
yod hawwayot, the ten essences that are the separate intellects. The name is <br>
thus intrinsically connected to the sefirotic gradations. Abulafia’s <br>
psychological interpretation of the sefirot as internal states of mind is <br>
predicated on this ontological assumption.</p><p>In the third essay, “Mystical Rationalization of the Commandments in <br>
the Prophetic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia,” I argue that ritual <br>
observance was imbued with new significance in Abulafia’s writings by its <br>
being transformed into a means to occasion a mystical experience, the <br>
contours of which in great measure were shaped by philosophical concepts <br>
and modes of discourse. The reasons for the commandments have both an <br>
exoteric and an esoteric sense. The latter relates to the mysteries of the <br>
Torah, which consist of the divine names that are disclosed to the <br>
enlightened kabbalists. A similar structuring of experience is attested in <br>
theosophic kabbalah, and thus we are justified in speaking of a shared <br>
phenomenological element in these two kabbalistic trends with respect to <br>
the specific issue of the mystical valorization of ritual. The gap dividing the <br>
theosophic and the ecstatic streams of kabbalah should be narrowed insofar <br>
as in both there is a mystical spiritualization of traditional ritual. Moreover, <br>
in both streams, this spiritualization involves the experience of union (or <br>
conjunction) with the divine, an experience that was shaped by <br>
philosophical assumptions. The transfiguration of ritual into a sacrament <br>
that facilitates psychic ascent and the ontic reintegration into the divine is <br>
an experience that theosophic and ecstatic kabbalists alike considered to be <br>
on a par with prophecy. From this vantage point it is somewhat misleading <br>
to call Abulafia’s kabbalah “prophetic” in contradistinction to the other <br>
form of kabbalah. The term “prophetic” applies equally well to the <br>
theosophic kabbalah as is attested by the fact that several of the theosophic <br>
kabbalists explicitly identified themselves as prophets, a point that is made <br>
emphatically by Abulafia himself. To be sure, Abulafia would have <br>
contrasted his own understanding of prophecy from that of the theosophic <br>
kabbalists. In my judgment, this contrast is valid only up to a certain point, <br>
for there is much that is shared by the two streams of kabbalah with respect <br>
to the understanding of prophecy as the mystical conjunction of the soul</p><p>8 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>with the divine name, which is understood as the inner essence of the <br>
Torah.</p><p>There seems to me sufficient reason to call into question the designation <br>
of theosophic kabbalah as theurgic in contradistinction to the prophetic <br>
kabbalah of Abulafia. While it is certainly true that Abulafia rejects the <br>
theurgical understanding of the theosophic kabbalists, and even when he <br>
appropriates their language (as in his discussion of the mystical intent of the <br>
sacrifices) he tends to emphasize the mystical over the theurgical valence, it <br>
is nevertheless the case that he does affirm a type of theurgy related to the <br>
unification of the divine attributes. As I have already noted, Abulafia <br>
categorically rejects the theosophic understanding of the sefirot as <br>
hypostatic potencies, but he does insist that the divine unity is expressed <br>
within and through the ten sefirot, which he identifies as the ten separate <br>
intellects. His frequent warning against the danger of separating the sefirot, <br>
an act that he calls (in a manner analogous to the theosophic kabbalists) by <br>
the rabbinic idiom for heresy, “cutting the shoots,” must not be seen as <br>
mere rhetoric. On the contrary, according to Abulafia, the human intellect <br>
plays an active role in unifying God through the ten separate intellects as a <br>
consequence of the intellectual conjunction, which is presented as the <br>
paramount mystical rationale for the commandments.</p><p>Collectively, then, these studies set out to cast Abulafia in a somewhat <br>
different light. It is the hope of the author that the vision that will appear <br>
within this light will not be viewed as a seeing against previous scholarship, <br>
but a seeing beyond where we have been hithertofore, a vision that may <br>
help others see beyond my own necessarily limited perspective.</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic: <br>
Secrecy and the Disclosure of Withholding</p><p>P r e s e r v a t io n  O f T h e  Se c r e t  T h r o u g h  Its  D isc l o s u r e</p><p>Perhaps the most appropriate term to characterize the body of literature that <br>
scholars have heuristically referred to as medieval Jewish mysticism is <br>
esotericism, hokhmat ha-nistar, a gnosis (encompassing both doctrine and <br>
practice, belief and ritual) that is deemed secretive and that must therefore <br>
be transmitted only to a small circle of initiates.1 In his essay “Das <br>
Verhältnis Maimunis zur jüdischen Mystik,” published in 1936, Alexander <br>
Altmann noted that the “esoteric nature of mystical teachings in Judaism is <br>
expressed by the terms sod (‘secret’), sithrey Torah (‘mysteries of the <br>
Law’), and their equivalents. Obscure though the historical origins of <br>
Jewish mysticism are, and especially its connections with the various <br>
schools of prophecy, apocalyptic literature, and Gnosis, a definite esoteric <br>
posture, setting down a precise form of transmission, had evolved as early <br>
as the tannaitic period.”2 Altmann went so far as to suggest that the <br>
exclusive transmission of mystical knowledge from master to disciple <br>
attested already in rabbinic sources may have been due to the influence of <br>
Hellenistic mystery religions. Bracketing the historical veracity of</p><p>1 The extreme form of secrecy affirmed by Jewish mystics when compared to other <br>
religious traditions has been noted by W. Stace, Mysticism and Philosophy (London, <br>

Jewish Thought, edited by A. Jospe (Detroit, 1981), pp. 201-202.</p><p>10 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>Altmann’s surmise, it is noteworthy that he discerned that in Jewish <br>
mysticism, beginning in its early stages, the notion of secrecy is essential. <br>
Indeed, Altmann’s remarks suggest that in his opinion the mystical <br>
phenomenon must be circumscribed within the framework of esotericism, a <br>
perspective to which I readily assent when the focus is set in a more limited <br>
way upon the mystical trends of Jewish thought and practice that converged <br>
in the High Middle Ages, especially in the thirteenth and fourteenth <br>
centuries, which witnessed an intense proliferation of literary activity in <br>
various occult fraternities spread throughout the Jewish Diaspora.</p><p>Gershom Scholem, as we may surmise from certain passages in his <br>
scholarly oeuvre, distinguished sharply between mysticism and esotericism. <br>
It is evident from other passages that he also appreciated the singular <br>
importance of the notion of the secret in the kabbalistic orientation, and on <br>
occasion he was even prepared to identify esotericism and mysticism when <br>
the terms were applied specifically to the history of kabbalah. As an <br>
example of the former tendency, I note that in one publication Scholem <br>
maintained that mysticism “means a kind of knowledge which is by its very <br>
nature incommunicable,” insofar as the object of mystical experience is <br>
inexpressible id human language, whereas esotericism involves a “kind of <br>
knowledge that may be communicable and might be communicated, but <br>
whose communication is forbidden.”3 In another work, Scholem readily <br>
acknowledged that kabbalah “became to a large extent an esoteric <br>
doctrine,” but even in that context he reiterated the distinction between the <br>
mystical and the esoteric elements in the kabbalah on the epistemological <br>
basis that the former, unlike the latter, embraces a knowledge that lies <br>
beyond communication:</p><p>By its very nature, mysticism is knowledge that cannot be communicated <br>
directly but may be expressed only through symbol and metaphor. Esoteric <br>
knowledge, however, in theory can be transmitted, but those who possess it <br>
are either forbidden to pass it on or do not wish to do so. The kabbalists</p><p>3 G. Scholem, “Jewish Mysticism in the Middle Ages,” The 1964 Allan Bronfman <br>
Lecture (New York, 1964), pp. 3-4. Compare the characterization of A. Faivre, in The <br>
Encyclopedia o f Religion, edited by M. Eliade (New York, 1987), 5: 158, s.v., <br>
Esotericism: “Strictly speaking, gnosis should be distinguished from mysticism, even <br>
though they are usually found together. Mysticism, which is more ‘feminine,’ more <br>
nocturnal, voluntarily cultivates renunciation, although this does not exclude a taste for <br>
symbolism. Gnosis, more ‘masculine,’ more solar, cultivates detachment and is more <br>
attentive to structures.”</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic 11</p><p>stressed this esoteric aspect by imposing all kinds of limitations on the <br>
propagation of their teachings, either with regard to the age of the initiates, <br>
the ethical qualities required of them, or the number of students before <br>
whom these teachings could be expounded.4</p><p>Scholem’s attempt to contrast esotericism and mysticism on the grounds <br>
that the former involves a knowledge that is communicable by nature <br>
whereas the latter is characterized as knowledge that is incommunicable is <br>
questionable. The conception of secrecy operative in this distinction is <br>
more appropriate for medieval Jewish philosophical sources, epitomized by <br>
the great figure of Maimonides, than it is for the corresponding medieval <br>
kabbalistic texts. Subsequently, I shall explore in more detail the <br>
philosophical esotericism espoused by Maimonides, which doubtless <br>
exerted a major influence on the notion of secrecy operative in the <br>
prophetic kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia and his disciples.5 What is <br>
essential to repeat at this juncture is that Scholem’s depiction of esoteric <br>
knowledge is far closer in spirit to the viewpoint articulated in medieval <br>
Jewish philosophy, which is centered on the notion of a secret that <br>
potentially can be communicated but whose communication is withheld <br>
from those who do not possess the requisite intellectual and moral <br>
perfection to comprehend it.</p><p>Consider Scholem’s observation that Jewish mysticism is a “secret <br>
doctrine” in a “double sense”, for, on the one hand, “it treats of the most <br>
deeply hidden and fundamental matters of human life” and, on the other, “it <br>
is confined to a small élite of the chosen who impart the knowledge to their <br>
disciples”.6 Scholem clearly recognized that the secrets expounded by the <br>
Kabbalists involved the deepest mysteries of our existence, but one gets the <br>
impression that what is really secretive about those secrets from Scholem’s <br>
vantage point is the fact that their dissemination is restricted. Scholem is <br>
quick to note that in certain historical periods one finds an orientation in <br>
kabbalistic literature to have a manifest impact on Jewish society. Still, this <br>
impact rarely impinged upon the fact that the innermost gnosis was limited <br>
to the initiates who are always few in number. The double sense of the term <br>
collapses into a single sense, for the understanding of the “most deeply</p><p>4 G. Scholem, Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), p. 4.<br>

of the chosen who impart the knowledge to their disciples”.</p><p>The issue of secrecy as delineated in this manner resonates, moreover, <br>
with the understanding of esotericism proffered in the formative rabbinic <br>
literature, which is also invariably related to the limits imposed on publicly <br>
disseminating knowledge of certain subjects that were deemed best <br>
restricted to a limited audience.7 The very notion of “mysteries of Torah” <br>
(sitrei torah or razei torah), a highly significant albeit infrequently <br>
mentioned motif in classical rabbinic sources,8 appears to be linked to the</p><p>7 See M. N. A. Bockmuehl, Revelation and Mystery in Ancient Judaism and <br>

Maimonides of the rabbinic elitist principle of select transmission of nonmystical <br>
secrets, see Altmann, “Maimonides’ Attitude,” pp. 203-204. On the influence of both <br>

Mention should also be made of the expression sodah shel torah, the “secret of Torah,” <br>

comment on this rabbinic theme in Nathan ben Yehiel, Aruch Completum, edited by A. <br>

the secret from those who do not; the power that ensues from knowing the <br>
secret or the concomitant weakness that derives from the lack of such <br>
knowledge are thus factors in establishing social boundaries.9 One talmudic <br>
passage is particularly noteworthy: The words we-limekhaseh ‘atiq in Isa. <br>
23:18 are interpreted as a reference to one who conceals the secrets of <br>
Torah that the Ancient of Days ( ‘atiqyomin) concealed.10 * Hiding the secret, <br>
therefore, is a form of imitatio dei, a notion that is confirmed by the <br>
appellation hakham ha-razim, the one “wise in the secrets,” applied to God, <br>
which is preserved in a liturgical formula in rabbinic literature.&quot; To hide <br>
the secrets from those unworthy to receive them is a noble form of behavior <br>
that bestows upon the individual a divine quality.12 With respect to this <br>
matter, then, rabbinic and philosophic esotericism converge even if in <br>
content there is a substantial difference between the two modes of thinking: <br>
The secret potentially can be articulated, but it is not due to either the <br>
intellectual or the moral limitations of the recipients.</p><p>It is surely no small irony that Scholem’s own taxonomy of esotericism <br>
in the history of kabbalah is indebted to this rabbinic conception, which was <br>
reinscribed in the medieval philosophical literature. With all of his efforts, <br>
on the one hand, to contrast kabbalistic spirituality and rabbinic piety on the</p><p>emulation of the Sinaitic event, words of Torah in general (and not only secrets) must be <br>
given in a whisper.</p><p>9 The point is well made in S. Bok, Secrets: On the Ethics o f Concealment and <br>
Revelation (New York, 1983), pp. 5-7, 19-20, 34, 105-107, 281-282. For a recent <br>
analysis o f esotericism from the vantage point of discursive strategy, which involves the <br>
issue of social power and authority, rather than that of symbolic content, see H. Urban, <br>

standpoint.151 would argue, by contrast, that the distinctive view of secrecy <br>
that emerges from kabbalistic sources is that the inability to communicate</p><p>13 Scholem’s presentation of rabbinic material and its relationship to Jewish <br>
mysticism, in general, and to kabbalah, in particular, is a very complex issue that cannot <br>
be dealt with adequately in this footnote. Let me simply state that Scholem equivocates <br>
on this question, sometimes speaking of a very sharp contrast between the two and other <br>
times presenting a more fluid and ambivalent picture even entertaining the idea that <br>
preserved in rabbinic texts are fragments of a “theosophic aggadah” of a gnostic-mythic <br>
nature. See Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 22-23, 29-32, 35; idem, On the Kabbalah and <br>

independently emphasized the mythical component of rabbinic sources in a manner that <br>
narrows the conceptual and semiotic gap separating classical rabbinism and medieval <br>
kabbalism. For some of the pertinent references, see J. L. Rubenstein, “From Mythic <br>

15 The linkage of the rabbinic approach and that of medieval philosophy is not </p><p>uncommon in Scholem’s thinking. See, for instance, On the Kabbalah, p. 88, where <br>
Scholem argues that the tendency of the “classical Jewish tradition,“ which is traced <br>
back to the “ethical monotheism” of the Prophets, to “liquidate myth as a central <br>
spiritual power” is “accentuated by the rationalist thinking of medieval Rabbinical <br>
Judaism.”</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic 15</p><p>the secret is not due simply to the unworthiness of a particular recipient, but <br>
it is associated rather with the inherent ineffability of the truth that must be <br>
kept secret. This is not to suggest that kabbalists through the ages have not <br>
also embraced the rhetoric of rabbinic esotericism based on the <br>
presumption that secrets must be withheld from those unworthy to receive <br>
them. The hermeneutic of esotericism displayed in many kabbalistic <br>
sources does indeed consistently attest to this elitist posture, but it certainly <br>
goes beyond it as well. The concealment of the secret is dialectically related <br>
to its disclosure. Simply put, the utterance of the mystery is possible <br>
because of the inherent impossibility of its being uttered. Even for the <br>
adept, who demonstrates unequivocally that he deserves to be a recipient of <br>
the esoteric tradition, there is something of the secret that remains in the <br>
very act of transmission. The secret has an ontological referent that is <br>
separate from the phenomenal realm and thus transcends the limits of <br>
human understanding and modes of conventional discourse.16 As an <br>
illustration of the point let me mention a secret that many scholars have <br>
signaled as one of the characteristic doctrines of medieval kabbalah, the sod <br>
du-parsufin, the mystery of the androgyne in the Godhead. To receive the <br>
secret about the androgynous nature of the divine is not to solve the <br>
problem of the mystery; on the contrary, this gnosis is precisely what opens <br>
the mystery to its deeper depths, for what is it to say that the oneness of the <br>
God of Judaism is predicated on the comprehension of and experiential <br>
participation in the sacred union between the King and the Matrona, the <br>
bridegroom and the bride? From the one example we may generalize: In <br>
kabbalistic texts, apprehension of the secret does not resolve the apparent <br>
conflict between external and internal meaning, peshaf and sod, which <br>
correspond respectively to the poles of revelation and reason, but it forges</p><p>16 The idea of separateness as essential to the nature of the secret is explored rather <br>
deftly by P. Boutang, Ontologie du Secret (Paris, 1973). See also G. L. Bruns, <br>
Inventions: Writing, Textuality, and Understanding in Literary History (New Haven and <br>
London, 1982), pp. 17-43. The distinction I have made is expressed by K. W. Bolle, <br>
“Secrecy in Religion,” in Secrecy in Religions, edited by K. W. Bolle (Leiden, 1987), <br>
pp. 11-24, as the difference between actual mysteries and the social concealment of <br>
information. In my analysis, the former depicts the kabbalistic understanding of secrecy <br>
as opposed to the latter, which accounts for the philosophic approach, although I readily <br>
admit that the latter is sometimes appropriated by kabbalists as well. The typological <br>
distinction cannot be applied in an inflexible manner.</p><p>16 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>the paradoxical awareness that the external veil and the internal face are <br>
identical because they are different.17 18</p><p>When this paradox is fully comprehended, then even the distinction <br>
between speech and silence is transcended. That is, the esoteric nature of <br>
the secret is predicated on the ultimate ineffability to which the secret <br>
refers, but the ineffability itself is the measure of what is spoken. That the <br>
kabbalists bestow a positive valence on language as the medium by which <br>
the enlightened mystic can participate in the creative process (especially <br>
through scriptural exegesis) does not mean that they oppose in principle the <br>
restraint on speech that is often associated with the strict code of <br>
esotericism.&#x27;* On the contrary, it is precisely the affirmation of language as <br>
inherently symbolic that facilitates their acceptance of that which inevitably <br>
exceeds the boundary of language. The phenomenon to which I refer has <br>
been expressed by Michel de Certeau in his telling reference to the “split <br>
structure” of mystical language by which he intends that the “only way to <br>
establish a ‘symbolic’ expression is to separate two terms that are <br>
necessary, but contrary to each other.” From that perspective mystical <br>
speech is always a “manifestation of a cut,” and consequently the ineffable <br>
is “not so much an object of discourse as a marker of the status of <br>
language.”19</p><p>I am prepared, therefore, to grant Scholem’s identification of <br>
incommunicability as a distinguishing feature of the mystical phenomenon, <br>
a quality that a host of other scholars have marked as typical of mysticism,20</p><p>17 See E. R. Wolfson, “Beautiful Maiden Without Eyes: Peshat and Sod in Zoharic <br>

Spiritual Consciousness (London, 1911), pp. 79-80. For some more recent analyses of</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic 17</p><p>but I cannot accept his distinction between mysticism and esotericism as <br>
these terms apply specifically to the kabbalistio material, for in this case <br>
esotericism, too, is based on the notion of truth that can only be articulated <br>
in its utter ineffability. The secret cannot be fully disclosed because it is in <br>
the nature of the secret to express that which cannot be expressed (indeed, <br>
even my expressipn of the inexpressibility of the secret is not adequately <br>
expressed). The distinguishing characteristic that Scholem applied to <br>
mysticism applies equally well to esotericism.</p><p>As it happens, on occasion Scholem himself acknowledged this fact and <br>
thus he merged the two together into a singular entity. For instance, in the <br>
essay he wrote for a volume honoring Mircea Eliade,21 he spoke of the <br>
“Judaic esoteric teachings or secret doctrine, regardless of whether we want <br>
to call it Jewish Gnosis or Mysticism, as it is expressed in the literature of</p><p>this phenomenon, see S. T. Katz, “Mystical Speech and Mystical Meaning,” in <br>
Mysticism and Language, edited by S. T. Katz (New York and Oxford, 1992), pp. 3-41; <br>

Unsaying (Chicago and London, 1994); G. Kalamaras, Reclaiming the Tacit Dimension: <br>
Symbolic Form in the Rhetoric o f Silence (Albany, 1994).</p><p>21 It is hardly coincidental that in a collection of studies honoring Eliade Scholem <br>
decided to articulate his position in this manner, for Eliade himself placed great <br>
emphasis on the notion of secrecy in his understanding of the religious phenomenon in <br>
general. For example, see M. Eliade, Journal 11, 1957-1969, translated by F. H. <br>
Johnson, Jr. (Chicago and London, 1989), p. 268 (entry of 1 October 1965): “When <br>
something manifests itself (hierophany), at the same time something ’occults’ itself, <br>
becomes cryptic. Therein is the true dialectic of the sacred: by the mere fact of showing <br>
itself, the sacred hides itself We can never claim that we definitively understand a <br>
religious phenomenon: something -  perhaps even the essential -  will be understood by <br>
us later, or by others immediately” (author’s emphasis). On the distinction between a <br>
“cryptic” and “clear” hierophany, see M. Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, <br>
translated by R. Sheed (New York, 1958), pp. 8-9. On the paradoxical coming-together <br>
of the sacred and the profane underlying each hierophany, which entails the <br>
concealment of the former in the disclosure of the latter, see ibid., pp. 29-30. For an <br>
explication and adaptation of Eliade’s view, see W. L. Brenneman, Jr. and S. O. Yarian, <br>
in association with A. M. Olson, The Seeing Eye: Hermeneutical Phenomenology in the <br>
Study o f Religion (University Park and London, 1982), pp. 8-9, 59-60,165-166; see also <br>
B. S. Rennie, Reconstructing Eliade: Making Sense o f Religion, foreword by M. L. <br>
Ricketts (Albany, 1996), pp. 7-40. Scholem similarly embraces the dialectic of <br>
disclosure and concealment in his understanding of the religious phenomenon.</p><p>18 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>the Kabbalists.”22 With this formulation Scholem seems much closer to the <br>
mark, for in the history of classical kabbalah, as we may ascertain from the <br>
written record of teachings that may have been transmitted originally in an <br>
oral manner, the aspect of mysticism must be contextualized in the <br>
framework of secrecy, far the ultimate datum of mystical experience is the <br>
secret.23 Philologically, the words for secret, primarily the Hebrew sod and <br>
its Aramaic equivalent raza ’, are employed by kabbalists in an ontological <br>
sense to refer to the hidden aspect of God’s being that is manifest in the <br>
theosophic structure of the sefirotic emanations.24 Even the exegetical <br>
application of these terms to the esoteric sense of a scriptural passage has as <br>
its underpinning the ontological implication. That is, the inner meaning of <br>
the verse relates to the unveiling of the potencies of the divine,25 but the</p><p>22 G. Scholem, “On Sin and Punishment: Some Remarks Concerning Biblical and <br>
Rabbinical Ethics,” in Myths and Symbols: Studies in Honor o f Mircea Eliade, edited <br>
by J. M. Kitagawa and Ch. H. Long, with the collaboration of J. C. Brauer and M. G. S. <br>
Hodgson (Chicago and London, 1969), p. 163. This point has been expressed as well by <br>
Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 253: “Kabbalah is by definition an esoteric body <br>
of speculation; whether in its theosophical-theurgical explanation of the rationales for <br>
the commandments, or in the ecstatic trend dealing with techniques o f using divine <br>
names, esotericism is deeply built into this lore.”</p><p>23 The point was made by A. K. Coomaraswamy, Figures o f Speech and Figures o f  <br>
Thought (London, 1946), p. 169: “This has too often been misinterpreted to mean that <br>
something is deliberately withheld from those who ask for a sort of universal <br>
compulsory education in the mysteries, supposing that the mystery is nothing but a <br>
communicable, although hitherto uncommunicated, secret.... So far from this, it is of <br>
the essence of a mystery ... that it cannot be communicated, but only realized; all that <br>
can be communicated are its external supports or symbolic expressions.” The emphasis <br>
on the realization of the mystery, as opposed to its mere symbolic expression, is helpful <br>
for grasping the intent of the notion of the secret operative in kabbalistic thought, for the <br>
secret relates to a form of ritual enactment reminiscent of the ancient mysteries.</p><p>24 The technical theosophic connotation of the word sod is already apparent in one <br>
passage in Sefer ha-Bahir. See D. Abrams, The Book Bahir: An Edition Based on the <br>
Earliest Manuscripts (Los Angeles, 1994), § 14, p. 125. Needless to say, in the literary <br>
evolution of the medieval kabbalistic material, this usage is considerably augmented.</p><p>25 In Kabbalah, p. 4, Scholem notes that the kabbalah is characterized by two main <br>
elements: the “dual and apparently contradictory experience o f the self-concealing and <br>
self-revealing God,” which “determines the essential sphere of mysticism,” and <br>
theosophy, “which seeks to reveal the mysteries of the hidden life of God and the <br>
relationship between the divine life on the one hand and the life of man and creation on <br>
the other.” From my vantage point both parts of Scholem’s remark are problematic. <br>
Firstly, in the history of kabbalah, there is no justification to speak of the experience of</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic 19</p><p>infinite Godhead remains concealed in the very act of self-manifestation. <br>
The secret, therefore, is not merely cognitive or epistemological in nature; it <br>
is decidedly ontological insofar as it signifies an aspect of the divine that is <br>
most appropriately referred to in paradoxical terms as the disclosed <br>
concealment. Ontological, in my understanding, implies an experiential <br>
component, for access to being comes by way of intimate experience, which <br>
in the case of the medieval kabbalist involved primarily contemplative <br>
study, prayer, and fulfillment of traditional rituals. These are the major <br>
paths that lead the kabbalist to the goal of devequt, communion with the <br>
sefirotic potencies of the divine.26</p><p>The secretive nature of that which is deemed a secret is thus allied with <br>
the potential experience of that grade of being to which the secret is related. <br>
Such a conclusion is inevitable if one begins, as one must, from the premise <br>
that God and the Torah are ontologically equivalent, a principle that is often <br>
expressed as well in terms of the mystical identification of the Torah as the <br>
Tetragrammaton.27 To gain knowledge of the mystery is an act of ultimate</p><p>the self-concealing and self-revealing God as contradictory; on the contrary, the <br>
distinctive phenomenological pattern of the experience entails a paradoxical <br>
coincidence of opposites, for the very God who is revealed is the concealed God; <br>
indeed, the full force of the dialectic is that the manifestation preserves the concealment. * <br>
The recognition of this point underlies much of my previous work on the nature of <br>
mystical experience in the kabbalistic sources, including, most especially, my <br>
monographic study Through a Speculum That Shines: Vision and Imagination in <br>
Medieval Jewish Mysticism (Princeton, 1994); see also studies referred to below in n. <br>
29. Secondly, I see no justification to separate the mystical and the theosophical <br>
elements in the manner that Scholem has done. For a more extensive discussion of this <br>
aspect of Scholem’s interpretative stance, see Through a Speculum That Shines, pp. <br>
278-280.</p><p>26 See G. Scholem, The Messianic Idea in Judaism and Other Essays on Jewish <br>
Spirituality (New York, 1971), pp. 203-227; Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. <br>
35-58.</p><p>27 Regarding this foundational concept in kabbalistic thinking, see Scholem, On the <br>

visualizes the imaginai form of God, which is rendered possible on the <br>
basis of the assimilation of the soul into the divine nature through the <br>
hermeneutical penetration to the sign that is hid beneath the veil of the <br>
text.2* The sefirot are the luminous emanations that constitute the multiple <br>
faces of the singular and unique faceless Godhead, which are disclosed in <br>
the letters of the Torah contemplated by the enlightened mystic (maskit) <br>
through the imaginative faculty. From this vantage point the interpretation <br>
of the hidden secret is a revelatory moment in which the ancient word is <br>
heard and seen anew.28 29 Nothing is more important for understanding the <br>
mentality of the kabbalist than the emphasis on esotericism cast in this way. <br>
Theosophical symbols and mystical rituals together (any effort to treat them <br>
separately bespeaks a fundamental lack of understanding of the kabbalistic <br>
orientation) lend expression to this inexpressible secret that reflects the <br>
dialectical manifestation of the concealed aspect of the divine. In the final <br>
analysis, such a conception underlies Scholem’s understanding of the <br>
symbol as that which “signifies nothing and communicates nothing, but</p><p>28 On the correlation of interpretation and the notion of the secretive meaning latent <br>
in the text, see F. Kermode, The Genesis o f Secrecy: On the Interpretation o f Narrative <br>
(Cambridge, Mass, and London, 1979). I am not convinced, however, that this is the <br>
implicit sense of the rabbinic midrashic approach, as Kermode suggests (p. x). See also <br>
the reservation regarding this interpretation in D. Stem, Parables in Midrash: Narrative <br>

Scholem describes the “secret dimension of language” in the following <br>
way: “The mystic discovers in language ... something pertaining to its <br>
structure which is not adjusted to a communication of what is <br>
communicable, but rather -  and all symbolism is founded on this paradox -  <br>
to a communication of what is non-communicable, of that which exists <br>
within it for which there is no expression; and even if it could be expressed, <br>
it would in no way have any meaning, or any communicable ‘sense.’”31 The <br>
“inexpressible mystery” of the Godhead becomes visible in the phenomenal <br>
reality of creation as well as through the religious acts commanded by the <br>
Torah.32 The transparency of the symbol to which Scholem consistently <br>
refers in his work relates to the paradoxical necessity of expressing the <br>
inexpressible by means of the self-disclosure of that which is concealed.33 <br>
The display itself is an act of veiling, for the word is never sufficient to <br>
express the mystical experience except as that which cannot be expressed.34</p><p>The very notion of an esoteric tradition understood in this manner <br>
entails that one cannot truly understand, let alone communicate, the <br>
conception of a tradition that is secretive. In the specific case of kabbalistic <br>
fraternities, the esotericism cultivated by various groups of Jewish men in <br>
diverse historical periods and geographical localities has not simply <br>
involved the hiding of information from those who are outside the relevant <br>
group. I would certainly acknowledge that an important aspect of secrecy in <br>
the teaching of the kabbalists is the investiture of power to those who seek</p><p>30 Major Trends, p. 27.<br>
31 Scholem, “Name of God,” p. 61.<br>
32 Scholem, op. cit., pp. 62-63, expresses this matter by stating that creation and </p><p>revelation “are both principally and essentially auto-representations of God himself, in <br>
which, as a consequence and in accordance with the infinite nature of the divinity, <br>
certain instants of the divine are introduced, which can only be communicated in terms <br>
of symbols in the finite and determined realm of all that is created. A directly associated <br>
factor with this is the further conception that language is the essence of the universe.”</p><p>33 See, for example, Scholem, “Name of God,” p. 165: “Everything is transparent, <br>
and in this state of transparency everything takes on a symbolic character.” See D. Biale, <br>
Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Cambridge, Mass, and London, <br>
1979), pp. 90-92.</p><p>34 A similar paradox is prominent in medieval Sufism, expressed particularly by the <br>
identity of the face and the veil, the act of concealing and that of self-disclosure. See A. <br>
Schimmel, “Secrecy in Sufism,” in Secrecy in Religions, pp. 81-102; W. C. Chittick, <br>
The Self-Disclosure o f God: Principles o f Ibn al-&#x27;Arabi&#x27;s Cosmology (Albany, 1998), <br>
pp. 104-108, 120-121, 128-132.</p><p>22 Abraham Abulafia</p><p>to disseminate the secrets they possess, but the dissemination invariably <br>
occurs in such a way that the hidden nature of the secret is preserved. To <br>
state the obvious, a secret presupposes the concomitant transmission and <br>
withholding on the part of the one in possession of the secret. If I possess a <br>
secret and transmit it to no one, the secret has no relevance.35 By the same <br>
token, if I readily divulge that secret without discretion, the secrecy of that <br>
secret is rendered ineffectual. What empowers me as keeper of a secret is <br>
not only that I transmit it to some and* hot to others, but that in the very <br>
transmission I maintain the secret, holding back in the advancing forward. <br>
From that vantage point the secret is a secret only to the extent that it is <br>
concealed in its disclosure, but it may be concealed in its disclosure only if <br>
it is disclosed in its concealment.36</p><p>The secret as such cannot be transmitted, for in the act of transmission it <br>
is betrayed. To be itself the secret must be withheld; it is precisely in the <br>
holding back that the power of disclosure lies. The more one attempts to <br>
express the secret the further one is from it. Something of the secret endures <br>
even as the secret is disclosed, and thus in the most exact sense there can be <br>
no tradition of secrecy. The secret that the secret cannot be transmitted, <br>
which may be referred to as the apophatic secret, plays a part in securing <br>
hope in the expectation of a genuinely open future, a hope that indeed may <br>
lie at the core of the apocalyptic messianism that has informed both <br>
Judaism and Christianity in varying degrees.37 If, however, the secret that</p><p>35 This obvious point is made by J.-F. Lyotard, The Inhuman: Reflections on Time, <br>
translated by G. Bennington and R. Bowlby (Stanford, 1991), p. 27: “A secret would <br>
not be a ‘real’ secret if no-one knew it was a secret.” See ibid., p. 2 0 1 .1 am grateful to <br>
Guy Matalon, presently a graduate student in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic <br>
Studies, New York University, for drawing my attention to the remark of Lyotard.</p><p>36 Consider George Simmel’s notion of the triadic structure of secrecy discussed by <br>

Secrecy and Concealment: Studies in the History o f Mediterranean and Near Eastern <br>
Religions, edited by H. G. Kippenberg and G. G. Stroumsa (Leiden, 1995), pp. xiii-xiv.</p><p>37 J. D. Caputo, The Prayers and Tears o f Jacques Derrida: Religion without <br>
Religion (Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1997), pp. 101-112, has argued rather <br>
persuasively that this sense of a secret is an integral aspect of the deconstructionist <br>
belief in the future as the tout autre, which may be considered a form of secular <br>
messianic hope. E. Levinas, Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, translated by <br>
A. Lingis (Pittsburgh, 1969), p. 257, also speaks of the secret appearing without <br>
appearing, a motif that he connects to the phenomenon of profanation, which is <br>
characterized by the simultaneity of the clandestine and the exposed. The play of <br>
concealment and exposure is related, moreover, to the nature of femininity, for the</p><p>Abraham Abulafia’s Hermeneutic 23</p><p>there is no secret were to be revealed, then there would be no secret to <br>
reveal since there would be nothing to conceal. The logic of esotericism is <br>
predicated on the dialectical relation that pertains between the secret that is <br>
disclosed and the secret that is withheld. For a secret to be genuinely <br>
secretive it cannot be divulged, but if it is not divulged in any manner it is <br>
hardly a secret.</p><p>The texture of secrecy, which is exemplified in this interweaving pattern <br>
of revelation and concealment, is poetically captured in the words attributed <br>
to Simeon ben Yohai in the preamble to the great assembly, ’Idra’ Rabba’, <br>
the part of the zoharic corpus that sets a dramatic stage for the disclosure of <br>
the most perplexing mysteries about the Godhead, which have been <br>
understood by both traditional and contemporary scholars as having an <br>
implicit messianic dimension.31 <em> </em> <em> </em> <em> </em> * After the members of the fraternity are <br>
adorned in their proper attire and have entered the place to thresh out the <br>
mysteries to be revealed by R. Simeon, the master sits down, weeps, and <br>
utters the words, “Woe if I reveal, and woe if I do not reveal.”39 <br>

    <p>Elliot R. Wolfson’s <em>Abraham Abulafia: Kabbalist and Prophet</em> presents a distinctly new picture of Abulafia—one that overturns older stereotypes of him as a purely “ecstatic” or “philosophical” mystic and re-embeds him in the full complexity of thirteenth-century Kabbalah.  Wolfson’s reinterpretation unfolds on several levels:</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>1. A dialectical and paradoxical thinker rather than an “ecstatic rationalist”</strong></h3></p><p>Wolfson portrays Abulafia as <em>a mind that thrives on contradiction</em>—simultaneously rational and antirational, philosophical and mystical.  Instead of reading his inconsistencies as confusion, Wolfson treats them as deliberate:  <br>
<blockquote>“Where we see clashing polarities, Abulafia saw truth doubling itself in ambiguity … the head is the tail, right is left, the merciful one is the judge”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L2-L3】.  </blockquote></p><p>Abulafia’s mystical logic <em>inverts opposites</em>; his intellect “anchors difficult theological ideas through numerology, letter-transposition, and acrostics.”  This picture diverges sharply from Gershom Scholem’s rational-vs-ecstatic dichotomy.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>2. Integration of philosophy, theosophy, and prophetic experience</strong></h3></p><p>Wolfson argues that Abulafia’s “prophetic Kabbalah” both <em>appropriates and rejects</em> Maimonidean philosophy and theosophic Kabbalah.  The book stresses his ability to <em>synthesize</em> incompatible systems:  <br>
<blockquote>“He had no reservations about accepting the ideal of conjunction with the Active Intellect … and yet he affirmed the letter-permutations as a superior means to achieve it.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L2-L3】</blockquote></p><p>Thus Abulafia becomes a <em>bridge figure</em> who fuses rational speculation, linguistic mysticism, and ecstatic experience rather than a rebel against either camp.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>3. A hermeneutic of secrecy and disclosure</strong></h3></p><p>In Wolfson’s first essay, secrecy is not merely social restriction but <em>ontological paradox</em>:  <br>
<blockquote>“The secret is a secret because it relates to the divine name … the disclosure of the secret is predicated on its concealment even from the one to whom it has been disclosed.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L4-L5】</blockquote></p><p>Abulafia’s esotericism, therefore, differs from Maimonides’ pedagogical secrecy and aligns with the <em>theosophic kabbalists’</em> sense of divine concealment-through-revelation.  This reframes Abulafia’s hermeneutics as a <em>mystical philosophy of language</em>, where revelation and withholding coincide.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>4. Re-evaluation of his relation to the sefirot</strong></h3></p><p>Wolfson disputes the rigid separation of “ecstatic” from “theosophic” Kabbalah.  He shows that Abulafia uses sefirotic symbolism extensively and interprets the sefirot as <em>states of consciousness corresponding to cosmic intellects</em>:  <br>
<blockquote>“The sefirot … are the channels by means of which the intellectual overflow is drawn upon the mystic.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L6-L7】</blockquote></p><p>Abulafia’s “divine wisdom” (<em>hokhmat ha-elohut</em>) thus deserves to be called <em>theosophy</em> as much as prophecy.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>5. Mystical rationalization and inner theurgy</strong></h3></p><p>In the third essay, Wolfson shows that Abulafia spiritualizes ritual: the commandments become <em>techniques of unification</em> rather than mechanical observances.  Even while rejecting external theurgy, Abulafia proposes an <em>intellectual-psychological theurgy</em>:  <br>
<blockquote>“The human intellect plays an active role in unifying God through the ten separate intellects as a consequence of the intellectual conjunction.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L8-L8】</blockquote></p><p>Hence, his “prophetic” Kabbalah is still profoundly <em>theurgic</em>, though internalized.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>6. Tradition as creative paradox</strong></h3></p><p>Wolfson’s Abulafia exemplifies the Jewish paradox of <em>“new ancient words”</em>—innovation presented as recovered revelation:  <br>
<blockquote>“What is new is new because it is old, but it is old because it is new.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L5-L5】</blockquote></p><p>Abulafia thus stands between conservatism and innovation, embodying tradition as continual reinterpretation.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>In sum</strong></h3></p><p>Wolfson’s <em>new picture</em> transforms Abulafia from a marginal ecstatic into a central <em>hermeneutical mystic</em> whose practice of letter-meditation is a theology of language, embodiment, and paradox.  He becomes:</p><p><ul><li><strong>Philosophically rigorous yet visionary</strong>, not anti-intellectual;  </li><br>
<li><strong>Deeply indebted to theosophic imagery</strong> rather than opposed to it;  </li><br>
<li><strong>A theorist of secrecy, language, and embodiment</strong>, anticipating later phenomenological and deconstructive insights;  </li><br>
<li><strong>A figure of creative synthesis</strong>, uniting prophecy, philosophy, and Kabbalah.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Wolfson’s closing wish encapsulates the novelty of this portrayal:  <br>
<blockquote>“The vision that will appear within this light will not be viewed as a seeing <em>against</em> previous scholarship, but a seeing <em>beyond</em> where we have been hithertofore.”【7†Abraham Abulafia†L8-L8】</blockquote></p>
