Similar in ways to Jewish Kabbalah, lettrism was\na cosmologically-oriented discourse on the powers of the Arabic alphabet and\nthe names of God that, in certain iterations, was linked to occult practices such\nas divination and the making of talismans. Some writers on lettrism, such as alBu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s famous Andalusian contemporary Muh.y\u0131\u0304 al-D\u0131\u0304n Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304 (d. 638/\n1240), confined their written discussions to theological and philosophical\naspects of the science, eschewing revelations of its occult-practical side as prone\nto dangerous misunderstandings.2 Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t, on the other hand,\nincludes no small amount of practical instruction in such matters, including\nmuch that could be described as \u201castrological magic,\u201d which is to say the use\nof talismans and prayers to harness the forces emanating from the planets and\nstars that were thought by many to shape life on earth in manifold ways.\nIndeed, some of its contents bear similarities to those of an earlier Arabic work\nof that nature, the Gha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m (Goal of the Wise) of Maslamah b. Qa\u0304sim alQurt.ub\u0131\u0304 (d. 353/964), known in its influential Latin and Spanish translations as\nPicatrix.3 Unlike that work, however, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s text is pervaded by expressions\nof distinctly Sufi piety, as is the rest of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s oeuvre, most of which does not\naddress explicitly occult-scientific matters.4\nBecause Islam and the occult sciences are sometimes perceived as fundamentally incompatible, modern scholarship has largely dismissed al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 as a\nTransmission, and Reception of the Major Works of Ah.mad Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304,\u201d Journal of\nArabic and Islamic Studies 12 (2012): 89\u201392.\n2. For Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s statement against writing about occult lettrist practices see\nhis Kita\u0304b al-M\u0131\u0304m wa-al-wa\u0304w wa-al-nu\u0304n; the edition and French translation of CharlesAndre Gilis is problematic but relatively available, Le Livre du mim, du waw, et du nun\n(Beirut: Editions Albouraq, 2002), 56\u201359.

On al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s bibliography see note 14 infra.\n\nPages 3:\nGardiner \u0002 Stars and Saints\nmere magician in Sufi garb, someone who superficially \u201cIslamized\u201d popular\noccult practices to make them more culturally palatable.5 While the present\nauthor has neither the inclination nor qualifications to offer an opinion on\nthe strictly theological question of whether al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s teachings are compatible with Islam, in what follows it is argued that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s engagement with\nastrology in Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t represents something altogether more complex\u2014\nand more interesting from an intellectual-historical perspective\u2014than popular occultism in pious drag. It is demonstrated that important elements of\nal-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s teachings in Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t, particularly his unusual doctrine of\nforty-eight letters, amounts to an esotericist unveiling of the hidden realities\nunderlying \u201cprofane\u201d astrology, one that identifies the world-shaping efflux\nof forces from the celestial spheres with the continuous flow of the letters of\nGod\u2019s creative speech. He furthermore implies a central role for Sufi adepts\n(muh.aqqiqu\u0304n) and saints (awliya\u0304\u0002) in mediating these astral-lettristic radiations,\nadding a uniquely occult-scientific twist to views deeply embedded in Sufi\ntradition\u2014and premodern Muslim culture generally\u2014of the saints as key\nexecutors of God\u2019s word and will on earth. In the conclusion, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\napproach to astrology is discussed as part of a transconfessional wave of esotericism in the late medieval Mediterranean, one that heralded shifting ideas\nabout the order of nature and the relationship between divine and human\nagency.\nAH\n. M A D Al - B U\u0304N I\u0304\nWe have only a few glimpses of the life of Abu\u0304 al-\u0003Abba\u0304s Ah.mad b. \u0003Al\u0131\u0304 b.\nYu\u0304suf al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304. The name al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 suggests that he was from the Ifr\u0131\u0304qiyan6\nport-city of Bu\u0304nah (formerly Hippo Regius, the bishopric of Augustine, now\nthe Algerian city of Annaba), in a period when Ifr\u0131\u0304qiyah was closely linked\nto Andalusia through sea-routes and the rule of the Almohad Caliphate. His\nfather is said to have been a Qur\u0002a\u0304n-reciter,7 and al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 was likely educated\nin the religious sciences from an early age. At some point al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 became a\n5. For example Manfred Ullmann, Die Natur- und Geheimwissenschaften im Islam\n(Leiden: Brill, 1972), 390\u201391; A.

In medieval Arabic geographical terms, Ifr\u0131\u0304qiya was more or less coterminous\nwith the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis, which is to say the coastal region\nof North Africa roughly between modern northwest Libya and northeast Algeria.\n7. In a number of medieval manuscript copies of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s works his father\u2019s name\nis given as Abu\u0304 al-H\n. asan \u0003Al\u0131\u0304 the Qur\u0002a\u0304n reciter (al-muqri\u0002); see, for example, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304,\nShams al-ma\u0003a\u0304rif wa-lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-\u0003awa\u0304rif, Bibliothe\u0300que nationale de France MS arabe 2649,\nfol. 2a.\n41\n\nPages 4:\n42\nMagic, Ritual, and Witchcraft \u0002 Spring 2017\ndisciple of an important Sufi shaykh in the city of Tunis, \u0003Abd al-\u0003Az\u0131\u0304z alMahdaw\u0131\u0304 (d. 621/1224)8; this is mentioned in al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s major work on the\nnames of God, \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304 wa-asra\u0304r al-ihtida\u0304\u0002 f\u0131\u0304 sharh. asma\u0304\u0002 Alla\u0304h al-h.usna\u0304\n(The Banner of Right Guidance and the Mysteries of the Proper Way in Elucidating\nthe Beautiful Names of God).9 This datum is especially noteworthy insofar as\nal-Mahdaw\u0131\u0304 also instructed the aforementioned Andalusian mystic Muh.y\u0131\u0304 alD\u0131\u0304n Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304, another of the most important Sufi writers on lettrism and\nindeed one of the most influential thinkers in the history of Islam. There is\nno definitive indication that Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304 and al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 met or were familiar\nwith each other\u2019s teachings,10 and it is unclear if al-Mahdaw\u0131\u0304 was the main\nsource of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 and Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s lettrism, as few details of al-Mahdaw\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nteachings survive. There is significant conceptual and terminological crossover between his two students\u2019 discussions of the topic, such that Ibn al\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s plentiful writings can sometimes be used to shed light on al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nmore gnomic statements, though there are also considerable differences.11\nAt some point after his time in Tunis, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 migrated eastward to Egypt,\nalso visiting Mecca at least once, in 621/1224.12 Various pieces of manuscript\nevidence place him back in Cairo in late 621/1224 and 622/1225, completing and promulgating both Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t and the aforementioned \u0003Alam alhuda\u0304 to a select audience of disciples gathered in the Qara\u0304fah cemetery\u2014\n8. On al-Mahdaw\u0131\u0304 see Ah.mad b. H\n. usayn Ibn Qunfudh, Uns al-faq\u0131\u0304r wa-\u0003izz alh.aq\u0131\u0304r, ed. Abu\u0304 Sahl Naja\u0304h. \u0003Awad.

In my 2012 article \u201cForbidden Knowledge?,\u201d I followed Brockelmann and\nothers in referring to this work as \u0003Ilm al-huda\u0304 rather than \u0003Alam, a reading I now\nbelieve to be incorrect. I first saw the title rendered as \u0003Alam in John Martin, \u201cTheurgy in the Medieval Islamic World: Conceptions of Cosmology in Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s Doctrine of the Divine Names\u201d (MA thesis, The American University in Cairo, 2011). It\nwas only after this that I noticed the title is indeed vocalized that way in some of the\noldest Bunian manuscripts, and thus was convinced of the correctness of that reading.\n10.

Scores of works attributed to al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 are extant in hundreds of manuscripts,\nand questions of which works are authentic to him are complex due to pseudepigraphy and other issues.

This enduring influence\nwas despite the efforts of some prominent theologians, such as Ibn Taym\u0131\u0304yah\n(d. 728/1328) and Ibn Khaldu\u0304n (d. 808/1406), to brand him posthumously\nas a sorcerer and heretic.18\nModern scholarship mostly has relegated al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 to the ill-defined sphere\nof \u201cpopular religion,\u201d19 thereby denying his importance to Islamic intellectual\nhistory. This was due in part to scholarly reliance on a pseudo-Bunian work\ncalled Shams al-ma\u0003a\u0304rif al-kubra\u0304\u2014a large occult-scientific miscellany of early\nmodern vintage that combines al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s writings with those of other authors,\nwhich commonly has been found in print editions since the early twentieth\ncentury.20 Close study of surviving manuscripts from the medieval period,\nhowever, reveals al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s readership in Egypt and environs to have been\ncomprised largely of learned elites.21 As the present author argues elsewhere,\nthe earliest manuscript evidence, considered alongside certain statements in\nal-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s texts, suggests that he intended his works only for Sufi adepts who\ncould properly comprehend and teach their contents, and that for a century\nor so after his death his texts indeed circulated primarily among small reading\ncommunities of esotericist Sufis who guarded their contents against exposure\nto those outside their circles.22 Over time, however, and contrary to al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nexplicit esotericism, his works (along with a number of pseudepigraphic\nworks in his name) eventually came to circulate more widely, reaching even\nMuh.ammad b. al-Zayya\u0304t, Kita\u0304b Kawa\u0304kib al-sayya\u0304rah f\u0131\u0304 tart\u0131\u0304b al-ziya\u0304rah (Cairo: Maktabah al-Azhar\u0131\u0304yah li-al-Tura\u0304th, 2005), 268.

Occultism\nthus should not be taken as synonymous with esotericism, although, as both\ntraffic in the hidden, the two cannot always be cleanly distinguished. Esotericism was integral to some occult-scientific discourses, for example the Jabirian alchemical corpus that probably was produced by Shi\u0003i collectives of the\nthird/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries,26 key teachings of which are intentionally \u201cdispersed\u201d across multiple works so as to make them inaccessible to\nall but the most committed readers.27 Esotericism was far less integral, however, to astrology, which had numerous practical applications ranging from\ndivination to medicine and agriculture, and was widely and openly engaged\nVersluis, \u201cWhat Is Esoteric?

These\ninclude Adam, the Prophet\u2019s cousin and son-in-law Al\u0131\u0304 b.

The circulation in the Islamic West of the Epistles of the Brethren of\nPurity (Rasa\u0304\u0002il Ikhwa\u0304n al-s.afa\u0304\u0002), an encyclopedic set of philosophical treatises\nproduced by a quasi-Isma\u0003ili esotericist collective in tenth-century Iraq\nundoubtedly played a role in this process as well. Over the course of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, the strain of lettrism that developed among\nwestern Sufis would come to emphasize the role of the names of God\u2014and\nthe letters of which they are composed\u2014in the creation and ongoing sustenance of the cosmos, and to position lettrism as a secret \u201cscience of the saints\u201d\n(\u0003ilm al-awliya\u0304\u0002) through which God\u2019s elite servants divined and helped guide\nthe order of the world.31\nConnections between esotericist scriptural hermeneutics and cosmological\nspeculation run deep in Islamic thought, as reflected in the Orientalist and\nphilosopher Henry Corbin\u2019s compelling axiom that an esotericist approach\nto scripture necessarily \u201cpresupposes the superimposition of worlds and interworlds, as the correlative basis for a plurality of meanings in the same text.\u201d32\nLettrism might be said to carry that logic to its utmost conclusion, its central\nconceit being that the cosmos, with its many visible and invisible parts, and\nthe Qur\u0002a\u0304n, with all its apparent and hidden meanings, are coextensive manifestations of God\u2019s creative speech. This led lettrist thinkers to assert that\nplumbing the depths of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n could facilitate the acquisition of extraordinary knowledge and power over the created world. It also led to the startling supposition that the letters of the Arabic alphabet which constitute the\nQur\u0002a\u0304n are also the very prima materia of the creation, the \u201cprimordial building-blocks\u201d of the manifest world.33\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 was a full-throated participant in this discourse, such that much\nof Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t is dedicated to the framing of a quasi-Neoplatonic,34 emanationist cosmology in which the letters of the Arabic alphabet and the divine\nAndalus: Ibn Masarra, Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304 and Isma\u0304\u0003\u0131\u0304l\u0131\u0304 Tradition (Leiden: Brill, 2014); and the\nfirst volume of Coulon\u2019s \u201cLa magie islamique.\u201d\n31.

It is the equivalent to the Intellect\nof Neoplatonic philosophy, and on the microcosmic scale it is Adam\u2019s intellect (\u0003aql), into which the letters are \u201csown\u201d (gharasa), as they will be into\neach subsequent stage of Adam\u2019s being. Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 refers to this plane as the\n\u201cfirst world of invention\u201d (\u0003a\u0304lam al-ikhtira\u0304\u0003 al-awwal), and he further identifies\nit with the divine Throne (\u0003arsh) and other symbols drawn from Muslim\nscriptures,35 and with the outermost celestial sphere (Primum Mobile). Next is\nthe \u201csecond world of invention\u201d (\u0003a\u0304lam al-ikhtira\u0304\u0003 al-tha\u0304n\u0131\u0304), which is linked to\nAdam\u2019s immortal spirit (ru\u0304h.), the divine Pen (qalam) mentioned in the\nQur\u0002a\u0304n,36 the spirit of holiness (ru\u0304h. al-qudus),37 and the rays of metaphysical\nlight that are understood to be the \u201cpre-existent\u201d essences of the saints and\nprophets.38 The third emanation is the \u201cfirst world of origination\u201d (\u0003a\u0304lam alibda\u0304\u0003 al-awwal), which is linked to the divine Footstool (kurs\u0131\u0304) of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n.39\nIt is equivalent to the World Soul of Neoplatonism and is mirrored by Adam\u2019s\nsoul or psyche (nafs). A mesocosmic or intermediary realm of images that\nlend form to material things potentiated by the divine word, it is a plane in\nwhich the letters of the alphabet exist as angelic forces working continually\nto constitute the manifest world, which makes up in the fourth and final\nplane. The fourth plane is the \u201csecond world of origination\u201d (\u0003a\u0304lam al-ibda\u0304\u0003\nal-tha\u0304n\u0131\u0304), which corresponds to the heart (qalb) and bodily nature (fit.rah) of\nwas reading Plotinus, Porphyry, et al., or indeed that he considered himself a \u201cphilosopher\u201d in any strict sense. Rather it seems that he was developing a tradition of\nthought in which Neoplatonism had long since been naturalized.\n35. On the divine Throne, see Q 17:44, 40:15, 43:82, 81:20; also Cl.

This fusion of cosmological concepts was already found in the Epistles of the Brethren of Purity some\nthree centuries prior to al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304. It allowed the Brethren to mount a defense\nof astrology vis-a-vis Islamic teachings, by portraying the influences of the\nheavens as the means through which God\u2019s \u201ccommand\u201d (amr) or \u201cword\u201d\n40.

Josef van Ess notes that ideas of astrological causation were present among\npre-Islamic Arabs, and astrology certainly had prominent proponents in the first few\ncenturies of Islamic thought, among the most notable of which were Abu Ya\u0003qu\u0304b alKind\u0131\u0304 (died mid-third/ninth century) and the aforementioned Abu\u0304 Ma\u0003shar alBalkh\u0131\u0304. Nonetheless, opposition to astrology was found among several prominent\nintellectuals as well, particularly from among the rationalist theologians known as the\nMu\u0003tazilites, e.g. Abu\u0304 al-Hudhayl al-\u0003Alla\u0304f (d. 227/842) and Abu\u0304 al-H\n. usayn al-Khayya\u0304t (d. 300/913); see Josef van Ess, Theology and Society in the Second and Third Centuries\nof the Hijra: A History of Religious Thought in Early Islam, Section One, The Near and\nMiddle East, trans.

Certain\nprophetic h.ad\u0131\u0304ths seem to represent views against astrological belief and practice, e.g.\nSunan Ab\u0131\u0304 Dawu\u0304d nos. 3905 and 3906 (Kita\u0304b al-Kiha\u0304nah wa-al-tat.ayyar/Ba\u0304b f\u0131\u0304 alnuju\u0304m, nos. 2 and 3).\n\nPages 13:\nGardiner \u0002 Stars and Saints\n(kalimah) was\u2014through the whole series of emanative planes and historical\ncycles\u2014translated into manifest events.43 As we will see, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 more fully\nfleshes out the notion that God\u2019s speech is manifested via astrological forces,\nparticularly in his unusual doctrine of the forty-eight letters. In doing so he\nbuilds on the notion of Adam as microcosm to grant Sufi adepts and saints an\nimportant place in that process.\nA L - B U\u0304N\u0131\u0304 \u2019S ESOTERICIST ASTROLOGY\nIt is stated at several points in the Qur\u0002a\u0304n that, in creating the things of the\ncosmos, God says \u201cBe!\u201d and \u201cit is\u201d (kun fa-yaku\u0304n).44 Creation, in short, is a\ndivine speech-act\u2014a relatively straightforward theological principle upon\nwhich the elaborate cosmologies of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 and other lettrists are founded.\nFor al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304, the letters of God\u2019s speech pervade the cosmos, being integral\nto its various planes just as they are to the intellect, spirit, soul, and body of\nAdam and his progeny. One of the numerous striking diagrams that populate\nLat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t is a cosmograph of a type familiar from works of Ptolemaic\nastronomy from around the medieval Mediterranean: a series of concentric\nrings representing the firmament and the spheres of the planets with the earth\nat the center (see Figure). In al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s figure there are thirteen rings\u2014the\noutermost one for the divine Throne that is the Intellect and the sphere of\nthe Primum Mobile, the next for the divine Footstool that is the World Soul\nand the firmament of fixed stars, the following seven for the spheres (afla\u0304k)\nof the classical planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon),\nand the final four for the elements of the sublunary realm (fire, air, water,\nearth).45 Each of these spheres is associated with two letters of the alphabet,\naccounting for twenty-six of the twenty-eight Arabic letters; the other two\nletters are associated with the Pen and Tablet, the former being the \u201csecond\nworld of origination\u201d and the spirit of holiness that moves throughout the\ncosmos, and the latter, as the \u201csecond world of origination,\u201d comprising all\nthe planetary and elementary rings. At the center of the figure is written \u201cthe\nworld as disposed by the letters\u201d (\u0003a\u0304lam al-tas.r\u0131\u0304f bi-al-h.uru\u0304f ), which is to say\nthe manifest world that is shaped by the letters radiating from the celestial\nspheres.46\n43.

Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s view of the relationship between the celestial spheres and the\nletters is similar. As Gril summarizes it: \u201cFar from being original or simple entities . . .\n51\n\nPages 14:\n52\nMagic, Ritual, and Witchcraft \u0002 Spring 2017\n\u201c[As for] the letters,\u201d al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 tell us, \u201cGod brought the world into existence by means of them, making them to be the signs of signs [a\u0003la\u0304m al-a\u0003la\u0304m]\nand the secrets of the judgements [asra\u0304r al-ah.ka\u0304m].\u201d The description of the\nletters as a\u0003la\u0304m al-a\u0003la\u0304m is polysemic; an \u0003alam can be a star or asterism as well\nas a sign or letter, such that the phrase can be the \u201csign of a sign,\u201d \u201cthe\nsign of a star,\u201d \u201cthe star of a letter,\u201d etc. The term \u201cjudgements\u201d (ah.ka\u0304m) is\nimmediately evocative of astrological divination, the art of astrology traditionally being known in Arabic as \u0003ilm ah.ka\u0304m al-nuju\u0304m, the science of the\njudgements of the stars. Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 posits far greater powers for the letters than\nsimple prediction, however: \u201cThrough them God\u2019s greatest name is made\nknown, and through them is made known the speech of the people of paradise in the next world, and by means of them the speech of God the Highest\nis heard through the unveiling in the presence of the highest spirit of holiness.\u201d47 This refers to the process by which holy books and other wisdom are\nrevealed to prophets by the angel Gabriel (Jibr\u0131\u0304l), indicating that the letters\nare at the heart of prophecy itself, and thus at the heart of Islam.48 The adepts\nversed in these secrets take care to protect them, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 assures us, \u201clest\nthose who have gone astray [ahl al-d.ala\u0304la\u0304t] happen upon them, and by means\nof them expose that which God keeps sacred.\u201d49\nTHE FORTY-EIGHT LETTERS\nHaving asserted the powers of the letters in shaping the world, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nexposition takes an unforeseen turn when he clarifies that the letters of which\nhe speaks are forty-eight in number\u2014rather than twenty-eight, as one would\n[the] letters themselves are produced by the rotation and interaction of a specific\nnumber of celestial spheres (afla\u0304k) among all the spheres that move concentrically\nwithin the total, ultimate sphere (al-falak al-aqs.a\u0304). Along with bringing the letters into\nexistence, the rotation of the spheres combines physical qualities (heat, cold, dryness,\nand humidity) together in pairs. The letters are thus located on the edge of the physical world (t.ab\u0131\u0304\u0003ah), since these qualities or Original Elements (al-\u0003ana\u0304s.ir al-uwal) give\nbirth to the physical elements (fire, air, water, and earth) when they combine. . . .\nThe science of letters can thus not be looked at independently of the science of the\nheavenly bodies or of the cosmic cycles\u201d; Gril, \u201cThe Science of Letters,\u201d 108.\n47.

The numbers seven and twelve, being the numbers\nof planets and zodiacal signs (or astrological houses) respectively, hint that\nreferences to astrology will be forthcoming, and al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 does not disappoint.\nIndeed, it is in al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s description of the forty-eight letters that we see the\nextent to which he seeks to reorient his readers to an esotericist understanding of astrology, revealing the apparent powers of the planets as the continuous action of God\u2019s names on the earth, linking the zodiac to the differential\ncapacity of humans to receive God\u2019s word\u2014and thereby implying an important role for Sufi saints and adepts in the process of astrological causation\u2014\nand reimagining the sublunary world, which is to say manifest reality, as a\nfabric of letters in a constant flux driven by the movements of the celestial\nspheres. None of this is to say that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 denounces or abandons astrology\u2019s\n\u201couter\u201d forms. Rather, particularly with regard to the material world, he\nengages to a considerable degree with conventional astrology.\nThe seven luciform letters, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 tells us, are not letters in the usual\nsense, but rather that name is a figure of speech (maja\u0304z) concealing a secret\nfor the initiated (li-sirr al-tabl\u0131\u0304gh). He is indeed less than straightforward about\nthe true nature of these so-called letters, resorting to actual code in describing\nthem.\nThey [the luciform letters] are different lights not with regard to their essences, but\nrather with regard to one who perceives them. They are referred to as the two, the\none, the thirty, the sixty, the eighty, the one, and the four hundred; these [numbers]\nare a link [nisbah] to the luciform letters. Were it not for these luciform letters, God\n(Most High) would not be known, and the created beings would not be disposed\nupon the planes of unity.50\nThe most obvious solution to the numerical code is through abjad, the Arabic\nsystem of assigning numerical values to the letter. Applying the abjad values\nused in the Islamic West (a preference al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 makes clear elsewhere in the\ntext),51 the numbers yield the phrase bi-al-s.ifa\u0304t, \u201cby means of the attributes\u201d;\n50.

This\nmust be taken as referring to the \u201cbeautiful names of God\u201d (al-asma\u0304\u0002 al-h.usna\u0304)\nfound in the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, notionally ninety-nine in number, an important subset\nof which are referred to by theologians as God\u2019s \u201cattributes\u201d (s.ifa\u0304t). The identification of the luciform letters with the attributes also fits well with al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nassertion that the luciform letters differ from the point of view of the receiver,\nbut not in their essence\u2014just as God is one in His essence but known to\nhumans through a multitude of names.\nThe attributes, which are names describing divine powers or properties\nsuch as \u201cthe Knowing\u201d (al-\u0003al\u0131\u0304m), \u201cthe Hearing\u201d (al-sam\u0131\u0304\u0003), etc., were a frequent point of controversy in Muslim theology in relation to debates about\nthe absolute unity of God, anthropomorphism, and other issues.52 For many\nSufi thinkers, the attributes (and the divine names generally) were considered\nvital links between divine and human realities, channels through which the\ndivine could manifest in the world, and through which adepts could attain\nhigher realities. Seven attributes in particular\u2014\u201cthe Living\u201d (al-h.ayy), \u201cthe\nSpeaking\u201d (al-mutakallim), \u201cthe Knowing\u201d (al-\u0003al\u0131\u0304m), \u201cthe Hearing\u201d (al-sam\u0131\u0304\u0003),\n\u201cthe Seeing\u201d (al-bas.\u0131\u0304r), \u201cthe Willing\u201d (al-mur\u0131\u0304d), and \u201cthe Powerful\u201d (alqad\u0131\u0304r)\u2014were regarded by many theologians and Sufis as the principal divine\nnames from which all the others derive,53 and it is quite possible that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\nhas these seven in mind with regard the seven luciform letters. Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 deals\nextensively with the divine names in his aforementioned work \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304,\npaying particular attention to spiritual exercises through which the Sufi practitioner can identify with the names and draw on their power (takhalluq).54\nAs al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s discussion of the \u201cspiritual\u201d and \u201ccorporeal\u201d letters proceeds, it\nbecomes clear that he identifies the power attributed to the planets in conventional astrology with that of the divine names. This seems to be not a\nsimple, one-to-one correspondence between the planets and names, but\nand western (maghrib\u0131\u0304), in which the values of four of the letters (s\u0131\u0304n, sh\u0131\u0304n, .sa\u0304d, d.a\u0304d)\nvary. Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 clearly employed the western values, as for example in Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t,\nfol. 14a-b.\n52.

These are twelve in number\naccording to al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s scheme: the faculty of hearing (quwwat al-sam\u0003), the\nfaculty of vision (quwwat al-bas.ar), the faculty of smell (quwwat al-shamm),\nthe faculty of taste (quwwat al-dhawq), the faculty of touch (quwwat al-lams),\nthe cogitative faculty (al-quwwah al-mufakkirah), the imaginative faculty (alquwwah al-khaya\u0304l\u0131\u0304yah), the formal faculty (al-quwwah al-mus.awwirah), the\nadministrative faculty (al-quwwah al-mudabbirah), the integrative faculty (alquwwah al-mushakkilah), the preserving faculty (al-quwwah al-h.a\u0304fiz.ah), and the\ndispositive faculty (al-quwwah al-mus.arrifah).56 The implication is that the\ntwelve spiritual letters/faculties fulfill the function of the zodiac in the sense\nof receiving the \u201cplanetary\u201d forces of the divine names and, as we will see,\nmediating their effects upon the manifest world. As with the luciform letters\nand the planets, he offers no one-to-one correspondence between the faculties and signs; however, the linking of the spiritual letters to the zodiac is\nconfirmed by his explicit comparison of the movement of the planets\nthrough the zodiacal signs to the shifting influences of the luciform letters on\nthe faculties: \u201c[A]s the celestial spheres, in their track through the zodiacal\nsigns, are measured according to degree and minute and so on, so the effect\nmanifests sequentially. . . . Likewise these twelve spiritual-lettristic faculties\ntake from the lights of the luciform letters, stage after stage, in accordance\nwith the mystery of a gradated sequence.\u201d57\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 goes into no further detail about the faculties, except to note that\nthey are not evenly developed among humans, being perfected in some and\nlacking in others.

A saint is someone extraordinarily advanced in this regard, such that God acts through him or her seamlessly, and who is thus a locus of spiritual power (barakah). In forging this link\nbetween astrology and Sufi notions of the individual capacity for receiving\nthe divine, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 might be seen as building on the importance of the individual human actor in horary astrology, each nativity being essentially unique.\nAs for the twenty-nine corporeal letters, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 explains that they are the\ntwenty-eight letters of the regular Arabic alphabet plus the ligature la\u0304m-alif\u2014\nthe latter is counted by some, including al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304, as a letter in its own right,\nthough it plays no obvious role in the elemental division of the letters he\noutlines. In a scheme reminiscent of Jabirian alchemical theory, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\ndivides the main twenty-eight letters into four groups corresponding to the\nelemental qualities: heat, moisture, dryness, and cold, such that there are\nseven \u201cd\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 1 to page 19 out of a total of 28.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a summary of the document <strong>&quot;Stars and Saints&quot;</strong> (pages 1 to 19 out of a total of 28):

The document discusses the esoteric astrology of the Sufi occultist Ahmad al-Buni and his work *Latāʾif al-Ishārāt fī al-Ḥurūf al-ʿUlwiyya*, a text central to the study of late medieval Sufism&#x27;s occult sciences. Al-Buni&#x27;s text explores the &quot;science of letters and names&quot; (*ʿilm al-ḥurūf wa-al-asmāʾ*) or &quot;lettrism,&quot; a practice similar to Jewish Kabbalah, focusing on the cosmic power of the Arabic alphabet and the names of God, often linked to occult practices such as divination and talismanic magic. 

Al-Buni&#x27;s work includes practical instructions on astrological magic, drawing on Sufi piety, distinguishing it from earlier works such as the *Ghāyat al-Ḥakīm* (known as *Picatrix*). He presents a cosmological framework, wherein the movements of celestial bodies (planets and stars) impact life on earth through divine forces. Al-Buni also discusses the role of Sufi saints and adepts (*awliyāʾ*) as mediators of these astral influences, reflecting broader Sufi views on saints&#x27; roles in executing God&#x27;s will on earth.

The latter point is a significant departure from conventional models of astrological causation, in which celestial rays have no\nneed of human mediators. It is quite in keeping, however, with the central\ncosmological importance al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 assigns to Adam and the \u201chuman cosmos\u201d\n(al-\u0003a\u0304lam al-insa\u0304n\u0131\u0304), whereby, as he discusses in \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304, humans are the\nonly created beings capable of fully bridging the highest and lowest planes of\nexistence.61 And it is in further keeping with a Sufi ethos in which reigned\nthe notion that the very existence of the world was sustained by a concealed\nhierarchy or college (d\u0131\u0304wa\u0304n) of living Sufi saints with miraculous powers. As\nfor the impact a saint might have on the \u201ccorporeal letters\u201d of the materiality\nof his or her surroundings, one is reminded of Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s discussion\nof how, as Michel Chodkiewicz summarizes it, \u201cthe passage of a saint or\nhis posthumous sojourn in a place establishes in it a field of beneficent\npower\u201d62 \u2014a notion central to the cult of saints and the practice of visiting\nsaints\u2019 tombs.\nThe idea of the invisible hierarchy of the saints has been an element of\nSufism since at least the ninth century, but it seems to have gained wider\ncurrency by the onset of the late medieval period, particularly in the Islamic\nWest. It would continue to do so across the Muslim world well into the early\nmodern period, particularly as theory met social practice in the rise of the\ncorporate Sufi brotherhoods. Among Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304\u2019s most influential contributions to Sufi thought is his visionary hagiology in which he details the\nvarious ranks of the saints, their spiritual and earthly functions, and related\ntopics.63 In Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-ishara\u0304t, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 is not centrally concerned with the hierarchy of the saints, though a version of the various ranks of saints does appear\n60.

As we will see, the talismanic practices outlined in the text, discussed briefly below, further bear out this model,\nas al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 emphasizes the importance of the spiritual accomplishment of the\noperator in the efficacy of such tools.\nA S T R O L O G Y A N D LE T T R I S M I N P R AC T I C E\nHowever radical al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s re-envisioning of the forces at work in astrology,\nhe does not eschew the importance of traditional astrological actors such as\nthe planets and zodiacal signs. Notably, he particularly embraces them in\nconnection with issues and practices set squarely in the manifest world. Such\nis the case in his discussion of practices for healing the human body, where\nhe links the zodiacal signs to the parts of the body\u2014a move he justifies by\nexplaining that the sun is linked to the human soul (al-shams hiya nisbat alnafs),65 such that the solar zodiac has dominion over the body. Aries (al-h.amal)\nhas dominion over the hair of the head, Taurus (al-thawr) over the forehead,\nGemini (al-jawza\u0304\u0002) over the eyes, and so on down to Pisces\u2019 (al-h.u\u0304t) dominion\nover the legs and feet. Each sign of the zodiac, he explains, is linked to an\nelement (fire, air, water, earth) that is a combination of two elemental qualities. Thus all seven of the \u201ccorporeal\u201d letters assigned to each of those qualities also correspond to the zodiacal sign they constitute, with the result that\nfourteen letters are attached to each sign. These letters are the keys to healing\nthe body through \u201cspiritual medicine\u201d (t.ibb ru\u0304h.a\u0304n\u0131\u0304). Armed with knowledge\nsive discussion of the saintly hierarchy see chapter 73 of his al-Futu\u0304h.a\u0304t al-Makk\u0131\u0304yah.\nFor a comparison of Muslim and Jewish concepts of a world-sustaining hierarchy of\nsaints, see Paul Fenton, \u201cThe Hierarchy of Saints in Jewish and Islamic Mysticism,\u201d\nJournal of the Muhyiddin Ibn \u0003Arabi Society 10 (1991): 12\u201334.\n64.

The titles of various ranks of saints\nare clustered along the left-hand column, e.g. \u201cthe poles\u201d (al-aqt.a\u0304b), \u201cthe substitutes\u201d\n(al-abda\u0304l), \u201cthe nobles\u201d (al-nujaba\u0304\u0002), \u201cthe leaders\u201d (al-nuqaba\u0304\u0002), etc. The present author\nwill discuss this and other of al- Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s diagrams in a forthcoming paper.\n65. Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304, Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t, fol. 28b.\n59\n\nPages 22:\n60\nMagic, Ritual, and Witchcraft \u0002 Spring 2017\nof the proper correspondences, the initiate can seek out verses of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n\nthat include all the letters appropriate to a given sign/part of the body and\nutilize them for healing, whether by praying with them, writing them on\npaper and then immersing it in water to be given to the sick person to drink,\netc.66 Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s utilization of the zodiacal signs in his .tibb ru\u0304h.a\u0304n\u0131\u0304 can be seen\nas a qualified acknowledgement of the validity and efficacy of the pre-Islamic\nastrological-medical thought to which it obviously hearkens back (melothesia,\niatromathematica, etc.), though the Qur\u0002a\u0304n is given pride of place as the therapeutic instrument par excellence. Thus he grants conventional astrology a substantial degree of legitimacy in the \u201couter\u201d world of everyday life and afflicted\nhuman bodies, while still proclaiming the text of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n to be the most\neffective tool for intervening on that reality, and thus supporting the superiority of Islamic revelation.\nAnother area where al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 explicitly engages with conventional astrology\nis with regard to the making of talismans, though it is also here that the\ntheory of the forty-eight letters can be seen in practical application. This is a\nprocess that, as one might expect from earlier works on astral magic such as\nGha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m/Picatrix, often entails the crafting of talismans under certain\nastral conditions, which is to say while certain planets are in conjunction in\na certain sign, etc. However, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s theory and practice of talismans is\nadditionally intertwined with his teachings on the names of God, and he pays\nsignificant attention to the purification of the mind and body of the practitioner as the channel through which a talisman is charged with the forces\nthat render it efficacious.67\nAt various places in Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 addresses a cluster of topics\nthat includes the letter da\u0304l, its numerical value of four, and names of God that\ninclude da\u0304l such as the attributes \u201cthe Permanent\u201d (al-da\u0304\u0002im) and \u201cthe Loving\u201d (al-wadu\u0304d). Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 also assigns the letter da\u0304l to the sphere of Jupiter,\nand, although he does not make the point explicitly, his discussion of the\nPermanent and the Loving emphasizes their denotation of God\u2019s beneficent,\n66. Ibid., fol. 29b.\n67. Many of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s works other than Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t are centrally concerned\nwith embodied \u201cspiritual practices\u201d (riya\u0304d.a\u0304t) familiar from the classical Sufi tradition,\ne.g. khalwah (ritual seclusion), supererogatory fasting, and dhikr and other forms of\nsupererogatory prayer. As mentioned above, a focus of \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304 is takhalluq\nthrough spiritual exercises centered on God\u2019s attributes, and another of al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\nworks, Mawa\u0304qif al-gha\u0304ya\u0304t f\u0131\u0304 asra\u0304r al-riya\u0304d.a\u0304t, is entirely dedicated to traditional Sufi practices, albeit with subtle lettrist inflections. In Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t, however, we see such\nspiritual exercises being directed especially at a higher capacity for disposing astrallettristic forces in the material world, particularly through the use of talismans.\n\nPages 23:\nGardiner \u0002 Stars and Saints\nnurturing, and administrative qualities\u2014virtues commonly associated with\nJupiter in Hellenistic astrology.\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 discusses a number of talismans associated with this cluster of da\u0304lelements. One relatively simple set of instructions is as follows:\nHe who writes the shape of [the letter] da\u0304l on a piece of white silk thirty-five times\nwhile the Moon is in Cancer and aligned favorably with Jupiter, and places it in his\nsignet-ring during that time and wears it while in a state of ritual purity, fasting, and\ncontinuous internal quietude (s.afa\u0304\u0002 al-ba\u0304t.in), God will make lasting for him the state\nof grace he is in, and support him in every external undertaking. And God will extend\nHis sustenance generously to one who multiplies [i.e. performs dhikr of] His name the\nPermanent if he has that [talisman] with him. We have explained it [God\u2019s generosity]\nextensively regarding His name the Permanent and the da\u0304l in al-h.amd [i.e. in the\ncommon phrase of blessing al-h.amd li-lla\u0304h] in our book \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304 . . . and its inner\n(ba\u0304t.in) meaning in [the chapter] on His name the Merciful (al-rah.ma\u0304n).68\nThe thirty-five times reflects the abjad value of da\u0304l when spelled out: da\u0304l \u2cf1 4,\nalif \u2cf1 1, la\u0304m \u2cf1 30. The prescribed astrological conditions for the making of\nthe talisman harness the energies of both Jupiter and Cancer, the sign in\nwhich Jupiter is exalted. Note, however, that the operator must himself be\nin a state of fasting, ritual purity, and internal quietude in order to effectively\nchannel these forces. It is also best if the talisman is employed in combination\nwith dhikr of the appropriate divine name\u2014dhikr being a form of prayer\nspecial to Sufism, which involves the repetitive chanting of one or more\ndivine names, often in tandem with various breathing practices and rhythmic\nmovements. The reader is also referred to \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304 for al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s more\ndetailed discourse on the forces of mercy and beneficence linked to the letter\nda\u0304l. In sum, the material talisman would seem to be harnessing forces emanating from the powers of the divine names that are linked through the letter\nda\u0304l to the sphere of Jupiter, channeling them through the purified soul and\nbody of the adept into the talisman. The effects of the talisman are fittingly\nconcordant with the Jovian divine qualities al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 associates with the da\u0304lnames.\n68.

For this procedure the adept must fast for two weeks,\neating nothing but bread, maintaining a state of ritual purity throughout, and\nregularly invoking God\u2019s name while meditating on a sheet of silver. On a\nThursday (traditionally the day of Jupiter), in the hour of Jupiter, on a day\nwhen the moon is favorably aligned with Jupiter and the sun, and when the\nascending lunar node is in Gemini (in which the ascending node is exalted),\nhe is to inscribe the square on the sheet of silver while facing the qiblah and\nburning mastic and white oud. He is then to wear the talisman on Thursdays,\nand God will make easy for him his religious obligations, provide him with\nall his necessities, and grant him barakah \u201cin all that his hand attempts\u201d (f\u0131\u0304 kull\nma\u0304 tuh.a\u0304wiluhu yadihi).69\nThe operation would be entirely at home in Gha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m or a similar\nwork, except that the astrological image that such a work would call for on\nthe talisman has been replaced with the grid of numbers and letters. The\ncharacter of the operation is further transformed by al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s commentary\non the names and forces associated with da\u0304l, and his extensive framing of the\n\u201cworlds and interworlds\u201d that underlie manifest reality, in which the letters\nand numbers exist as angelic entities in their own right. In addition, his focus\non the asceticism and ritual purity of the practitioner emphasizes the notion\nof the Sufi adept as the ideal conduit through which such forces can be\nchanneled. Much as with his \u201cspiritual medicine,\u201d however, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 nevertheless acknowledges a significant degree of technical legitimacy to conventional astrology, particularly with regard to the timing of operations. This\nagain suggests that he credits the pre-Islamic science as valid knowledge with\nregard to the \u201couter\u201d world and the observable aspects of the celestial spheres,\nwhile yet privileging the power of God\u2019s saints and the lettrist understanding\nof Islamic revelation as the true keys to understanding and manipulating the\nhidden secrets of the creation.\nCONCLUSION\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s approach to astrology is esotericist in that, like the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, the\n\u201cprofane\u201d astrology of the Hellenistic cum Ma\u0003shar\u0131\u0304 tradition is implied to\nhave hidden depths of meaning. What non-initiates assume to be the effects\nof the stars is understood by the lettrist adept as aspects of the manifold power\n69. Ibid., fol. 21b.\n\nPages 25:\nGardiner \u0002 Stars and Saints\nof God\u2019s speech. Thus the Sufi saints and adepts\u2019 relationship to the letters\nthat convey both the Qur\u0002a\u0304n and the forces emanating from the heavens\ntranscends the merely discursive knowledge traded in by ordinary Muslim\nexegetes and jurists on the one hand, and vulgar astrologers on the other.\nRather than merely reading the Qur\u0002a\u0304nic and celestial \u201ctexts,\u201d the Sufis\u2019 souls\nand bodies are the channels through which God\u2019s world-making speech is\nmost purely manifested and disposed. It is an extraordinary set of claims on alBu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s part, one that reconfigures the relationship between divine and human\nagency by granting a quasi-naturalistic basis to the miraculous powers attributed to the Sufi saints, while yet affirming their transcendent spiritual authority as the selfless vehicles of God\u2019s word.\nAs mentioned at the outset of this paper, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 intended his written\nteachings only for a select audience of Sufi initiates, and communities of\nlearned Sufis in Egypt and environs indeed seem to have kept his writings\nlargely to themselves for a century or so after his death. This air of secrecy is\nbut one indication that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 and his early readers were aware that his\nteachings might attract severe criticism from religious authorities. Thus, if\nLat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t can be taken as an attempt to reconcile astrology and Islam,\nthen this reconciliation was not one that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 intended to be carried out\npublicly, but only among the networks of peers and followers that he and\nother members of his western Sufi cohort were building as they traveled east\naround the turn of the thirteenth century.\nThe historian of Jewish thought Moshe Halbertal has described the twelfth\nand thirteenth centuries CE as \u201cthe age of esotericism and its disclosure,\u201d70 a\nperiod in which secrecy and elitism were important features of Jewish discourses ranging from Kabbalah, to the occultism-infused exegetical efforts of\nAbraham b. Ezra (d. between 1164 and 1167 CE), to the distinctly nonoccultist philosophy of Maimonides (d. 1204 CE). This trend emerged\nlargely in the Muslim-ruled western Mediterranean, and its florescence in the\nsame period and region as produced such Muslim esotericists extraordinaire as\nal-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 and Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304 is one hint that the trend was transconfessional.\nVarious scholars have noted that the air de famille which pertains between\nKabbalah and western-Sufi lettrism\u2014with their shared fascinations with\nsacred alphabets, divine names, the primordial Adam, emanationist cosmology, and theurgy\u2014suggests significant cross-fertilization between the discourses.71\n70. Moshe Halbertal, Concealment and Revelation: Esotericism in Jewish Thought and\nits Philosophical Implications, trans. Jackie Feldman (Princeton: Princeton University\nPress, 2007), 5.\n71. The comparative study of these discourses is mostly in its infancy. For a sam-\n63\n\nPages 26:\n64\nMagic, Ritual, and Witchcraft \u0002 Spring 2017\nAn important function of Jewish esotericism was that, in claiming access\nto initiated understandings of holy texts, esotericists of the period forged\nnovel connections between scripture and various philosophical and occultscientific discourses\u2014all while claiming to reveal the primordial essence of\nJewish scripture. As Halbertal puts it, \u201c[t]he esoteric idea provides a new and\npowerful tool to exegesis as a means of receiving ideas and transforming them\ninto an integral part of the tradition.\u201d72 Ibn Ezra, for example, reads Torah\nagainst the grain of the mainstream exegetical tradition to \u201creveal\u201d layers of\ncosmological and astrological meaning that he claims as the inner meaning of\nscripture known only to the elite few, even going so far as to interpret ancient\nJewish ritual practices as a means of drawing down power from the heavens\na\u0300 la an astral talisman from Gha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m.73Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 similarly locates the\nmetaphysical underpinnings of an astrologically-charged cosmos in the hidden meanings of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, legitimating thereby the utilization of various\nelements of astrology while still vouchsafing the superiority of Islamic revelation.\nHalbertal also offers the view that the innovative exegetical efforts of Jewish esotericists were symptomatic of a crisis of dissatisfaction with traditional\nreligious thought, and of a shift toward causal explanations of reality that\nutilized \u201cnature as the central explanatory category.\u201d This was particularly\napparent, he argues, in a changing conception of prayer in which what long\nhad been viewed as humanity\u2019s means of appeasing a personal God came to\nbe articulated as methods by which humans could activate essentially impersonal forces in order to remake the world.74 Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s lettrist-talismanic practices seem largely to fit this pattern, particularly insofar as he \u201castrologizes\u201d\npling see Vahid Brown, \u201cAndalus\u0131\u0304 Mysticism: A Recontextualization,\u201d in Journal of\nIslamic Philosophy 2 (2006): 69\u2013101; Michael Ebstein and Tzahi Weiss, \u201cA Drama in\nHeaven: \u2018Emanation on the Left\u2019 in Kabbalah and a Parallel Cosmogonic Myth in\nIsma\u0304\u0003\u0131\u0304l\u0131\u0304 Literature,\u201d History of Religions 55 (2015): 148\u201371; Ronald Kiener, \u201cJewish\nMysticism in the Lands of the Ishmaelites: A Re-Orientation,\u201d in The Convergence of\nJudaism and Islam: Religious, Scientific, and Cultural Dimensions, ed.

It is perhaps better that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s ideas be considered one of the\nstreams contributing to the formation of \u201cthe Sufi-philosophical (or philosophical-Sufi) amalgam\u201d that Shahab Ahmed recently described as having\nemerged in the Muslim world during the transition from the late medieval\nto early modern periods, and that predominated in much of Muslim culture\nfor centuries.76 Best of all, we might recognize that the daring esotericism of\nal-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 and his fellow lettrists causes their ideas to cut across the borders\nmodern scholarship has sought to erect between the histories of theology,\nmysticism, philosophy, and science, and that to study their place in intellectual history requires a willingness to follow their lines of flight across such\ntraditional disciplinary categories.\n75.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The continuation of the document <strong>&quot;Stars and Saints&quot;</strong> (pages 20-28) delves further into the interplay between divine forces, celestial influences, and human mediation in the Sufi tradition. Key points include:

1. <strong>Human Mediation and Celestial Influence</strong>: Al-Buni discusses how human beings, particularly Sufi saints, serve as intermediaries who transmit the divine names&#x27; celestial influence to the earthly realm. Unlike traditional astrological models where celestial bodies act independently, al-Buni emphasizes the necessity of human mediation.

2. <strong>Sufi Saints and Hierarchy</strong>: The concept of an invisible hierarchy of saints (*awliyāʾ*), prevalent since the 9th century, is emphasized, with a specific focus on how saints mediate divine forces through their spiritual accomplishments. This is aligned with Ibn al-Arabi’s discussions of saints and their cosmic roles.

3. <strong>Astrology and Healing</strong>: Al-Buni’s work also covers astrological signs and their influence on the human body. Each sign corresponds to a body part, and he links these signs to divine names that can be invoked for healing, further blending Islamic spiritual practices with astrological knowledge.

4. <strong>Talismanic Practices</strong>: Practical instructions on crafting talismans under specific astrological conditions are provided, highlighting the importance of spiritual purity for the practitioner. These talismans are seen as tools for channeling divine forces, closely tied to the divine names and astrological alignments.

5. <strong>Esotericism and Secrecy</strong>: Al-Buni&#x27;s teachings were intended for a select audience, reflecting the esoteric nature of his work. His synthesis of Islamic revelation with astrological and lettrist traditions is noted as a careful balance between maintaining orthodoxy and advancing occult knowledge.

As we will see, the talismanic practices outlined in the text, discussed briefly below, further bear out this model,\nas al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 emphasizes the importance of the spiritual accomplishment of the\noperator in the efficacy of such tools.\nA S T R O L O G Y A N D LE T T R I S M I N P R AC T I C E\nHowever radical al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s re-envisioning of the forces at work in astrology,\nhe does not eschew the importance of traditional astrological actors such as\nthe planets and zodiacal signs. Notably, he particularly embraces them in\nconnection with issues and practices set squarely in the manifest world. Such\nis the case in his discussion of practices for healing the human body, where\nhe links the zodiacal signs to the parts of the body\u2014a move he justifies by]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20\nthe superior influences [i.e. those from the luciform letters] in the earthly\nsphere.\u201d60\nThus al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 seems to suggest not only that the powers attributed to the\nplanets are really those of the divine names, but also that humans are an\nindispensable element in the reception of the influence of the divine names\ninto the material world. The latter point is a significant departure from conventional models of astrological causation, in which celestial rays have no\nneed of human mediators. It is quite in keeping, however, with the central\ncosmological importance al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 assigns to Adam and the \u201chuman cosmos\u201d\n(al-\u0003a\u0304lam al-insa\u0304n\u0131\u0304), whereby, as he discusses in \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304, humans are the\nonly created beings capable of fully bridging the highest and lowest planes of\nexistence.61 And it is in further keeping with a Sufi ethos in which reigned\nthe notion that the very existence of the world was sustained by a concealed]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26\nagainst the grain of the mainstream exegetical tradition to \u201creveal\u201d layers of\ncosmological and astrological meaning that he claims as the inner meaning of\nscripture known only to the elite few, even going so far as to interpret ancient\nJewish ritual practices as a means of drawing down power from the heavens\na\u0300 la an astral talisman from Gha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m.73Al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 similarly locates the\nmetaphysical underpinnings of an astrologically-charged cosmos in the hidden meanings of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, legitimating thereby the utilization of various\nelements of astrology while still vouchsafing the superiority of Islamic revelation.\nHalbertal also offers the view that the innovative exegetical efforts of Jewish esotericists were symptomatic of a crisis of dissatisfaction with traditional\nreligious thought, and of a shift toward causal explanations of reality that\nutilized \u201cnature as the central explanatory category.\u201d This was particularly]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=18\nPages: 18\nconfirmed by his explicit comparison of the movement of the planets\nthrough the zodiacal signs to the shifting influences of the luciform letters on\nthe faculties: \u201c[A]s the celestial spheres, in their track through the zodiacal\nsigns, are measured according to degree and minute and so on, so the effect\nmanifests sequentially. . . .

One relatively simple set of instructions is as follows:\nHe who writes the shape of [the letter] da\u0304l on a piece of white silk thirty-five times\nwhile the Moon is in Cancer and aligned favorably with Jupiter, and places it in his\nsignet-ring during that time and wears it while in a state of ritual purity, fasting, and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=21\nPages: 21\nhe links the zodiacal signs to the parts of the body\u2014a move he justifies by\nexplaining that the sun is linked to the human soul (al-shams hiya nisbat alnafs),65 such that the solar zodiac has dominion over the body. Aries (al-h.amal)\nhas dominion over the hair of the head, Taurus (al-thawr) over the forehead,\nGemini (al-jawza\u0304\u0002) over the eyes, and so on down to Pisces\u2019 (al-h.u\u0304t) dominion\nover the legs and feet. Each sign of the zodiac, he explains, is linked to an\nelement (fire, air, water, earth) that is a combination of two elemental qualities. Thus all seven of the \u201ccorporeal\u201d letters assigned to each of those qualities also correspond to the zodiacal sign they constitute, with the result that\nfourteen letters are attached to each sign. These letters are the keys to healing\nthe body through \u201cspiritual medicine\u201d (t.ibb ru\u0304h.a\u0304n\u0131\u0304).

He furthermore implies a central role for Sufi adepts\n(muh.aqqiqu\u0304n) and saints (awliya\u0304\u0002) in mediating these astral-lettristic radiations,\nadding a uniquely occult-scientific twist to views deeply embedded in Sufi\ntradition\u2014and premodern Muslim culture generally\u2014of the saints as key\nexecutors of God\u2019s word and will on earth. In the conclusion, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s\napproach to astrology is discussed as part of a transconfessional wave of esotericism in the late medieval Mediterranean, one that heralded shifting ideas\nabout the order of nature and the relationship between divine and human\nagency.\nAH\n.

Much as with his \u201cspiritual medicine,\u201d however, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 nevertheless acknowledges a significant degree of technical legitimacy to conventional astrology, particularly with regard to the timing of operations. This\nagain suggests that he credits the pre-Islamic science as valid knowledge with\nregard to the \u201couter\u201d world and the observable aspects of the celestial spheres,\nwhile yet privileging the power of God\u2019s saints and the lettrist understanding\nof Islamic revelation as the true keys to understanding and manipulating the\nhidden secrets of the creation.\nCONCLUSION\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s approach to astrology is esotericist in that, like the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, the\n\u201cprofane\u201d astrology of the Hellenistic cum Ma\u0003shar\u0131\u0304 tradition is implied to\nhave hidden depths of meaning.

He emphasizes, however, that the powers\nof the seven luciform letters do not act directly on the corporeal letters, but\nrather only through the mediation of the twelve spiritual letters that are the\nhuman faculties\u2014much as the powers of the planets are mediated by the\nsigns and houses in conventional astrology.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document discusses <strong>astral influences</strong> primarily in relation to how the celestial spheres and the divine names impact the material world. Al-Buni emphasizes that astral forces, like the powers attributed to the planets, are actually manifestations of divine names. This perspective re-envisions astrology, where traditional astrological forces are mediated through human beings, especially Sufi saints, who can channel these celestial influences through their spiritual purity. Al-Buni also links astrological forces to talismanic practices, where the practitioner must be spiritually pure to effectively channel these astral forces. This esoteric approach integrates Islamic cosmology with astrology, portraying divine speech as the key force behind both celestial and terrestrial realities.

<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>give me a more detailed summary of astral influences</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here&#x27;s a more detailed explanation of the <strong>astral influences</strong> as discussed in *Stars and Saints* by Al-Buni, based on the concepts found in the text:

### 1. <strong>Cosmological Framework</strong>:
   - Al-Buni presents a cosmological model where astral influences are not just a mechanical result of planetary movements, but rather expressions of divine forces. The celestial bodies, especially planets and zodiac signs, serve as conduits for the divine names and their inherent powers. In this system, planets are linked with specific divine names, and their astrological power derives from the divine forces they channel rather than from themselves.

   - <strong>Luciform Letters</strong>: Al-Buni emphasizes that the powers attributed to celestial bodies are actually the divine names associated with these bodies, often described as &quot;luciform letters.&quot; These letters, in his cosmology, emanate divine light and exert their influence on the material world through celestial intermediaries, such as planets and stars. Humans, particularly saints and spiritually purified individuals, can act as mediators to receive and direct these influences.

   - <strong>Human Mediation</strong>: In contrast to conventional astrology, where celestial rays act directly on the earthly plane, Al-Buni argues that human beings, especially Sufi saints, are necessary for mediating these astral influences. Through their spiritual purity and connection to God, saints act as intermediaries, transmitting divine power from the celestial bodies to the earthly realm. This marks a significant departure from earlier models of astrology where human intervention was not considered necessary.

   You can explore this concept in the document [here, page 20](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=20).

### 2. <strong>Astrology and Lettrism</strong>:
   - Al-Buni doesn’t completely reject traditional astrology but reformulates it within his mystical framework. He retains the importance of planetary positions, zodiac signs, and their association with earthly matters such as health, but overlays these concepts with his *ʿilm al-ḥurūf* (science of letters). 

   - <strong>Healing and Body Parts</strong>: Each sign of the zodiac is linked to specific parts of the body, such as Aries with the head, Taurus with the neck, and Pisces with the feet. In Al-Buni’s system, these signs are also connected to divine names, and using this knowledge, an adept can perform healing through the recitation of certain Qur&#x27;anic verses or through talismans. The talismans themselves are created under certain planetary conditions to harness the astral influences of the divine names for medical or spiritual purposes.

   This is discussed in [page 21 of the document](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=21).

### 3. <strong>Talismanic Practices</strong>:
   - In Al-Buni&#x27;s system, talismans are charged with divine forces by aligning their creation with specific celestial configurations, such as the conjunction of planets in certain zodiac signs. However, the practitioner’s own spiritual purity and readiness play a crucial role in the success of these operations. For instance, fasting, maintaining ritual purity, and invoking the correct divine names at the right astrological moment are necessary for the talisman to be effective.

   - <strong>Practical Application</strong>: One example from the text is the creation of a talisman by writing the letter *dal* on silk while the moon is in Cancer and aligned with Jupiter. The letter *dal* is connected to specific divine names like &quot;The Permanent&quot; (al-Dā&#x27;im) and &quot;The Loving&quot; (al-Wadūd), and its powers are associated with the planet Jupiter, reflecting virtues of beneficence and protection.

   This is further elaborated on [page 24 of the document](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=24).

### 4. <strong>Comparison with Other Esoteric Traditions</strong>:
   - Al-Buni’s esoteric astrology, with its emphasis on divine names and celestial forces, shares similarities with Jewish Kabbalistic thought, where sacred alphabets and divine names play a similar role in mediating cosmic forces. Both traditions see humans, particularly saints or sages, as key figures who can access and direct these astral influences for the benefit of the earthly world.

   - <strong>Spiritual Exercises</strong>: Al-Buni’s work also involves rigorous spiritual practices (riyaḍāt), such as fasting and seclusion, which are intended to enhance the practitioner’s capacity to channel these astral forces. The combination of Islamic revelation and lettrist astrology creates a unique mystical framework in which saints and spiritually attuned individuals can actively manipulate the hidden secrets of the cosmos.

   This synthesis of esotericism is discussed in the conclusion of the document [here, page 27](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=27).

In summary, <strong>astral influences</strong> in Al-Buni’s mystical system are fundamentally intertwined with divine forces, and human beings, particularly saints, act as crucial intermediaries for these forces. His lettristic-astrological practices go beyond traditional astrology by incorporating spiritual purification and divine names into astrological operations, creating a framework where celestial bodies are channels for divine speech rather than independent sources of influence.</div>

He emphasizes, however, that the powers\nof the seven luciform letters do not act directly on the corporeal letters, but\nrather only through the mediation of the twelve spiritual letters that are the\nhuman faculties\u2014much as the powers of the planets are mediated by the\nsigns and houses in conventional astrology.

None of this is to say that al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 denounces or abandons astrology\u2019s\n\u201couter\u201d forms. Rather, particularly with regard to the material world, he\nengages to a considerable degree with conventional astrology.\nThe seven luciform letters, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 tells us, are not letters in the usual\nsense, but rather that name is a figure of speech (maja\u0304z) concealing a secret\nfor the initiated (li-sirr al-tabl\u0131\u0304gh). He is indeed less than straightforward about\nthe true nature of these so-called letters, resorting to actual code in describing\nthem.\nThey [the luciform letters] are different lights not with regard to their essences, but]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16\nthem.\nThey [the luciform letters] are different lights not with regard to their essences, but\nrather with regard to one who perceives them. They are referred to as the two, the\none, the thirty, the sixty, the eighty, the one, and the four hundred; these [numbers]\nare a link [nisbah] to the luciform letters. Were it not for these luciform letters, God\n(Most High) would not be known, and the created beings would not be disposed\nupon the planes of unity.50\nThe most obvious solution to the numerical code is through abjad, the Arabic\nsystem of assigning numerical values to the letter. Applying the abjad values\nused in the Islamic West (a preference al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 makes clear elsewhere in the\ntext),51 the numbers yield the phrase bi-al-s.ifa\u0304t, \u201cby means of the attributes\u201d;\n50.

This led lettrist thinkers to assert that\nplumbing the depths of the Qur\u0002a\u0304n could facilitate the acquisition of extraordinary knowledge and power over the created world. It also led to the startling supposition that the letters of the Arabic alphabet which constitute the\nQur\u0002a\u0304n are also the very prima materia of the creation, the \u201cprimordial building-blocks\u201d of the manifest world.33\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 was a full-throated participant in this discourse, such that much\nof Lat.a\u0304\u0002if al-isha\u0304ra\u0304t is dedicated to the framing of a quasi-Neoplatonic,34 emanationist cosmology in which the letters of the Arabic alphabet and the divine\nAndalus: Ibn Masarra, Ibn al-\u0003Arab\u0131\u0304 and Isma\u0304\u0003\u0131\u0304l\u0131\u0304 Tradition (Leiden: Brill, 2014); and the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=21\nPages: 21\nreceiving the divine signal, would transmit the forces of the luciform letters/\ndivine names most purely and efficiently.

Over the course of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, the strain of lettrism that developed among\nwestern Sufis would come to emphasize the role of the names of God\u2014and\nthe letters of which they are composed\u2014in the creation and ongoing sustenance of the cosmos, and to position lettrism as a secret \u201cscience of the saints\u201d\n(\u0003ilm al-awliya\u0304\u0002) through which God\u2019s elite servants divined and helped guide\nthe order of the world.31\nConnections between esotericist scriptural hermeneutics and cosmological\nspeculation run deep in Islamic thought, as reflected in the Orientalist and\nphilosopher Henry Corbin\u2019s compelling axiom that an esotericist approach\nto scripture necessarily \u201cpresupposes the superimposition of worlds and interworlds, as the correlative basis for a plurality of meanings in the same text.\u201d32]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nletters as a\u0003la\u0304m al-a\u0003la\u0304m is polysemic; an \u0003alam can be a star or asterism as well\nas a sign or letter, such that the phrase can be the \u201csign of a sign,\u201d \u201cthe\nsign of a star,\u201d \u201cthe star of a letter,\u201d etc. The term \u201cjudgements\u201d (ah.ka\u0304m) is\nimmediately evocative of astrological divination, the art of astrology traditionally being known in Arabic as \u0003ilm ah.ka\u0304m al-nuju\u0304m, the science of the\njudgements of the stars.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>luciform letters</strong> in *Stars and Saints* represent a central concept in Al-Buni’s mystical and astrological framework. These letters are not physical symbols in the traditional sense but are rather expressions of divine light (*nūr*), acting as intermediaries between the celestial realm and the material world. Here&#x27;s a detailed explanation based on the document:

1. <strong>Nature of Luciform Letters</strong>:
   - Luciform letters are described as emanations of divine light, which influence the cosmos. According to Al-Buni, these letters do not differ in essence but in how they are perceived by human consciousness. Their purpose is to transmit divine powers into the material world. These letters function as channels through which God&#x27;s will and the divine names operate within the universe.
   - They act upon celestial spheres and are tied to astrological forces. Al-Buni states, “The occult force (*rūḥāniyya*) of every heavenly sphere is determined by the lights of every one of the luciform letters” [Stars and Saints, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=17).

2. <strong>Cosmological Role</strong>:
   - The luciform letters are said to be the foundational elements of the cosmos, and all existence is shaped by their influence. Al-Buni compares the movement of the planets and zodiac signs to the shifting effects of the luciform letters on human faculties. Just as celestial bodies move and affect the earthly realm, the luciform letters influence human perception and spiritual states in a sequential manner, revealing a hierarchical order of divine influence.
   - He explains that the powers of the seven luciform letters are mediated through twelve spiritual letters (which correspond to human faculties) before acting on the corporeal world. These faculties include hearing, vision, and cognition, reflecting how human beings experience the divine through these intermediary forces [Stars and Saints, pages 18-19](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=18).

3. <strong>Mystical Interpretation</strong>:
   - Al-Buni frames these letters within a larger mystical and lettrist system, where their spiritual power is derived from their association with divine names. For example, he ties the luciform letters to the seven divine attributes—such as &quot;The Knowing&quot; (*al-‘Alīm*) and &quot;The Powerful&quot; (*al-Qadīr*)—suggesting that each luciform letter carries with it the essence of one of these divine attributes. Through these letters, humans can interact with the divine reality, facilitating spiritual ascent and mystical experiences [Stars and Saints, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=17).

4. <strong>Secret Knowledge</strong>:
   - The true nature of the luciform letters is hidden and revealed only to initiates who can grasp their spiritual significance. Al-Buni uses coded language to describe them, indicating that they are part of a deeper esoteric tradition known to a select few. These letters represent hidden truths about the cosmos and God, making them essential to the mystical practice of those who are spiritually attuned [Stars and Saints, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=16).

In summary, <strong>luciform letters</strong> are divine forces expressed through light, acting as the medium through which celestial and spiritual influences are channeled into the material world. They are central to Al-Buni&#x27;s lettrist philosophy, integrating divine attributes, human faculties, and astrological forces.

This is a\nprocess that, as one might expect from earlier works on astral magic such as\nGha\u0304yat al-h.ak\u0131\u0304m/Picatrix, often entails the crafting of talismans under certain\nastral conditions, which is to say while certain planets are in conjunction in\na certain sign, etc. However, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s theory and practice of talismans is\nadditionally intertwined with his teachings on the names of God, and he pays\nsignificant attention to the purification of the mind and body of the practitioner as the channel through which a talisman is charged with the forces\nthat render it efficacious.67]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=24\nPages: 24\nof the Sufi adept as the ideal conduit through which such forces can be\nchanneled. Much as with his \u201cspiritual medicine,\u201d however, al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 nevertheless acknowledges a significant degree of technical legitimacy to conventional astrology, particularly with regard to the timing of operations. This\nagain suggests that he credits the pre-Islamic science as valid knowledge with\nregard to the \u201couter\u201d world and the observable aspects of the celestial spheres,\nwhile yet privileging the power of God\u2019s saints and the lettrist understanding\nof Islamic revelation as the true keys to understanding and manipulating the\nhidden secrets of the creation.\nCONCLUSION\nAl-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304\u2019s approach to astrology is esotericist in that, like the Qur\u0002a\u0304n, the\n\u201cprofane\u201d astrology of the Hellenistic cum Ma\u0003shar\u0131\u0304 tradition is implied to\nhave hidden depths of meaning.

Aries (al-h.amal)\nhas dominion over the hair of the head, Taurus (al-thawr) over the forehead,\nGemini (al-jawza\u0304\u0002) over the eyes, and so on down to Pisces\u2019 (al-h.u\u0304t) dominion\nover the legs and feet. Each sign of the zodiac, he explains, is linked to an\nelement (fire, air, water, earth) that is a combination of two elemental qualities. Thus all seven of the \u201ccorporeal\u201d letters assigned to each of those qualities also correspond to the zodiacal sign they constitute, with the result that\nfourteen letters are attached to each sign.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Al-Buni&#x27;s <strong>reinterpretation of astrology</strong> introduces a mystical and esoteric framework that integrates traditional astrological elements with Sufi piety and lettrism. Key aspects of this reinterpretation are as follows:

1. <strong>Divine Names as Astral Forces</strong>:
   - Al-Buni recasts the traditional astrological powers attributed to planets and zodiac signs as expressions of the <strong>divine names</strong>. He argues that the planets are not independent actors but merely channels for the divine powers associated with God’s names. This shifts the focus from celestial bodies to the divine forces behind them. Al-Buni states that the planets transmit the powers of the luciform letters, which are directly tied to divine names and are the true sources of cosmic influence [Stars and Saints, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=16).

2. <strong>Human Mediation</strong>:
   - In Al-Buni&#x27;s model, human beings, especially Sufi saints and spiritually attuned practitioners, play a crucial role in mediating astral influences. He departs from conventional astrology, which focuses on the direct influence of celestial bodies, by emphasizing the need for human intermediaries who can channel and purify these divine forces. Saints are seen as conduits for receiving and directing these astral energies into the material world, highlighting the importance of spiritual purity and preparedness [Stars and Saints, page 21](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=21).

3. <strong>Integration of Lettrism</strong>:
   - Al-Buni incorporates <strong>lettrism</strong>—the mystical science of letters—into astrology, aligning the Arabic alphabet and divine names with celestial forces. Each letter corresponds to specific divine attributes, and through their proper understanding and invocation, an adept can harness astral forces. This is seen in his talismanic practices, where he combines astrological timing (e.g., planetary conjunctions) with divine names and letters to create powerful talismans [Stars and Saints, page 22](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=22).

4. <strong>Healing and the Zodiac</strong>:
   - Al-Buni applies this mystical approach to practical matters, such as healing. He links zodiac signs with specific body parts and uses divine names and letters to craft healing talismans. For example, he explains how the sun governs the soul, and the zodiac signs correspond to different parts of the body. By aligning talismans with the correct celestial conditions, practitioners can channel astral influences for therapeutic purposes [Stars and Saints, page 21](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=21).

5. <strong>Secretive and Esoteric</strong>:
   - Al-Buni’s reinterpretation of astrology was meant for a select audience. He embedded these ideas within an esoteric framework, teaching them only to initiates capable of understanding their deeper meanings. This secrecy underscores the complexity and potential controversy of his teachings, especially given that astrology in Islamic thought was often a contested subject [Stars and Saints, page 25](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=25).

In summary, Al-Buni’s reinterpretation of astrology places divine names and spiritual purity at the center of cosmic influence, with human intermediaries playing a key role in mediating astral forces. His synthesis of astrology, lettrism, and Sufi mysticism creates a unique framework where celestial movements are seen as manifestations of divine will, accessible through proper spiritual and mystical practices.</div>

Much like the Hebrew alphabet, the letters of the Arabic alphabet have\nnumerical values traditionally associated with them, sometimes referred to as their\nabjad numerals. There are two commonly used sets of values, the eastern (mashriq\u0131\u0304)\nGardiner \u0002 Stars and Saints\n2 \u2cf1 ba\u0304\u0002, 1 \u2cf1 alif, 30 \u2cf1 la\u0304m, 60 \u2cf1 .sa\u0304d, 80 \u2cf1 fa\u0304\u0002, 1 \u2cf1 alif, 400 \u2cf1 ta\u0304\u0002.

The latter point is a significant departure from conventional models of astrological causation, in which celestial rays have no\nneed of human mediators. It is quite in keeping, however, with the central\ncosmological importance al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 assigns to Adam and the \u201chuman cosmos\u201d\n(al-\u0003a\u0304lam al-insa\u0304n\u0131\u0304), whereby, as he discusses in \u0003Alam al-huda\u0304, humans are the\nonly created beings capable of fully bridging the highest and lowest planes of\nexistence.61 And it is in further keeping with a Sufi ethos in which reigned\nthe notion that the very existence of the world was sustained by a concealed]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=23\nPages: 23\nsignet-ring during that time and wears it while in a state of ritual purity, fasting, and\ncontinuous internal quietude (s.afa\u0304\u0002 al-ba\u0304t.in), God will make lasting for him the state\nof grace he is in, and support him in every external undertaking.

Were it not for these luciform letters, God\n(Most High) would not be known, and the created beings would not be disposed\nupon the planes of unity.50\nThe most obvious solution to the numerical code is through abjad, the Arabic\nsystem of assigning numerical values to the letter. Applying the abjad values\nused in the Islamic West (a preference al-Bu\u0304n\u0131\u0304 makes clear elsewhere in the\ntext),51 the numbers yield the phrase bi-al-s.ifa\u0304t, \u201cby means of the attributes\u201d;\n50.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>divine names</strong> in *Stars and Saints* play a pivotal role in Al-Buni&#x27;s esoteric cosmology, where they are seen as channels for cosmic and spiritual forces. Here&#x27;s a detailed explanation based on the document:

1. <strong>Divine Names as Cosmic Powers</strong>:
   - Al-Buni associates divine names with the fundamental forces behind the workings of the cosmos. In his reinterpretation of astrology, the planets and celestial bodies are not independent actors but transmit the powers of the divine names. These names, often linked with God’s attributes such as &quot;The Knowing&quot; (*al-‘Alīm*), &quot;The Powerful&quot; (*al-Qadīr*), and &quot;The Merciful&quot; (*al-Rahmān*), are the true forces influencing the material world. For instance, the influence of the planets is considered a manifestation of divine names, which are channeled through celestial bodies [Stars and Saints, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=17).

2. <strong>Human Mediation of Divine Names</strong>:
   - In Al-Buni&#x27;s system, human beings, especially spiritually purified individuals like Sufi saints, are essential intermediaries for the divine names. These mediators are necessary for channeling the divine influence into the earthly realm. The idea is that without human intermediaries, the astral and spiritual forces contained within the divine names cannot fully manifest in the material world. This represents a departure from traditional astrological models, where celestial forces act directly on the earth without the need for human mediation [Stars and Saints, page 20](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=20).

3. <strong>Divine Names in Talismanic Practices</strong>:
   - Al-Buni provides detailed instructions on creating talismans infused with the powers of divine names. For example, talismans inscribed with certain divine names are created under specific astrological conditions to channel divine blessings. A specific operation involving the name &quot;The Permanent&quot; (*al-Dāʾim*) requires the practitioner to maintain spiritual purity and perform certain rituals to activate the power of the divine name [Stars and Saints, page 24](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=24).

4. <strong>Lettrism and Divine Names</strong>:
   - Al-Buni&#x27;s lettrism—his mystical focus on letters—further integrates the divine names into his cosmological framework. The Arabic alphabet is associated with the divine names and cosmic forces. For instance, the luciform letters, which represent divine light, are seen as embodiments of God&#x27;s names and attributes. The connection between letters and divine names allows for a mystical understanding of how God’s speech pervades the cosmos, manifesting through both letters and names [Stars and Saints, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=16).

5. <strong>Spiritual Exercises and the Divine Names</strong>:
   - Spiritual exercises, such as invoking and meditating on divine names, are central to Al-Buni’s system. These practices are designed to align the practitioner with the divine attributes, allowing them to channel the spiritual and cosmic forces of the divine names. The Sufi concept of <strong>takhalluq</strong> (identification with divine attributes) is emphasized, where the practitioner strives to embody the divine names through spiritual discipline [Stars and Saints, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=17).

In summary, the <strong>divine names</strong> in Al-Buni’s work are more than mere descriptors of God’s attributes. They are active cosmic forces that can be invoked, mediated, and channeled through spiritual practices, playing a critical role in his mystical understanding of the cosmos and astrology.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>In *Stars and Saints*, Al-Buni’s <strong>lettrism</strong> intertwines deeply with the concept of <strong>divine names</strong>, forming a cosmological and mystical framework. Here&#x27;s an elaboration on their connection:

1. <strong>Lettrism and Creation</strong>:
   - Lettrism is the mystical science of letters, where the Arabic alphabet and divine names are viewed as the foundational elements of the cosmos. Al-Buni asserts that the letters, which form the divine names, are the <strong>prima materia</strong> of creation, acting as the building blocks of the manifest world. These letters, through divine speech, are the vehicles by which God&#x27;s creative force operates. This notion reflects the idea that both the cosmos and the Qur’an are coextensive manifestations of God’s word, with letters playing a central role in both [Stars and Saints, page 10](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=10).

2. <strong>Divine Names as Astral and Mystical Powers</strong>:
   - Al-Buni ties the <strong>divine names</strong> directly to cosmic forces. The planets, zodiac signs, and other astrological symbols are not independent entities but rather conduits for the divine names&#x27; powers. In this system, the planets’ movements are seen as reflecting the continuous actions of God&#x27;s names on the earth. The divine names are responsible for sustaining cosmic order and can be invoked in talismanic and mystical practices to harness their power [Stars and Saints, pages 17 and 16](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=17).

3. <strong>Luciform and Spiritual Letters</strong>:
   - Al-Buni introduces the concept of <strong>luciform letters</strong>, which represent divine light, and <strong>spiritual letters</strong>, which correspond to human faculties like hearing and vision. The luciform letters act upon the celestial spheres, with their power derived from the divine names. Meanwhile, spiritual letters are responsible for mediating these divine forces into human consciousness. Through these letters, the practitioner connects with the divine names, channeling their powers into the material realm. This blending of letters, names, and human faculties reveals the deep integration of mystical and cosmological elements in Al-Buni’s system [Stars and Saints, page 19](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=19).

4. <strong>Esoteric Knowledge and Practices</strong>:
   - Lettrism and the divine names are also tied to esoteric practices. Through <strong>takhalluq</strong>, a process where the practitioner attempts to embody divine attributes, they draw on the power of the divine names. These names, when invoked properly through ritualistic and talismanic practices, enable the practitioner to manipulate astral forces. Al-Buni outlines specific practices for creating talismans that incorporate both divine names and letters, emphasizing the need for spiritual purity and alignment with astrological forces [Stars and Saints, page 22](https://myaidrive.com/fuekht9qsbmn5WmyZUGaqR/Stars_and_Sa.pdf?pdfPage=22).

In summary, Al-Buni’s lettrism integrates the <strong>divine names</strong> into a mystical system where letters, names, and astrological forces come together to form the underlying structure of the cosmos. Practitioners, through proper spiritual and esoteric practices, can access and channel these divine forces to influence both their own spiritual development and the material world.

<strong>[INTRODUCTION]</strong>

<strong>[Opening scene with the title card: &quot;Al-Buni&#x27;s Astral Magic and Mysticism: A Deep Dive&quot;]</strong>

<strong>[Narrator begins speaking, soft background music fades in]</strong>

<strong>Narrator (calm and scholarly tone):</strong>
&quot;Welcome to today’s video, where we’ll be delving into the fascinating world of Sufi mysticism, specifically focusing on the 13th-century esoteric thinker Ahmad al-Buni. This discussion will revolve around his influential work in astral magic and the mystical science of letters, often referred to as *lettrism*. If you’re into Islamic mysticism, astrology, or occult sciences, this video will give you an academic summary of al-Buni’s innovative approach to the cosmos.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 1: Who was Ahmad al-Buni?]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to a simple animation showing a timeline of Al-Buni’s life]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Ahmad al-Buni, a 13th-century Sufi mystic and scholar, is widely known for his work *Latāʾif al-Ishārāt fī al-Ḥurūf al-ʿUlwiyya*, a treatise on the mystical significance of the Arabic letters and their connection to divine powers. He was part of a broader tradition that merged Islamic spirituality with esoteric knowledge, including astrology, alchemy, and the science of letters—known as *ʿilm al-ḥurūf*.&quot;

<strong>[Cut to a shot of ancient manuscripts]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;His work was particularly influential in the development of Islamic occult sciences and is often compared to the Jewish Kabbalah due to its emphasis on divine names and mystical alphabets.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 2: The Cosmology of Al-Buni]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to an animation of celestial bodies orbiting around a mystical map of the cosmos]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;At the heart of al-Buni’s mystical framework is a complex cosmology that connects the movements of celestial bodies—planets, stars, and the zodiac—to divine forces. However, what sets al-Buni apart from other astrologers of his time is how he reinterprets the influence of these celestial forces. For al-Buni, these astral bodies aren’t autonomous entities; they are merely conduits for the transmission of God’s will, expressed through the divine names.&quot;

<strong>[Animation zooms into planets, with each one being linked to a divine name in Arabic]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Each planet, each star, is tied to a divine name. These divine names, which are attributes of God such as &#x27;The Knowing&#x27; (*al-‘Alīm*) or &#x27;The Powerful&#x27; (*al-Qadīr*), are what truly govern the cosmos. The stars and planets are simply vessels for the manifestation of these divine qualities on Earth.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 3: Lettrism and the Divine Names]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to a close-up shot of Arabic letters forming complex patterns]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;One of the most interesting aspects of al-Buni’s thought is his synthesis of astrology with *lettrism*—the mystical science of letters. In this tradition, the Arabic alphabet itself holds immense cosmic power. Each letter corresponds to a divine name, and by understanding the connection between letters and celestial forces, one can manipulate the hidden energies of the universe.&quot;

<strong>[Cut to an animation of a scholar writing Arabic letters while the cosmos shifts around him]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Al-Buni’s lettrism doesn’t just stop at theoretical associations; it has practical applications, especially in the form of talismanic magic. By carefully arranging letters, invoking divine names, and observing celestial alignments, practitioners could channel divine power for healing, protection, or guidance. This practice is deeply intertwined with the Sufi concept of *takhalluq*, where one strives to embody divine attributes through spiritual exercises.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 4: The Role of Human Mediation]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to an image of a Sufi saint meditating, surrounded by celestial bodies and letters]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Now, al-Buni’s cosmology isn’t just about celestial bodies and divine names acting independently. For al-Buni, human beings—particularly spiritually purified Sufi saints—play an essential role in mediating these astral forces. This is a key departure from traditional astrology. In al-Buni’s model, astral forces cannot fully manifest without the intervention of human intermediaries.&quot;

<strong>[Cut to an animation showing a saint acting as a conduit between celestial forces and the Earth]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Sufi saints, through their spiritual purity and rigorous practices like fasting, ritual purity, and meditation, become channels for the astral and divine forces. In this way, they can directly impact the earthly realm by transmitting divine will through celestial influence.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 5: Practical Applications – Talismanic Magic]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to a close-up of a talisman being crafted, with Arabic letters and planetary symbols appearing on it]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Al-Buni’s teachings also include detailed instructions on crafting <strong>talismans</strong>. These are not simply magical objects; they are carefully designed under specific astrological conditions, with the practitioner invoking the correct divine names and inscribing the appropriate Arabic letters. Al-Buni emphasizes that the spiritual state of the practitioner is just as important as the celestial timing for the talisman to be effective.&quot;

<strong>[Cut to an animation of a talisman radiating light and energy]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;For instance, a talisman crafted under the influence of Jupiter, with the letter *dāl* and the divine name *al-Dāʾim* (The Permanent), can be used to bring stability and divine favor. These operations are rooted in the intricate balance between spiritual purity, cosmic timing, and divine invocation.&quot;

<strong>[SECTION 6: Conclusion – The Legacy of Al-Buni’s Mysticism]</strong>

<strong>[Cut to a final image of ancient manuscripts alongside celestial charts]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;Al-Buni’s contributions to astral magic and mysticism offer a unique perspective on how medieval Islamic scholars viewed the relationship between the heavens, divine forces, and human beings. His fusion of lettrism and astrology into a cohesive system of divine mediation remains one of the most complex and intriguing areas of Islamic esotericism.&quot;

<strong>[Cut to the narrator on-screen]</strong>

<strong>Narrator:</strong>
&quot;While his ideas were often considered controversial and esoteric, their influence can still be traced in various mystical traditions, both within and outside of the Islamic world. Al-Buni’s work remains a testament to the rich intellectual traditions of Islamic mysticism, where the boundaries between science, magic, and spirituality often overlapped.&quot;
