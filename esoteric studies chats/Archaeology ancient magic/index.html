| Introduction      | Defines key terms like &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;archaeology,&quot; using an &quot;etic&quot; lens that emphasizes rituals and private contexts. Introduces the principle of &quot;weirdness&quot; to differentiate magic from routine life. Frames the methodology of analyzing artifacts, texts, and depositional spaces.                     | Provides a structured framework for studying magic archaeologically, bridging material culture and ritual practice, setting a precedent for interdisciplinary approaches.                                                  | The reliance on external conceptual frameworks (e.g., &quot;weirdness&quot;) introduces interpretive assumptions that may oversimplify the complexity of magic&#x27;s sociocultural roles.                                                                           | Close attention to archaeological contexts allows a fuller understanding of ancient magical rituals, merging material evidence with social functions.                                                                                                 | &quot;Magic emphasizes strangeness distinct from quotidian language, objects, and actions.&quot;                                              | Core theoretical: Malinowski’s concept of &quot;weirdness&quot;; Empirical studies: artifacts from Mediterranean sites; Critiques: Works on ancient religions.                                                                                             |
| Methodology       | Develops a typology of magical materials: inscribed objects, images/figurines, natural substances, and repurposed household items. Stresses evaluating entire archaeological contexts for relational insights between artifacts and rituals.                                                                | Emphasizes the necessity of studying archaeological contexts to better understand ritual functions and broader social implications of magic.                                                                               | Suggests archaeology may inadvertently impose modern classifications (e.g., &quot;magic&quot; vs. &quot;religion&quot;) that ancient practitioners might not have recognized.                                                                                           | Archaeological contexts reveal how magical practices were integrated into local and broader social environments.                                                                                             | &quot;Magical items can provide invaluable information about rituals and their societal reception.&quot;                                     | Foundational: Typological frameworks for artifacts; Empirical: Egyptian magical papyri, Mediterranean inscriptions.                                                                                                                              |
| Case Study: Egypt | Focuses on Karanis artifacts: fever amulet linking pagan and Christian practices, grain-protection rituals, erotic figurines, and painted bones. Highlights site-specific rituals distinct from broader Egyptian traditions.                                         | Expands the understanding of magic in Late Antique Egypt, showing localized variations and unique applications of common practices.                                                                                        | The speculative nature of some interpretations (e.g., protective grain rituals) illustrates challenges in linking artifacts to specific magical functions.                                                                                          | Magic was not monolithic; localized practices reflected unique cultural and religious interactions.                                                                                                             | &quot;Karanis artifacts expand our understanding of magic beyond traditional handbooks and devices.&quot;                                     | Empirical: Artifacts from Karanis; Critiques: Debates on &quot;Christian&quot; characteristics in artifacts.                                                                                                                                                |
| Case Study: Cyprus| Analyzes Amathous curse tablets, identifying influences from Hellenic sources and Egyptian magical papyri. Discusses practitioners blending magical and religious motifs, reflecting professional expertise in local religious settings.                                | Illustrates the interplay between magical practices and local religious institutions, with curse tablets revealing resistance against imperial authority.                                                                   | Raises questions about the autonomy of &quot;magic&quot; when practitioners were often tied to religious institutions, complicating the classification of practices.                                                                                          | Magic in Cyprus involved strategic blending of religious and magical elements, serving both private and communal purposes.                                                                                      | &quot;Amathous curse tablets likely reflect professional practitioners tied to local cultic settings.&quot;                                   | Foundational: Hellenic and Egyptian magical texts; Empirical: Amathous curse tablets; Critiques: Roles of professional practitioners in magic.                                                                                                   |
| Case Study: Spain | Examines Ballesta necropolis curse tablets, uniquely buried with cremated remains. Suggests family participation in rituals directed at local administrators, blending public and private spheres.                                                                | Highlights the socio-political role of magic as covert or semi-public resistance against imperial oppression.                                                                                                             | Challenges the narrative of magic as strictly private by showing family and community involvement in Ballesta rituals.                                                                                                                             | Magic served as a means of resistance, leveraging anonymity and burial contexts for safety while engaging collective action.                                                                                      | &quot;Family involvement in necropolis rituals blurs the line between private and public magical acts.&quot;                                  | Empirical: Ballesta curse tablets; Critiques: Studies on Mediterranean resistance rituals.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Conclusion        | Reflects on the incomplete archaeological record and methodological issues but reiterates the importance of archaeology in understanding magic&#x27;s role in daily life. Highlights magic as both public and private, shaped by itinerant practitioners and textual transmission.                          | Consolidates the argument that archaeological context is indispensable for reconstructing magical practices and their societal impacts.                                                                                   | The incomplete archaeological record limits definitive interpretations and underscores the risks of over-reliance on context-driven methods.                                                                                                      | Magic in the ancient Mediterranean was an integral part of daily life, straddling boundaries of public secrecy and institutional influence.                                                                     | &quot;Magic derived power from partial revelation, blending secrecy with community involvement.&quot;                                        | Foundational: Studies on magic and religion interplay; Empirical: Mediterranean case studies; Critiques: Methodological debates on archaeological interpretations.                                                                               |

| <strong>Object-Specific Analysis</strong>         | Focuses on individual artifacts (e.g., amulets, figurines) to deduce their ritual use, deposition, and cultural significance.                                  | Examines artifacts like the fever amulet, curse tablets, and figurines to reconstruct associated rituals and their sociocultural contexts.                     | Enables precise interpretations of magical practices by contextualizing artifacts within their material and spatial settings.   |
| <strong>Depositional Context</strong>             | Studies the spatial and relational placement of artifacts at archaeological sites.                                                                             | Analyzes placement of curse tablets in graves, wells, or domestic spaces to infer ritual intent and social perceptions of magic.                               | Provides insight into the societal and functional roles of magical practices based on where and how artifacts were deposited.  |
| <strong>Typology of Magical Materials</strong>    | Categorizes magical items into inscribed objects, figurines, natural substances, and repurposed items.                                                        | Establishes clear groupings for artifacts to explore the diversity and creativity in magical practices.                                                        | Helps identify patterns and innovations in magical practices across different regions and cultures.                           |
| <strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>             | Compares artifacts and texts across Mediterranean regions to identify shared traditions and local adaptations.                                                 | Links Amathous curse tablets to Egyptian magical papyri and other Mediterranean texts to trace cultural and ritual transmissions.                              | Highlights interconnectedness of Mediterranean magic and the blending of shared and localized elements.                       |
| <strong>Interdisciplinary Framework</strong>      | Integrates archaeology, textual studies, and anthropology (e.g., Malinowski’s &quot;coefficient of weirdness&quot;).                                                     | Uses anthropological insights to conceptualize magic as distinct from ordinary practices while relying on textual and material evidence for case studies.       | Encourages a holistic understanding of magic, bridging material and theoretical approaches.                                   |
| <strong>Historiographical Reflexivity</strong>    | Reflects on the challenges of applying modern terms like &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;religion&quot; to ancient practices.                                                         | Critiques rigid distinctions between &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;religion,&quot; especially in cases where practitioners operated within religious institutions.                    | Promotes nuanced interpretations, avoiding anachronistic classifications of ancient practices.                               |
| <strong>Textual-Artifact Integration</strong>     | Combines textual evidence (e.g., Egyptian magical papyri) with archaeological artifacts to reconstruct rituals.                                                | Interprets inscriptions on curse tablets and compares them to known magical texts to infer ritual purposes and practitioner expertise.                          | Enhances the depth of analysis by cross-referencing material and written sources.                                             |
| <strong>Socio-Political Contextualization</strong>| Analyzes magical practices within their broader social and political frameworks, such as resistance against authority.                                          | Examines how curse tablets targeted magistrates or imperial figures, framing magic as a subtle form of resistance.                                             | Explores the socio-political implications of magic, beyond its ritualistic or religious dimensions.                           |
| <strong>Global-Local Mapping</strong>             | Positions magical practices within both regional (local) and interconnected (global Mediterranean) frameworks.                                                 | Traces influences between local sites like Karanis and broader Mediterranean traditions to map cultural and ritual exchanges.                                   | Highlights the dual nature of magic as both a localized and shared Mediterranean phenomenon.                                 |
| <strong>Critical Examination of Sources</strong>  | Evaluates the reliability and completeness of archaeological reports and secondary scholarship.                                                                | Notes limitations in excavation documentation and debates interpretations of specific artifacts, such as whether they indicate &quot;Christian&quot; magical practices. | Encourages careful scrutiny of evidence to avoid over-reliance on speculative or incomplete data.                            |
