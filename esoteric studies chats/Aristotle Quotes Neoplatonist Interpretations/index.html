<div class="msg tool"><div class="role tool">Tool</div><strong>Building upon</strong>

I’m expanding the Aristotle quotes table to include prominent Aristotelian, Stoic, and Middle Platonist philosophers, examining their influence on Neoplatonism.

<strong>Expanding the analysis</strong>  
The user aims to broaden the table to encompass quotes from Aristotelian, Stoic, and Middle Platonist philosophers that influenced Neoplatonism, with their Greek terminology, citations, and interpretations by Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus.

<strong>Choosing the approach</strong>

I&#x27;m contemplating how to combine quotes from Aristotle, Stoic, and Middle Platonist philosophers. It seems simpler to use separate tables instead of complicating one table with too many columns.

<strong>Extending the table</strong>

I&#x27;m considering extending the existing table with more entries from Aristotle and also including quotes from Stoic and Middle Platonist philosophers. Alternatively, I could create separate tables for each source philosopher for clarity.

<strong>Crafting a detailed table</strong>

I’m assembling an extensive table with quotes from Aristotle, Stoic, and Middle Platonist philosophers, including interpretations by Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, ensuring clarity and space constraints.</div>
