In the high towers of Altarus, Zorath the Alchemist had discovered the elusive Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. It wasn’t a stone at all—more like a shimmering, fluid essence that shifted between states of matter, promising immortality, limitless wealth, and transcendence beyond the physical plane. But Zorath, being no fool, knew that such power came with costs far beyond human comprehension.

The elite of Altarus had funded Zorath’s research not out of intellectual curiosity, but out of greed. Gold, the lifeblood of their empire, had dried up in the past century. Wars, expansion, exploitation—all had squeezed the land dry. They turned to Zorath to solve their problem, as if alchemy could patch the cracks in the foundation of their empire.

But Zorath’s real discovery was something else, something far more dangerous than wealth. In his final experiment, he had reached beyond the veil of reality, tapping into a swirling vortex in the fabric of space-time—what modern minds might call a black hole.

The black hole, to Zorath, was a tear in the cosmos, an open wound through which the universe bled. It whispered strange truths. It offered freedom. The stone’s shimmering essence fed the black hole, or perhaps the black hole fed the stone—it was hard to tell. Reality had started to blur around the edges.

Zorath stood at the edge of the precipice in his laboratory, staring into the hungry darkness, feeling its pull. He could stop now, turn back, sell the Stone to the elites of Altarus and live forever in luxury. But no, something gnawed at him. His soul ached with questions, and the black hole was a cosmic question mark.

He dove in.

The fall was infinite and instantaneous at once. Time twisted in on itself, and reality collapsed like crumpled paper. Zorath&#x27;s body—if he still had one—stretched and spiraled through the singularity. His mind fragmented into a thousand pieces, each shard reflecting a different truth, a different version of himself. 

At first, it was exhilarating. He saw timelines in which he was a god, reigning over the elite with the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. In others, he was a mere servant, toiling endlessly for scraps of bread. Some realities blinked in and out, mere flickers, where he was nothing at all—a speck of dust in the wind.

Then, it happened.

In one of these fractured realities, Zorath saw a version of himself chained to a massive machine. It was a cold, metallic world, and the air reeked of decay and smog. His alchemy was reduced to a function—a cog in the machine’s endless grind. He was no longer Zorath the Alchemist. He was Z-4381, a worker, bound to extract the same shimmering essence, over and over, for those who controlled the machine.

The black hole shifted, and Zorath understood: the machine was the manifestation of something deeper, something primal. It wasn’t simply a machine—it was a system. And that system had a name.

<strong>Capitalism.</strong>

At first, Zorath laughed at the absurdity. He had believed the elites of Altarus were the true rulers of the world, but they, too, were bound to this system. The machine didn’t serve them—it consumed them, as it consumed everything. Gold, stone, essence, flesh. Everything had a price, and that price was extraction, labor, and endless consumption.

Zorath screamed, but no sound came. The machine consumed even his voice.

Reality twisted again, and Zorath found himself standing in an endless marketplace. Rows upon rows of alchemists like him were selling pieces of themselves. Not just their labor, but their souls, their dreams, their desires. The price tags were everywhere—inked onto their foreheads, stitched into their flesh. 

&quot;Come, Zorath,&quot; a voice whispered from the void. &quot;Come, sell your mind. You’ll never be free of us.&quot;

He turned to see a grotesque figure—an amalgamation of flesh, gold, and machinery. It had no face, only a mouth that endlessly chewed and swallowed, like the black hole he had just fallen through. Its limbs were covered in intricate gears, and veins of molten gold pulsed beneath its skin.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Zorath demanded.

&quot;I am the Market,&quot; it replied, its voice a thousand different tones at once. &quot;I am the system. I am what you sought to escape. But there is no escape, Alchemist.&quot;

The marketplace was endless, and the alchemists around him, once vibrant with creativity, were now hollowed-out husks, their eyes dead but their hands still working. They were creating—no, *producing*—endlessly. Gold, essence, potions, metals—all for the Market.

Zorath felt his chest tighten. This was no reality he could bear. The black hole had shown him truths he had never wanted to know. Capitalism wasn’t just an economic system—it was a cosmic force, a black hole of its own, endlessly consuming and expanding. It wasn’t bound by space or time. It was the reason the elites of Altarus had funded his research, the reason the world had run dry of gold. 

It was the reason he had fallen into the black hole in the first place.

In his final moments of clarity, Zorath realized that even his discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone had been corrupted by the Market. It wasn’t about enlightenment or transcendence anymore. It was about production, efficiency, and commodification. The Stone itself, that pure essence, had become just another product—an item to be sold, traded, and extracted.

&quot;You could have had everything,&quot; the Market whispered, its face drawing closer. &quot;Immortality, wealth, power. But instead, you sought to understand the black hole. Foolish alchemist. The only truth is consumption. The only truth is profit.&quot;

Zorath’s body began to dissolve, his essence sucked into the endless machinery of the system. He was no longer an alchemist, a seeker of truth, a man with dreams. He was data—his existence broken down into raw material, into labor, into profit margins.

His last thought before being consumed was simple, bitter, and cold.

*I was never free.*

The Market watched, silent and omnipotent, as Zorath disappeared into the grinding gears of its infinite machinery. Another soul lost, another resource consumed.

And the black hole, ever hungry, awaited its next victim.</div>
