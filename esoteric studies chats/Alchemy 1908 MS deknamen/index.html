| <strong>Manuscript Analysis</strong>         | Detailed examination of MS Sprenger 1908, including its alchemical dictionary and marginal notes.                                                      | Central to understanding the structure, terminology, and recipes in medieval alchemical texts.            | Manuscript’s lack of clear authorship and inconsistent use of Decknamen create ambiguities.                                                                    |
| <strong>Linguistic Evidence</strong>         | Analysis of synonyms (Decknamen) for substances like gold, mercury, and sulphur, highlighting their symbolic meanings and coded language.               | Provides insight into how medieval alchemists encoded their practices and ideas.                          | Overlapping and ambiguous synonyms require context-sensitive interpretation, complicating text decoding.                                                      |
| <strong>Comparative Manuscripts</strong>     | Comparison with other manuscripts, such as Syriac-Karšuni copies and related Arabic texts.                                                              | Establishes the transmission and variations of alchemical knowledge across regions and traditions.        | Variations in content and presentation among manuscripts complicate identification of common sources and purposes.                                             |
| <strong>Historical Attributions</strong>     | Attribution issues involving pseudo-epigraphy (e.g., falsely ascribed to notable figures like Al-Rāzī and Al-Tuġrā’ī).                                   | Highlights the cultural and historical framing of alchemical texts to enhance their authority.            | Determining authenticity and original authorship is often impossible due to intentional obfuscation.                                                          |
| <strong>Chemical Recipes</strong>            | Examples of recipes, such as for lead and artificial silver, to illustrate practical applications of alchemical theory.                                 | Demonstrates the practical component of alchemy and its reliance on coded language.                       | Interpretation is hindered by metaphorical language and historical differences in chemical knowledge.                                                          |
| <strong>Digital Analysis Proposals</strong>  | Advocacy for creating a digital database to compile and analyze Decknamen and recipes systematically.                                                   | Proposes a solution to study complex terminologies and relationships within alchemical texts.             | Requires interdisciplinary collaboration and technological infrastructure, which are resource-intensive.                                                       |
| <strong>Textual References</strong>          | References to related works like *De aluminibus et salibus* and medieval alchemical traditions recorded in Arabic, Latin, and Syriac sources.           | Anchors the manuscript within the broader corpus of medieval alchemical literature.                       | Some references lack definitive dating or direct connections, limiting their contextual reliability.                                                           |
| <strong>Marginalia Analysis</strong>         | Examination of marginal notes, which include alternate recipes and symbols.                                                                            | Reveals the dynamic and experimental nature of alchemical practice.                                       | Marginalia are often incomplete or damaged, and some notes are disconnected from the main text, challenging their integration into analysis.                    |
| <strong>Symbolic Representations</strong>    | Use of planetary and material symbols to denote substances (e.g., moon for silver, sun for gold).                                                      | Indicates the layered symbolic system used to convey alchemical processes.                                | Symbolic overlaps (e.g., sun representing both gold and sulphur) cause interpretative confusion.                                                                |
