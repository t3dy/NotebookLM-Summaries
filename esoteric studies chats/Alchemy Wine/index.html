| Introduction              | Discusses the role of oil and wine in Byzantine alchemical texts, focusing on technical treatises from the Greek alchemical corpus, dating from the 10th–15th centuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Highlights the integration of daily-use materials (oil, wine) into specialized alchemical practices, revealing cross-utilization in cooking, metallurgy, and medicine.                                                                   | Explores gaps in understanding the influence of socio-economic constraints (e.g., limited olive oil) on alchemical processes.                                         | Oil and wine were adapted for alchemy due to their widespread use in daily life, often modified to meet alchemical needs.               | &quot;The use of oil and wine... highlights the use of these two products in a specialized field such as alchemy.&quot; (p. 249)       | Core: <strong>Berthelot and Ruelle Greek Alchemical Corpus</strong>. Foundational: <strong>Souda Lexicon</strong>, <strong>Zosimos of Panopolis</strong>. Critique: <strong>Pseudo-Democritus</strong>, <strong>Mary the Jewess</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Practical Applications    | Detailed alchemical techniques employing oil for molding, dyeing, and polishing metals, alongside wine lees for gilding. Examples include casting molds, polishing coins, and wine lees for coloring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Unveils practical methodologies used in workshops, showing how oil and wine’s chemical properties supported transmutations and imitations of precious metals.                                       | The vague references to material types (e.g., unspecified oils) limit the clarity of historical recipes.                                                                | The properties of oil and wine were essential for technical processes like molding and dyeing in Byzantine alchemy.                    | &quot;Oil is used mainly as an adjuvant for several alchemical techniques.&quot; (p. 253)                                           | Empirical: <strong>Marc. gr. 299 Manuscript</strong>, <strong>Holkham Manuscript 109</strong>. Technical: <strong>Codex Par. gr. 2327</strong>, <strong>Suidae Lexicon</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Theoretical Context       | Links between Byzantine alchemy and earlier Graeco-Egyptian alchemy, focusing on philosophical ideals like chrysopoeia (&quot;gold-making&quot;). Discusses definitions and socio-political implications of alchemy, such as Diocletian’s ban on alchemical texts to prevent rebellion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Positions Byzantine alchemy within broader historical narratives, tying its technical and theoretical aims to Graeco-Roman and Early Byzantine practices.                                        | Questions remain about how much of alchemical philosophy directly influenced or merely reflected technical practices.                                                  | Byzantine alchemy combined theoretical aspirations (gold-making) with technical skills, reflecting cultural and industrial dynamics.   | &quot;For the Byzantines... the making of silver and gold through alchemy was possible in theory.&quot; (p. 251)                         | Theoretical: <strong>Graeco-Egyptian Traditions</strong>, <strong>Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Books</strong>. Philosophical: <strong>Souda Lexicon</strong>, <strong>Pseudo-Democritus</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Industrial and Social Ties| Examines the relationship between alchemy, Byzantine industry, and daily life. Discusses the use of oil in metalworking, wine lees in gilding, and the socio-economic factors influencing material use (e.g., olive oil scarcity among lower classes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Demonstrates how alchemical techniques influenced Byzantine industry, including metallurgy and coin production, reflecting broader social structures.                                           | The distinction between elite and common material usage limits understanding of alchemical accessibility across classes.                                                | Alchemical practices were deeply embedded in Byzantine industrial and social systems.                                              | &quot;Alchemy’s technical side... had its origins in Graeco-Roman Egypt.&quot; (p. 250)                                               | Historical: <strong>Byzantine Metalworking and Coinage</strong>. Socio-economic: <strong>Book of the Eparch</strong>, <strong>Byzantine Guild Practices</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Symbolic Use of Wine      | Describes the symbolic and practical use of fine wines (e.g., Monemvasian and Aminean varieties) in alchemical recipes. Highlights their selection for symbolic properties like golden hues, which aligned with alchemical goals of transmutation and imitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Illustrates how the symbolic significance of materials (golden hues of fine wines) informed their selection, merging symbolism with technical utility.                                           | Raises the issue of interpretative flexibility in sources where symbolic and practical roles overlap, complicating historical analysis.                                | The symbolic and chemical properties of fine wines played critical roles in Byzantine alchemical practices.                          | &quot;The golden color of fine quality wines also seems to play a decisive role in employing them.&quot; (p. 258)                      | Symbolic: <strong>Monemvasian Wine</strong> (15th c.), <strong>Aminean Wine</strong> (Roman and Byzantine tradition). Textual: <strong>Alphabetical Lexicon of Chrysopoeia</strong>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Conclusion                | Summarizes the interaction between alchemy, industry, and daily practices. Notes the importance of fine-quality oils and wines in alchemy, reflecting their cultural and industrial significance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Reinforces the integration of practical and symbolic material uses, positioning Byzantine alchemy as a multifaceted, socially embedded practice.                                                  | The marginalization of alchemy in historical narratives obscures its mainstream industrial and cultural roles in Byzantium.                                               | Byzantine alchemy was a dynamic interplay of science, craft, and cultural symbolism, integral to its era’s material practices.        | &quot;Alchemy... illustrates the interaction between alchemy, various industrial sectors and everyday practices.&quot; (p. 259)         | Synthesis: <strong>Greek Alchemical Corpus</strong>, <strong>Byzantine Economic History</strong>.

| <strong>Clarity of Argument</strong>   | The argument is clear and well-articulated, focusing on how oil and wine served both symbolic and practical purposes in Byzantine alchemy.                                                                                       | The study connects the chemical properties of these substances to their cultural and industrial roles, such as using wine lees for gilding and oil for metalworking.                                                                               |
| <strong>Use of Evidence</strong>       | Evidence is robust, relying on primary sources (e.g., manuscripts like *Marc. gr. 299*) and secondary scholarship to substantiate claims.                                                                                       | Examples include specific recipes for gilding silver with Monemvasian wine lees and polishing metals with olive oil.                                                                                        |
| <strong>Original Contributions</strong>| The work uniquely explores the interdisciplinary nature of Byzantine alchemy, showing its integration with daily life, industry, and symbolic traditions.                                                                       | It bridges gaps in understanding how alchemical materials overlapped with industrial and domestic uses, emphasizing the socio-economic contexts of their applications.                                                                             |
| <strong>Engagement with Historiography</strong>| The author effectively engages with previous scholarship, such as the works of Halleux and Martelli, to situate Byzantine alchemy within broader historical and cultural frameworks.                                                     | By referencing Graeco-Egyptian and Roman traditions, the study highlights continuity and innovation in alchemical practices while addressing gaps in existing research.                                                                            |
| <strong>Interdisciplinary Scope</strong>| The argument excels in connecting alchemy to diverse fields like metallurgy, medicine, and cooking, showcasing its practical relevance beyond mystical or theoretical contexts.                                                 | The study draws parallels between alchemy and metalworking, such as using oil to polish coins and molds, and references cooking techniques like the bain-marie.                                                                                   |
| <strong>Strength of Theoretical Claims</strong>| The theoretical claims are well-founded, emphasizing the dual symbolic and practical roles of materials like wine and oil, but some claims lack depth regarding the philosophical dimensions of alchemy.                                                   | The symbolic analysis of Monemvasian and Aminean wines is compelling, but a deeper exploration of the philosophical implications of chrysopoeia (&quot;gold-making&quot;) could strengthen the argument.                                                     |
| <strong>Critical Gaps Identified</strong>| The work identifies gaps in the specificity of alchemical texts and the socio-economic accessibility of alchemy, but further analysis of the marginalization of alchemy in historiography could be developed.                                                   | The lack of clarity in material descriptions (e.g., unspecified oils) and limited attention to how alchemy was perceived socially across different strata remain underexplored.                                                                    |
| <strong>Argument Coherence</strong>    | The argument is coherent, with clear links between the technical, symbolic, and socio-cultural aspects of oil and wine in alchemical practices.                                                                                 | Each section builds on the idea that alchemy was not marginal but deeply embedded in Byzantine industry and culture, supported by examples like the use of wine lees for aesthetic and symbolic functions.                                          |
| <strong>Scope and Limitations</strong> | While the scope is ambitious, focusing on both technical and symbolic aspects, it is somewhat constrained by the limited number of primary sources explicitly addressing oil and wine in alchemy.                                 | More extensive references to related practices in other regions or cultures, such as Arabic alchemy or medieval European traditions, could broaden the comparative framework.                                                                      |
| <strong>Overall Contribution</strong>  | The study offers a significant contribution to the understanding of Byzantine alchemy, particularly in its integration of material, industrial, and symbolic dimensions.                                                         | It challenges the marginalization of alchemy in historical narratives, framing it as an essential component of Byzantine socio-industrial systems and material culture.                                                                            |
