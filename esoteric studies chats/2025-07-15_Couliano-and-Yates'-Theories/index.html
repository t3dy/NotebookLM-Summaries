Yates&#x27;s undeniable merit is to have integrated Bruno&#x27;s oeuvre into its <br>
cultural context; for the first time in the history of modern philosophy, Bruno <br>
was not envisaged as the clumsy, grotesque, and &quot;bacchanalian&quot; precursor of <br>
modern thinking but as one of the most impressive representatives of Renais-<br>
sance thought. It is, fundamentally, a question of applying different categories </p><p>Notes to Pages 91-113 236 236 </p><p>and of measuring h im by the standards of another era, and historians of ideas <br>
can never be sufficiently grateful to Yates for having patiently explained the <br>
difference. That does not prevent her f rom labeling as ״Hermeticism״ all sorts of <br>
doctrines of Late Ant iqu i ty of which Hermeticism d id indeed make use but <br>
wh ich d id not have a ״Hermet ic״ origin. The quotations in the text and in the <br>
footnotes conform to the editions of Bruno&#x27;s works mentioned at the beginning <br>
of this footnote. The passage concerning the interrogation of May 30, 1592, is <br>
reproduced by Gentile, I I , p. 211, no. 1. </p><p>33. These biographical data are indisputable. They are to be found in nearly <br>
all the works cited in n. 32 above. </p><p>34. J.-R. Charbonnel, L&#x27;Ethique de Giordano Bruno et le deuxième dialogue du Spac-<br>

it is true that with respect to Peter of Ravenna an absolutely inoffensive practice <br>
is at issue (he believes the image of an old love is particularly suited to being <br>
recorded by the memory, due to its emotional charge).<br>

(iv) Phantasms at Work </p><p>Let us make the acquaintance of phantasms. <br>
Taken literally, the title Hypnerotomachia means a ״ love f ight dur ing </p><p>sleep.״ This leads us to expect that a person dreams of phantasms in-<br>
volved in an erotic f ight, perhaps his o w n erotic phantasm. That is pre-<br>
cisely what happens: two phantasms, that of the dreamer—Pol iphi lus— <br>
and that of the gir l he loves—Polia—are at the center of the scenario. </p><p>The tale is not constructed so as to be easily understood. It is an enigma </p><p>Phantasms at Work 42 </p><p>whose solution is given only at the end. The reader is informed that <br>
Poliphilus seeks Polia, but does not know w h y or how. Of the 311 pages <br>
of the Guegan-Kerver edition, the first part takes up 250 whereas the <br>
second, which provides indispensable explanations, takes up only 60. <br>
The first part tells of the endless roaming of Poliphilus amid the ruins of <br>
antiquity, of tr iumphs, emblems and impresae, each w i th its own secret <br>
meaning. As Yates observed, it could be a matter of mnemotechnics <br>
escaped f״ rom control and degenerated into w i l d imaginings.42״ In any <br>
case, such oneirico-archeologico-mnemotechnics, however fascinating, <br>
w i l l not preoccupy us here. In the end, Poliphilus finds Polia, and the <br>
lovers plead their case before the heavenly tr ibunal of Venus. The sec-<br>
ond part, wh ich contains two monologues, is therefore a tale within a tale, <br>
and the end is destined to complicate the enigma still more: we learn <br>
that everything that happened was only Poliphilus&#x27;s dream, so that the <br>
search for Polia and the appeasement of desire were but adventures in <br>
phantasy.43 </p><p>Neither mystical love nor vulgar love, Poliphilus&#x27;s dream represents <br>
the trite story of phantasmic desire that finds fulf i l lment. </p><p>The tale is saved f rom platitude and indecency by its phantasmic quali-<br>
ty: desire, provoked by a phantasm, is appeased by the phantasm, after <br>
a period of erotico-mnemotechnic tribulations. </p><p>(v) The Depth Psychology of Ficino <br>
D E S C E N T OF T H E SOUL </p><p>Souls descend into the bodies of the Mi lky Way through the <br>
constellation of Cancer, enveloping themselves in a celestial <br>
and luminous veil which they put on to enter terrestrial <br>
bodies. For nature demands that the very pure soul be united <br>
w i th the very impure body only through the intermediary of a <br>
pure veil, which, being less pure than the soul and purer than <br>
the body, is considered by the Platonists to be a very conve-<br>
nient means of uni t ing the soul w i th the terrestrial body. It is <br>
due to that descent that the souls and bodies of the Planets <br>
confirm and reinforce, i n our Souls and our bodies respec-<br>
tively, the seven original gifts bestowed upon us by God. The <br>
same function is performed by the [seven] categories of de-<br>
mons, intermediaries between the celestial gods and men. The <br>
gift of contemplation is strengthened by Saturn by means of <br>
the Saturnian Demons.<br>

For all parties, the prel iminaries of <br>
desire consist i n setting u p a phantasm w i t h i n the subject. For some, <br>
this phantasm w i l l have the capacity to awaken their allayed desire, to <br>
propel and accompany them on their t r ip th rough the intel l igential cos-<br>
mos. This w i l l become a heroic passion ending in an ecstatic fusion of <br>
the hunter and the object of his hunt—accord ing to an image employed <br>
by Ficino and later revived by Giordano Bruno. For others, the phan-<br>
tasm w i l l only point to a painfu l and urgent need for a physical release <br>
which increases in propor t ion as its fu l f i l lment is postponed. </p><p>In this case there w i l l be a fundamental contradict ion between the <br>
medical concept of a phantasmic Eros that disturbs the equi l ibr ium of <br>

Neither mystical love nor vulgar love, Poliphilus&#x27;s dream represents <br>

bodies. For nature demands that the very pure soul be united <br>
w i th the very impure body only through the intermediary of a <br>
pure veil, which, being less pure than the soul and purer than <br>
the body, is considered by the Platonists to be a very conve-<br>
nient means of uni t ing the soul w i th the terrestrial body. It is <br>
due to that descent that the souls and bodies of the Planets <br>
confirm and reinforce, i n our Souls and our bodies respec-<br>
tively, the seven original gifts bestowed upon us by God. The <br>
same function is performed by the [seven] categories of de-<br>
mons, intermediaries between the celestial gods and men. The <br>
gift of contemplation is strengthened by Saturn by means of <br>
the Saturnian Demons. The power of the government and <br>

the soul and the human body through the intermediacy of demons, this <br>
passage f rom Ficino is inspired by the Commentary on the Dream of Scipio <br>
by the Latin Neoplatonist Macrobius, who must have had as his source a <br>
treatise by Porphyry.4 4 Macrobius׳s work had been circulated in the <br>
Middle Ages, and it is possible that Ficino was acquainted w i th a com-<br>

 ,Ordine e disordine delle sfere&quot;). Ficino does not hold this position invariably״<br>
since in his commentary on Plotinus&#x27;s Enneads (II, 6) we find this passage, akin <br>
to Proclus, Macrobius and Servius: Ex eorum iterum animabus in nostris animis a <br>
Saturno contemplatio cautioque et conservatio diligens augetur, ab Jove civilis et prudens <br>
potissimum gubernatio, a Marte magnanimitas malorum iniuriarumque expultrix, a <br>

estatis cura pudorque et gloriae studium verioris, a Luna denique rerum vitae necessariam <br>
cura et providentia diligens (Opera, II, p. 1619). The neo-Plotinian term ״vehicle״ <br>
does not appear here, nor do the planetary demons who appear in the text of the <br>
Commentary to the Symposium. It is very characteristic that, in the eighteenth book <br>
of his Theologia platónica, Ficino says he does not believe in the doctrine of the <br>
soul&#x27;s passage through the spheres, which he calls ״a phantasy of the Pla-<br>
tonists.״ Since he sets it forth in his commentaries on Enneads and Symposium, <br>
however, it is very likely he does subscribe to this theory. Stranger yet, he does <br>
not even mention it where it deserves a place of honor, that is, in the book De <br>
vita coelitus comparanda. Actually, no theoretical justification for astrological mag-<br>
ic is as simple as the idea that, in the course of its descent, the soul is enveloped <br>
in astral tunics that respond to the momentary influences of the planets.<br>

real truths, which are engraved in the soul in order that discursive rea-<br>
soning—an objective though impotent process—may have the means to <br>
grasp and monopolize them. </p><p>Ficino&#x27;s hieroglyphics, which we shall take up later, are symbols of in-<br>
telligential awareness. But Ficino&#x27;s successors go much farther: they <br>
even assert that the rules of the phantasmic language that translates <br>
intelligential relationships can be represented in the form of theater, to be <br>
meditated upon and learned by anyone who so wishes. The idea of the-<br>
ater came from the Friulan Giulio Camillo Delminio, born around 1480, <br>
who spared no pains to see it realized. A professor at Bologna, Giulio <br>
Camillo was not a charlatan. He managed to interest Francis I in his <br>
theater and, subsidized by the king, settled in Paris in 1530. In 1532 he <br>
was in Venice where Viglius Zuichemus, who corresponded with Eras-<br>
mus, came to see him. His letter to Erasmus mockingly describes the <br>
theater of our artist with the heavenly memory, which the humanist of <br>
Rotterdam could neither appreciate nor understand. The year 1534 <br>
found Giulio Camillo again in Paris but never able to perfect his con-<br>
struction, a wooden structure which, according to a letter of Gilbert <br>
Cousin, Erasmus&#x27;s secretary, was still at the French court in 1558. Mean-<br>
while, he was invited in 1543 to the court of Alfonso Davalas, marquis of <br>
Vastos, the Spanish governor of Milan. Giulio Camillo lived just long <br>
enough to arrive there, for he died in 1544.15 </p><p>Giulio Camillo, a modest and unassuming man whose Latin made <br>
him the butt of Zuichemus&#x27;s jokes, left us few writings. He worked on <br>
rhetoric and translated Le Idee, overo Forme della Oratione, attributed to <br>
Hermogenes of Tarsus,16 but it seems he had also studied the work of <br>
Pico della Mirandola17 and perhaps also that of the Venetian Brother <br>
Francesco Giorgi,18 which is based on Ficino. His main preoccupation <br>
was adequately to depict a cosmic model. This cosmic model certainly <br>
stems from Florentine Platonism. </p><p>Camillo set forth his schema in an obscure little treatise published in <br>
Florence in 1550, L&#x27;ldea del Teatro. His construction, which had the form <br>
of an amphitheater of seven sections, aspired to be an imago mundi in <br>
which all ideas and objects might find their appropriate place by virtue <br>
of their planetary classification. Like any artificial system, this was <br>
doomed to be no longer understood as soon as the sets linking terrestrial <br>
phenomena to corresponding planets fell into disuse. We shall see later <br>
that they were constructed according to correlations between a planet <br>
and certain animals, plants and stones and were transmitted by tradition <br>
with inevitable changes from the very beginnings of Hellenistic astrolo-<br>
gy. For the Renaissance mind there existed still a kind of internal evi-</p><p>Phantasms at Work 36 </p><p>dence inherent in the fact that the lion, gold, and the heliotrope be-<br>
longed to the solar set, but this was only evidence of a cultural kind, <br>
becoming invalid as soon as astrology began to lose credibility. Giulio <br>
Camillo&#x27;s schema, as Frances Yates discerned,19 was magical.<br>

longed to the solar set, but this was only evidence of a cultural kind, <br>
becoming invalid as soon as astrology began to lose credibility. Giulio <br>
Camillo&#x27;s schema, as Frances Yates discerned,19 was magical. He was <br>
inspired less by Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s speculations20 than by Ficino&#x27;s <br>
treatise De vita coelitus comparanda (see below, chap. 4, sec. 3). The sub-<br>
ject matter symbolized by the dramatic figures also came from Florentine <br>
Platonism. For example, the idea of the incorporation of the soul was <br>
represented by the image of Pasiphae and the Bull on the door of the <br>
fifth level. Pasiphae symbolized the soul attracted by the body (the Bull), <br>
a theme associated with black magic, goeteia,21 by Plotinus and also by <br>
the Church Fathers. In its descent among the planetary spheres, the soul <br>
was supposed to invest itself with an aerial quality (the pneuma) ena-<br>
bling it to become incarnated in the material body.22 We can readily <br>
understand that working out all the details of that plan, including not <br>
only images but also cryptic formulas, was too much for one man. Once <br>
he vanished, no one else could take his place to continue his work. At <br>
bottom, Giulio Camillo&#x27;s ambition amounted to no less than to forge a <br>
figura universi,23 a cosmic form ex qua tamen beneficium ab universo sperare <br>
videntur, through which it was hoped some profit might be obtained <br>
from the universe. </p><p>Ficino himself, who describes in detail the realization of an universi <br>
figura, was not one of those who, like Giulio Camillo, cultivated the art <br>
of oratory. This is probably why it never occurred to him that the imago <br>
mundi could have the aspect of a theater. For him, the phantasmic ex-<br>
pression of the intelligential world did not assume forms as concrete as <br>
Camillo&#x27;s dolls. On the contrary, it ought to be something mysterious, <br>
unreachable by the profane. </p><p>Egyptian hieroglyphics fulfilled those requirements wonderfully. In <br>
the first place, they had the prestige of tradition: Plato himself had spo-<br>
ken of them (Phaedo, 274c-75b) and Plotinus too, in his Enneads (5.8): </p><p>The Egyptian priests, in symbolizing divine mysteries, did <br>
not use small characters but whole forms of plants, trees, and <br>
animals, for it is clear that God&#x27;s system of knowledge of <br>
things does not take the form of multiple fancies [excogitatio-<br>
nem multiplicem] about the thing but sees the thing itself in its <br>
simple, stable essence.24 </p><p>Ficino does not end his commentary on Plotinus with this; he continues <br>
with a reference—arbitrary, moreover—to one of the hieroglyphics of <br>
Horapollon.25 </p><p>37 Empirical Psychology and the Deep Psychology of Eros </p><p>The treatise, Hieroglyphica, attributed to Horapol lon and ״translated״ <br>
into Greek by an unknown writer called Phil ip, was an attraction in Flor-<br>
ence of rather recent appearance. The codex had been discovered by <br>
Cristoforo Buondelmonti on the island of Andros and taken to Florence.<br>

Giulio Camillo, a modest and unassuming man whose Latin made <br>
him the butt of Zuichemus&#x27;s jokes, left us few writings. He worked on <br>
rhetoric and translated Le Idee, overo Forme della Oratione, attributed to <br>
Hermogenes of Tarsus,16 but it seems he had also studied the work of <br>
Pico della Mirandola17 and perhaps also that of the Venetian Brother <br>
Francesco Giorgi,18 which is based on Ficino. His main preoccupation <br>
was adequately to depict a cosmic model. This cosmic model certainly <br>
stems from Florentine Platonism. </p><p>Camillo set forth his schema in an obscure little treatise published in <br>
Florence in 1550, L&#x27;ldea del Teatro. His construction, which had the form <br>
of an amphitheater of seven sections, aspired to be an imago mundi in <br>
which all ideas and objects might find their appropriate place by virtue <br>
of their planetary classification. Like any artificial system, this was <br>
doomed to be no longer understood as soon as the sets linking terrestrial <br>
phenomena to corresponding planets fell into disuse. We shall see later <br>
that they were constructed according to correlations between a planet <br>
and certain animals, plants and stones and were transmitted by tradition <br>
with inevitable changes from the very beginnings of Hellenistic astrolo-<br>
gy. For the Renaissance mind there existed still a kind of internal evi-</p><p>Phantasms at Work 36 </p><p>dence inherent in the fact that the lion, gold, and the heliotrope be-<br>
longed to the solar set, but this was only evidence of a cultural kind, <br>
becoming invalid as soon as astrology began to lose credibility. Giulio <br>
Camillo&#x27;s schema, as Frances Yates discerned,19 was magical. He was <br>
inspired less by Pico della Mirandola&#x27;s speculations20 than by Ficino&#x27;s <br>
treatise De vita coelitus comparanda (see below, chap. 4, sec. 3). The sub-<br>
ject matter symbolized by the dramatic figures also came from Florentine <br>
Platonism. For example, the idea of the incorporation of the soul was <br>
represented by the image of Pasiphae and the Bull on the door of the <br>
fifth level. Pasiphae symbolized the soul attracted by the body (the Bull), <br>
a theme associated with black magic, goeteia,21 by Plotinus and also by <br>
the Church Fathers. In its descent among the planetary spheres, the soul <br>
was supposed to invest itself with an aerial quality (the pneuma) ena-<br>
bling it to become incarnated in the material body.22 We can readily <br>
understand that working out all the details of that plan, including not <br>
only images but also cryptic formulas, was too much for one man. Once <br>
he vanished, no one else could take his place to continue his work. At <br>
bottom, Giulio Camillo&#x27;s ambition amounted to no less than to forge a <br>
figura universi,23 a cosmic form ex qua tamen beneficium ab universo sperare <br>
videntur, through which it was hoped some profit might be obtained <br>
from the universe.<br>

(ii) The Art of Memory </p><p>The Ar t of Memory, also a phantasmic process whose principles and <br>
history Paolo Rossi and Frances Yates have dealt w i th in their excellent <br>
books, forms an intermediary l ink between Eros and magic. It concerns <br>
us here only to the extent that, wi thout a general idea of it, we would be <br>
at a loss to understand the ideological scope of Ficino and other theoreti-<br>
cians of phantasmic love such as Francesco Colonna and Giordano <br>
Bruno.8 </p><p>The Ar t of Memory is a technique for the manipulat ion of phantasms, <br>
which rests on the Aristotelian principle of the absolute precedence of <br>
the phantasm over speech and of the phantasmic essence of the intellect <br>
(see above, chap. 1, sec. 1). The precise inference drawn from it, ex-</p><p>33 Empirical Psychology and the Deep Psychology of Eros </p><p>pounded by St. Thomas in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s De memoria et <br>
reminiscentia, is that whatever is seen, thanks to its intrinsic quality of <br>
image, is easy to remember, whereas abstract concepts or linguistic se-<br>
quences require some phantasmic support or other to charge the memo-<br>
ry.9 This is why St. Thomas recommends recourse to the mnemotechni-<br>
cal rules contained in Ad Herennium, wrongly attributed to Cicero and <br>
also called Rhetorica secunda. </p><p>It is certain that the Art of Memory had been utilized in the Middle <br>
Ages in cloisters to foster teaching of abstract concepts but also as a very <br>
important element of the monk&#x27;s inner discipline. In the fourteenth cen-<br>
tury, two treatises in Vulgar Italian deal with it, and even Petrarch was <br>
acquainted with its rules.10 </p><p>But times change, and, with the discovery in 1416 of Quintilian&#x27;s In-<br>
stitute oratoria (which, by the way, does not endorse mnemotechnics), <br>
the humanists place the arts and virtues of the ancients on a pedestal. <br>
Whereas the Middle Ages utilized the pseudo-Ciceronian treatise ad <br>
maiorem gloriam Dei, the better to bring to mind the majestic structure of <br>
theological concepts, humanism sees in the Ars memoriae an important <br>
weapon for social success, to ensure, by means of an infallible memory, <br>
advantage over others.11 It is along these lines that the jurist Peter of <br>
Ravenna&#x27;s treatise Phoenix, sive artificiosa memoria (Venice, 1491) was <br>
written. </p><p>The reader of Rossi&#x27;s or Yates&#x27;s books doubtless recalls the function of <br>
Art, which we shall try to reconstruct freely here without going into <br>
detail. Owing to the fact that perceptions have an intrinsically phan-<br>
tasmic character, and are thus readily committed to memory, the task is <br>
to superimpose any contents linguistic or conceptual—for instance a <br>
poem or classification of virtues—onto a succession of images. Now, <br>
those images can come from some place, but this does not prevent them <br>
from being, as well, phantasms produced for the circumstances by the <br>
imaginative faculty. In the first instance, the place must be chosen with <br>
care: truly, this Art demands a total concentration only possible in soli-<br>
tude. It follows that mnemonic activity can only be pursued in a church, <br>
a cemetery, a deserted palace, or at home, avoiding all company and <br>
diversion. The parts of the place must be memorized in a certain order.<br>

    <p>Ioan P. Couliano engages with <strong>Frances Yates&#x27;s theories</strong> mainly in relation to her work on memory, Renaissance magic, and her interpretations of figures like Giordano Bruno and Giulio Camillo. He acknowledges Yates&#x27;s &quot;undeniable merit&quot; in placing thinkers like Bruno within their intellectual contexts, rehabilitating them from caricature as merely eccentric precursors of modernity【8:2†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】. However, Couliano is critical of her tendency to lump diverse Late Antique doctrines under the umbrella of &quot;Hermeticism&quot; indiscriminately【8:2†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】.</p><p>Couliano also comments on <strong>Yates’s interpretation of Giulio Camillo</strong>, noting her insight that Camillo’s memory theater was &quot;magical&quot; rather than purely mnemonic. Couliano nuances this by tracing Camillo’s system more directly to <strong>Ficino&#x27;s</strong> influence rather than Pico&#x27;s, emphasizing its Florentine Platonic roots【8:11†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】. He also agrees with Yates that Camillo&#x27;s endeavor to create an imago mundi through a theater of memory was inherently unstable once the cultural connections to astrology and planetary correspondences faded【8:11†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】.</p><p>On <strong>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</strong>, Couliano presents it as a unique literary case of &quot;phantasmic Eros.&quot; He distinguishes Colonna&#x27;s work from the Ficinian tradition, emphasizing its independence from Ficino’s influence despite its alignment with broader Renaissance concerns about images, desire, and allegory【8:1†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】. Couliano reads the <em>Hypnerotomachia</em> as a narrative about phantasms that blends allegory and empirical psychology—a story where erotic desire is both provoked and satisfied by phantasmic images. He finds its labyrinthine structure notable, with a first part dense with allegorical imagery and a second part that explains the dreamlike plot, underscoring its exploration of the interplay between erotic desire and memory【8:3†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】.</p><p>Finally, Couliano echoes <strong>Yates&#x27;s suggestion</strong> that the imagery in the <em>Hypnerotomachia</em> might be a case of mnemonic technique spun out into fantastical elaboration, though he distances his own analysis from dwelling on that dimension【8:3†Ioan P. Couliano Eros and Magic in the Renaissance Chicago Original Paperback.pdf】.</p>

(iv) Phantasms at Work </p><p>Let us make the acquaintance of phantasms. <br>
Taken literally, the title Hypnerotomachia means a ״ love f ight dur ing </p><p>sleep.״ This leads us to expect that a person dreams of phantasms in-<br>
volved in an erotic f ight, perhaps his o w n erotic phantasm. That is pre-<br>
cisely what happens: two phantasms, that of the dreamer—Pol iphi lus— <br>
and that of the gir l he loves—Polia—are at the center of the scenario. </p><p>The tale is not constructed so as to be easily understood. It is an enigma </p><p>Phantasms at Work 42 </p><p>whose solution is given only at the end. The reader is informed that <br>
Poliphilus seeks Polia, but does not know w h y or how. Of the 311 pages <br>
of the Guegan-Kerver edition, the first part takes up 250 whereas the <br>
second, which provides indispensable explanations, takes up only 60. <br>
The first part tells of the endless roaming of Poliphilus amid the ruins of <br>
antiquity, of tr iumphs, emblems and impresae, each w i th its own secret <br>
meaning. As Yates observed, it could be a matter of mnemotechnics <br>
escaped f״ rom control and degenerated into w i l d imaginings.42״ In any <br>
case, such oneirico-archeologico-mnemotechnics, however fascinating, <br>
w i l l not preoccupy us here. In the end, Poliphilus finds Polia, and the <br>
lovers plead their case before the heavenly tr ibunal of Venus. The sec-<br>
ond part, wh ich contains two monologues, is therefore a tale within a tale, <br>
and the end is destined to complicate the enigma still more: we learn <br>
that everything that happened was only Poliphilus&#x27;s dream, so that the <br>
search for Polia and the appeasement of desire were but adventures in <br>
phantasy.43 </p><p>Neither mystical love nor vulgar love, Poliphilus&#x27;s dream represents <br>
the trite story of phantasmic desire that finds fulf i l lment. </p><p>The tale is saved f rom platitude and indecency by its phantasmic quali-<br>
ty: desire, provoked by a phantasm, is appeased by the phantasm, after <br>
a period of erotico-mnemotechnic tribulations. </p><p>(v) The Depth Psychology of Ficino <br>
D E S C E N T OF T H E SOUL </p><p>Souls descend into the bodies of the Mi lky Way through the <br>
constellation of Cancer, enveloping themselves in a celestial <br>
and luminous veil which they put on to enter terrestrial <br>
bodies. For nature demands that the very pure soul be united <br>
w i th the very impure body only through the intermediary of a <br>
pure veil, which, being less pure than the soul and purer than <br>
the body, is considered by the Platonists to be a very conve-<br>
nient means of uni t ing the soul w i th the terrestrial body. It is <br>
due to that descent that the souls and bodies of the Planets <br>
confirm and reinforce, i n our Souls and our bodies respec-<br>
tively, the seven original gifts bestowed upon us by God. The <br>
same function is performed by the [seven] categories of de-<br>
mons, intermediaries between the celestial gods and men. The <br>
gift of contemplation is strengthened by Saturn by means of <br>
the Saturnian Demons.<br>

For all parties, the prel iminaries of <br>
desire consist i n setting u p a phantasm w i t h i n the subject. For some, <br>
this phantasm w i l l have the capacity to awaken their allayed desire, to <br>
propel and accompany them on their t r ip th rough the intel l igential cos-<br>

the hunter and the object of his hunt—accord ing to an image employed <br>
by Ficino and later revived by Giordano Bruno. For others, the phan-<br>

treatise by Porphyry.4 4 Macrobius׳s work had been circulated in the <br>
Middle Ages, and it is possible that Ficino was acquainted w i th a com-<br>

review of Flamands book in Aevum, 1979). Two other passages from Ficino&#x27;s <br>
work relate to the doctrine of the descent of the soul among the planetary <br>
spheres and the acquisition of vehicles. In his Theologia platónica (XVIII, 4-5), <br>
Ficino mentions three vehicles of the soul (celestial, aerial, and material), which <br>
seems to refer to Synesius of Cyrene&#x27;s distinction between a vehiculum divinioris <br>
animae, which is ethereal, and a material vehicle, common to animals and to man <br>
(cf. my Magia spirituale, note 103). Proclus also makes this distinction (see my <br>
 ,Ordine e disordine delle sfere&quot;). Ficino does not hold this position invariably״<br>
since in his commentary on Plotinus&#x27;s Enneads (II, 6) we find this passage, akin <br>
to Proclus, Macrobius and Servius: Ex eorum iterum animabus in nostris animis a <br>
Saturno contemplatio cautioque et conservatio diligens augetur, ab Jove civilis et prudens <br>
potissimum gubernatio, a Marte magnanimitas malorum iniuriarumque expultrix, a <br>
Mercurio inquisitio quaelibet et expressio, a Venere charitas et humanitas, a Sole hon-<br>
estatis cura pudorque et gloriae studium verioris, a Luna denique rerum vitae necessariam <br>
cura et providentia diligens (Opera, II, p. 1619). The neo-Plotinian term ״vehicle״ <br>
does not appear here, nor do the planetary demons who appear in the text of the <br>
Commentary to the Symposium. It is very characteristic that, in the eighteenth book <br>
of his Theologia platónica, Ficino says he does not believe in the doctrine of the <br>
soul&#x27;s passage through the spheres, which he calls ״a phantasy of the Pla-<br>
tonists.״ Since he sets it forth in his commentaries on Enneads and Symposium, <br>
however, it is very likely he does subscribe to this theory. Stranger yet, he does <br>
not even mention it where it deserves a place of honor, that is, in the book De <br>
vita coelitus comparanda. Actually, no theoretical justification for astrological mag-<br>
ic is as simple as the idea that, in the course of its descent, the soul is enveloped <br>
in astral tunics that respond to the momentary influences of the planets.<br>

(ii) The Art of Memory </p><p>The Ar t of Memory, also a phantasmic process whose principles and <br>
history Paolo Rossi and Frances Yates have dealt w i th in their excellent <br>
books, forms an intermediary l ink between Eros and magic. It concerns <br>
us here only to the extent that, wi thout a general idea of it, we would be <br>
at a loss to understand the ideological scope of Ficino and other theoreti-<br>
cians of phantasmic love such as Francesco Colonna and Giordano <br>
Bruno.8 </p><p>The Ar t of Memory is a technique for the manipulat ion of phantasms, <br>
which rests on the Aristotelian principle of the absolute precedence of <br>
the phantasm over speech and of the phantasmic essence of the intellect <br>
(see above, chap. 1, sec. 1). The precise inference drawn from it, ex-</p><p>33 Empirical Psychology and the Deep Psychology of Eros </p><p>pounded by St. Thomas in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s De memoria et <br>
reminiscentia, is that whatever is seen, thanks to its intrinsic quality of <br>
image, is easy to remember, whereas abstract concepts or linguistic se-<br>
quences require some phantasmic support or other to charge the memo-<br>
ry.9 This is why St. Thomas recommends recourse to the mnemotechni-<br>
cal rules contained in Ad Herennium, wrongly attributed to Cicero and <br>
also called Rhetorica secunda. </p><p>It is certain that the Art of Memory had been utilized in the Middle <br>
Ages in cloisters to foster teaching of abstract concepts but also as a very <br>
important element of the monk&#x27;s inner discipline. In the fourteenth cen-<br>
tury, two treatises in Vulgar Italian deal with it, and even Petrarch was <br>
acquainted with its rules.10 </p><p>But times change, and, with the discovery in 1416 of Quintilian&#x27;s In-<br>
stitute oratoria (which, by the way, does not endorse mnemotechnics), <br>
the humanists place the arts and virtues of the ancients on a pedestal. <br>
Whereas the Middle Ages utilized the pseudo-Ciceronian treatise ad <br>
maiorem gloriam Dei, the better to bring to mind the majestic structure of <br>
theological concepts, humanism sees in the Ars memoriae an important <br>
weapon for social success, to ensure, by means of an infallible memory, <br>
advantage over others.11 It is along these lines that the jurist Peter of <br>
Ravenna&#x27;s treatise Phoenix, sive artificiosa memoria (Venice, 1491) was <br>
written. </p><p>The reader of Rossi&#x27;s or Yates&#x27;s books doubtless recalls the function of <br>
Art, which we shall try to reconstruct freely here without going into <br>
detail. Owing to the fact that perceptions have an intrinsically phan-<br>
tasmic character, and are thus readily committed to memory, the task is <br>
to superimpose any contents linguistic or conceptual—for instance a <br>
poem or classification of virtues—onto a succession of images. Now, <br>
those images can come from some place, but this does not prevent them <br>
from being, as well, phantasms produced for the circumstances by the <br>
imaginative faculty. In the first instance, the place must be chosen with <br>
care: truly, this Art demands a total concentration only possible in soli-<br>
tude. It follows that mnemonic activity can only be pursued in a church, <br>
a cemetery, a deserted palace, or at home, avoiding all company and <br>
diversion. The parts of the place must be memorized in a certain order.<br>

interpretable as a phantasmic process, a visio spiritalis in the August inian <br>
sense.31 It is, in fact, a need to discover a means of communication be-<br>
tween reason and intellect (the soul), and this means is provided by the <br>
spiritual eye, the mysterious organ that permits us to look upward to-<br>
ward the higher ontological levels.32 </p><p>André Chastel believes that the term hieroglypha, as used by Ficino, <br>
does not refer to a form communicated by the soul to the faculty of <br>
reason through the intermediary of the pneuma. Rather, it is a symbol of <br>
meditation ״keeping the spirit in a state of tension propitious to a k ind <br>
of meditation close to ecstasy, the talisman of the oculus mentis.33״ </p><p>Pseudo-Egyptian hieroglyphics, emblems, and impresae were wonder-<br>
fully suited to the playful spirit of Florentine Platonism, to the myste-<br>
rious and ״myst i fy ing״ quality Ficino believed it had. ״Pythagoras, </p><p>Phantasms at Work 38 </p><p>Socrates, and Plato had the habit of h id ing all divine mysteries behind <br>
the veil of figurative language to protect their wisdom modestly from the <br>
Sophists׳ boastfulness, of joking seriously and playing assiduously, <br>
iocari serio et studiosissime ludere.&quot;34 That famous turn of phrase of <br>
Ficino&#x27;s—translation of a remark by Xenophon concerning the Socratic <br>
method—depicts, at bottom, the quintessence of every phantasmic pro-<br>
cess, whether it be Eros, the Ar t of Memory, magic, or alchemy—the <br>
ludus puerorum, preeminently a game for children. What, indeed, are we <br>
doing in any of the above if not playing with phantasms, trying to keep up <br>
with their game, which the benevolent unconscious sets up for us? Now, <br>
it is not easy to play a game whose rules are not known ahead of time. <br>
We must apply ourselves seriously, assiduously, to try to understand <br>
and learn them so that the disclosures made to us may not remain un-<br>

The ״selective w i l l  of the Italian Renaissance pays a good deal of ״<br>
attention to the often fastidious works of its thirteenth-century precur-<br>
sors in order to f it them into its own system of interpretation. It is not <br>
purely out of kindness that Marsil io Ficino, whose treatise on love was <br>
wr i t ten for use by a descendant of Guido Cavalcanti,25 sets forth in de-<br>
tail some of Cavalcanti׳ s erotic theories. As one of the principal repre-<br>
sentatives of the fedeli d&#x27;amore, Guido Cavalcanti developed an empirical <br>
psychology of Eros that does not differ essentially f rom that of Ficino. </p><p>The case of Pico della Mirandola, which we shall analyze in chapter 3, <br>
is more complicated: it wou ld be called a striking example of the Oedi-<br>
pus complex if that term had not fallen into disuse through repeated <br>
abuse. Stimulated, or rather irritated, by Ficino׳s little masterpiece on <br>
love, Pico abandons all courtesy and tries to refute it in toto. That is why <br>
he attacks Guido Cavalcanti for lacking profundity and holds up as a <br>
model for a love poem a canzona by his own fr iend Girolamo Benivieni <br>
on which he undertakes a commentary. The example of Pico is highly <br>
significant. The young man forgets what elsewhere he reveals he knows <br>
only too well , in particular that a cultural era is not defined by the con-<br>
tent of the ideas it conveys but by its interpretive filter. It demands of <br>
Guido Cavalcanti that which Ficino, more subtle in this respect, would </p><p>13 History of Phantasy </p><p>never have asked: to wit, that he already use the Platonistic interpreta-<br>
tion of the fifteenth century! Benivieni&#x27;s Canzona only differs from a can-<br>
zona by Cavalcanti in that it furnishes directly to Pico della Mirandola the <br>
interpretation he would have made even in the absence of the poem <br>
because it was his own interpretation of Eros in general. The Platonistic <br>
reading of Cavalcanti signified, to Ficino, a hermeneutic bias which also <br>
allowed him to pay tribute to a precursor and to the ancestor of someone <br>
he liked. Now, in rejecting a real object for interpretation—because the <br>
difference between his commentary and the text commentated is only <br>
prosodie, the former being in prose, the latter in verse—Pico peremp-<br>
torily rejects all hermeneutics. For Ficino, Cavalcanti exists to the extent <br>
he said something interpretable; for Pico, he does not exist since he does <br>
not provide something already interpreted as was the case with his friend <br>
Benivieni. As for the rest of it, there is no great fundamental difference <br>
between Ficino&#x27;s and Pico&#x27;s theories, although Pico latter constantly cen-<br>
sures Ficino for the vulgarity of his approach to questions of love.26 </p><p>Whether expressed in a polite or positive way, as by Ficino, or in the <br>
contemptuous and negative manner of Pico, it is certain that the Floren-<br>
tine Renaissance takes chronological precedence over the rediscovery of <br>
the other Renaissance, that of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<br>

Circulating through the same pneumatic passage in which contagion <br>
of the blood is spread are images that, in the mirror of common sense, </p><p>31 Empirical Psychology and the Deep Psychology of Eros </p><p>are changed into phantasms. When Eros is at work, the phantasm of <br>
the loved object leads its own existence, all the more disquieting be-<br>
cause it exerts a k ind of vampir ism on the subject&#x27;s other phantasms <br>
and thoughts. It is a morbid distension of its activity which, in its re-<br>
sults, can be called both concentration and possession: concentration, <br>
because the subject&#x27;s entire inner life is reduced to contemplation of <br>
one phantasm only; possession, because this phantasmic monopoly is <br>
involuntary and its collateral influence over the subject&#x27;s psychosomat-<br>
ic condition is highly deleterious. </p><p>Interestingly, the love object plays a secondary role i n the process of <br>
establishing the phantasm: it is only a pretext, not a real presence. The <br>
true object, omnipresent, of Eros is the phantasm, which has taken per-<br>
manent possession of the spiritual mirror. Now, this phantasm repre-<br>
sents a perceived image that has gone beyond the threshold of conscious-<br>
ness, but the reason it has assumed such obsessional dimensions lies in <br>
the deepest part of the individual unconscious. We do not love another <br>
object, a stranger to ourselves, Ficino thinks (Amore, VI, 6), thus antic-<br>
ipating the analytic psychology of Carl Jung. We are enamored of an <br>
unconscious image. </p><p> ,The lover carves into his soul the model of the beloved. In that way״<br>
the soul of the lover becomes the mirror in which the image of the loved <br>
one is reflected&quot;: Amans amati suofiguram sculpit in animo. Fit itaque aman-<br>
tis animus speculum in quo amati relucet imago (ibid., II, 8). That entails <br>
rather a complicated dialectic of love, in which the object is changed into <br>
the subject ousting the subject who, tormented by the anxiety of pro-<br>
spective annihilation due to being deprived of his state as subject, des-<br>
perately claims the right to a form of existence. </p><p>The phantasm that monopolizes the soul is the image of an object. <br>
Now, since man is soul, and since soul is totally occupied by a phan-<br>
tasm, the phantasm is henceforth the soul. It fol lows that the subject, <br>
bereft of his soul, is no longer a subject: the phantasmic vampire has <br>
devoured it internally. But it also follows that the subject has now <br>
grafted itself onto the phantasm which is the image of the other, of the <br>
beloved. Metaphorically, therefore, it can be said that the subject has <br>
been changed into the object of his love. </p><p>A strange situation wi thout a conclusion if it continues thus: a person <br>
without a soul decays and dies (Ficino&#x27;s subtlety does not go so far as to <br>
imagine what happens to that soul after death; he only avers that the <br>
beloved exists in duplicate and the lover no longer in any form). A solu-<br>
tion does exist, however: that the beloved accept, in his turn, the offer of <br>
love. In this case he w i l l also allow the phantasm of the lover to enter </p><p>Phantasms at Work 32<br>

That sickness is precisely the experience described by Guido Caval-<br>
canti, continuing f rom the moment the visual spirit intercepts the wom-<br>
an&#x27;s image and transmits it to the anterior cell of the brain, seat of the <br>
imaginative faculty, unt i l the moment the feminine phantasm has in-<br>
fested the whole pneuma and spreads f rom now on through the spir-<br>
itual canals of the febrile organism. No one w i l l be astonished that the <br>
poet Giacomo da Lentino should ask this seemingly childish question: <br>
H o w can it be that so large a woman has been able to penetrate my eyes, <br>
which are so small, and then enter my heart and my brain?64 The physi-<br>
cians of antiquity, like Galen, were also fascinated by the same phe-<br>
nomenon: Si ergo ad visum ex re videnda aliquid dirigitur . . . quomodo ilium <br>
angustum foramen intrare poterit?65 Averroes answers the astonishment <br>
(feigned) of both parties: it is not a corporeal impression but a phan־ <br>
tasmic one. Common sense receives the phantasms on this side of the <br>
retina and transmits them to the imaginative faculty.66 </p><p>Dante goes farther in his erotic pneumophantasmology. In sonnet 21 <br>
of his Vita nova, he envisages the Lady as the recipient of spirit overflow-<br>
ing through eyes and mouth, miracolo gentil.67 His experience does not <br>
pine away in an interior pneumatic circle but represents, in a certain <br>
way, a decanting of spirit which takes for granted, albeit involuntari ly, <br>
some reciprocity of desire. Through a k ind of significatio passiva,68 what <br>
was the object of covetous desire is transformed into a subject whence <br>
Love emanates, but emanates wi thout being aware of it. Virginal inno-<br>
cence that only increases the pangs of passion, the exquisite torment of <br>
love&#x27;s faithful. </p><p>23 History of Phantasy </p><p>With his Vita nova, Dante also enters a mysterious realm that our rudi-<br>
ments of medieval psychology are inadequate to explain: dream, vision. </p><p>(iii) The Vehicle of the Soul and Prenatal Experience </p><p>That empirical psychology regarding Eros which w i l l recur in Ficino was <br>
inadequate to satisfy Renaissance demands for depth in thought. The <br>
theory of phantasmic knowing merely represented the last l ink in a huge <br>
body of dogma relating to the pneuma and the soul. </p><p>As we shall see, the connection between Eros and magic is so close <br>
that differentiation between them is a matter of degree. A phantasmic <br>
experience carried out through the spiritual channels w i th which we are <br>
already acquainted, magic makes use of the continuity between the indi-<br>
vidual pneuma and the cosmic one. It is this same universal pneumatic <br>
 ,that justifies the depth psychology of Eros (see below ״combination״<br>
chap. 4, sec. 2). </p><p>Through the doctrine of incorporation of the soul, not only is the con-<br>
t inuity of the pneuma demonstrated but also the cosmic nature of all <br>
spiritual activity. It is of course a rather refined form of speculation on <br>
the relations between microcosm and macrocosm, along w i th a dual pro-<br>
jection that leads to the cosmization of man and to the anthropomorph-<br>
ization of the universe.<br>

is set forth as a systematic distortion or even a seman-<br>
tic inversion of ideas which pass through the interpretive grille of the <br>
era. </p><p>A l l of this means that the crowning wish of the historian of ideas is </p><p>Phantasms at Work 12 </p><p>not, or should not be, to define the ideological contents of a given peri-<br>
od, which are fundamentally recursive in nature, but to glimpse its her-<br>
meneutic filter, its ״selective w i l l ,  which is, at the same time, a will to ״<br>
distort. </p><p>A n ideology can be described; a system of interpretation—the only <br>
one that counts because it alone can show what the originality of one <br>
cultural moment in time relative to every other is capable of—is imper-<br>
ceptible. A n implicit if not a hidden presence but also an objective and <br>
ineluctible one, it is revealed stealthily in all its complexity only to imme-<br>
diately escape the observation of the investigator. In order for h im to <br>
practice the history of ideas, he is called upon to see not only what is <br>
preeminently revealed, the ideas themselves, but precisely that which is <br>
not revealed, the hidden threads that l ink ideas to the invisible wi l l of <br>
the time, their producer. Ideas are seen by everyone; the historian of <br>
ideas is supposed to look in the wings, to contemplate another aspect of <br>
the theater, the stage seen from wi th in. </p><p>It is impossible to observe the Renaissance of the fifteenth century <br>
wi thout having first glanced at the Renaissance of the twelfth.24 Theo-<br>
ries about phantasmic Eros were developed in the course of the latter to <br>
reach their apogee, which soon degenerated into affectation, in the poet-<br>
ry of the Dolce Stil Novo. </p><p>The ״selective w i l l  of the Italian Renaissance pays a good deal of ״<br>
attention to the often fastidious works of its thirteenth-century precur-<br>
sors in order to f it them into its own system of interpretation. It is not <br>
purely out of kindness that Marsil io Ficino, whose treatise on love was <br>
wr i t ten for use by a descendant of Guido Cavalcanti,25 sets forth in de-<br>
tail some of Cavalcanti׳ s erotic theories. As one of the principal repre-<br>
sentatives of the fedeli d&#x27;amore, Guido Cavalcanti developed an empirical <br>
psychology of Eros that does not differ essentially f rom that of Ficino. </p><p>The case of Pico della Mirandola, which we shall analyze in chapter 3, <br>
is more complicated: it wou ld be called a striking example of the Oedi-<br>
pus complex if that term had not fallen into disuse through repeated <br>
abuse. Stimulated, or rather irritated, by Ficino׳s little masterpiece on <br>
love, Pico abandons all courtesy and tries to refute it in toto. That is why <br>
he attacks Guido Cavalcanti for lacking profundity and holds up as a <br>
model for a love poem a canzona by his own fr iend Girolamo Benivieni <br>
on which he undertakes a commentary. The example of Pico is highly <br>
significant. The young man forgets what elsewhere he reveals he knows <br>
only too well , in particular that a cultural era is not defined by the con-<br>
tent of the ideas it conveys but by its interpretive filter. It demands of <br>

This time, the material used by Bruno is made up of phantasmic em-<br>
blems whose prestige also derives f rom the hermetic statues. Are not <br>
those spiritual constructions, in the final analysis, forms used by magic <br>
itself? It is true that their use here comes down to memorizing the stages <br>
of Eros, but is not Eros itself an anagogic force which produces the ec-<br>
static union of the soul w i th God? </p><p>A t first glance, De gl&#x27;heroici furori is a series of sonnets w i th commen-<br>
tary, of the type of Dante&#x27;s Vita nova. Like Pico della Mirandola, f rom <br>
whom he borrowed many of the themes of the Commento, Bruno does <br>
not hesitate to copy certain poems which, according to F. Fiorentino, <br>
belong to Tansillo of Venosa, the main character and Bruno&#x27;s spokes-<br>
man in the dialogue. But most of the sonnets are the creation of the <br>
author himself, whether they be commentaries in verse on the represen-<br>
tations of Eros or poetic expressions of the ״heroic furors.&quot; </p><p>In the Sigillus sigillorum, Bruno had already explained the deep reason <br>
for ut pictura poesis, the equivalence between painting and poetry. Zeuxis <br>
is the painter of internal images in the memory, who excels in phantastica </p><p>66 Phantasms at Work </p><p>virtus, imaginative power. In turn, the poet possesses powers of thought <br>
out of the ordinary whose source is also spiritual. ״ I t follows that philos-<br>
ophers are also painters and poets, poets are painters and philosophers, <br>
and painters are philosophers and poets.53״ Indeed, since intellect is <br>
phantasmic by nature, the philosopher must be able to manage phan-<br>
tasms, to be a great painter of the spirit. D id not Aristotle say that ״to <br>
comprehend means to observe phantasms?54״ The place where phan-<br>
tasms are reflected, as we already know, is the mirror of the pneuma. </p><p>Philosophy, poetry, painting: these are the contents of De gl&#x27;heroici <br>
furori. These three stages of phantasmic speculation are so inextricably <br>
intertwined that it is impossible to separate them wi thout destroying the <br>
uni ty of the subject. Unfortunately, being incapable, since the t r iumph <br>
of rationalism, of understanding the phantasmagoric of the great artists <br>
of Memory, we shall have to make a sharp dichotomy between what is <br>
possible to grasp w i t h our mere logical, historical, and comparative <br>
methods and that which, to avoid being drawn into the revived mne-<br>
monics, we must leave aside after a concise description. </p><p>The f i f th dialogue in part 1 is a course in the Ar t of Memory applied to <br>
intellectual processes, in fifteen chapters. The impresae symbolizing the <br>
stages of love&#x27;s sophistry are explained in sonnets, which, in turn, are <br>
the subject matter of the prose commentary. To give an idea of the pro-<br>
cesses uti l ized by the painter Zeuxis, it is enough to mention the third <br>
mnemonic image appearing on the escutcheon of the ״heroic furor&quot;:<br>
