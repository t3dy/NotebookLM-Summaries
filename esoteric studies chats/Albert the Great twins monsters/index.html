| Introduction          | Explores the philosophical inquiry into the limits of human nature through cases like pygmies, twins, and monsters. Discusses the normative &quot;human&quot; versus deviations, focusing on distinctions in reason and social behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Introduces the concept of human nature&#x27;s boundaries and connects deviations to broader ethical and natural philosophical frameworks.                                                                             | Provokes questions about the rigidity of defining human nature and how deviations challenge these norms.                                                                                                                         | Human nature is presented as a combination of intellect and corporeality, with deviations offering a lens into its complexities.             | &quot;What happens to the human intellect and free will when we speak of all these cases when human nature occurred in a less-than-perfect shape as in women, children, Ethiopians, stupid, twin, or monstrous people?&quot;         | Augustine’s *De civitate Dei*; Aristotle’s *De anima*; Köhler (2008, 1992)                                                                                                                     |
| Pygmies               | Albert describes pygmies as the most human-like of animals, capable of speech and exhibiting human-like traits. However, their reason is deemed &quot;imperfect,&quot; categorizing them below humans. Their language is limited to sensory perceptions, distinguishing them from true human intellect.                                                                                                                                                | Highlights distinctions between humans and animals by categorizing pygmies as having &quot;shadows of reason,&quot; contributing to medieval natural philosophy.                                                            | Questions medieval reliance on hearsay and inherited sources (e.g., Aristotle, Augustine) without empirical evidence, reflecting biases.                                                                                         | Pygmies, though resembling humans, lack the intellectual and societal constructs that define humanity.                                    | &quot;They have ‘something human’ but still they are clearly ‘animals’, even if they are the most perfect among animals and closest to humans.&quot; | Aristotle’s *Historia animalium*; Augustine’s *De civitate Dei*                                                                                                                               |
| Twins                 | Investigates the origins and fates of twins, attributing their conception to naturalistic causes like sperm division. Albert contrasts with Aristotle by proposing twins are born from a single act of intercourse. Examines their differing fates through celestial and natural principles.                                                                                                                                                | Proposes an innovative explanation for twins’ differing fates based on natural philosophy rather than strict determinism.                                                                                       | Examines inconsistencies in Aristotelian interpretations, particularly regarding twins&#x27; morality and their supposed &quot;abnormality.&quot;                                                                                              | The fate of twins illustrates the interaction between natural phenomena and celestial influence, blending determinism and contingency.       | &quot;Fate is a forma media, a middle form between the necessary and the possible.&quot;                                                            | Aristotle’s *De generatione animalium*; Augustine’s works on astral causality                                                                                                                      |
| Monsters              | Monsters are defined as deviations from nature’s intent caused by material impediments. Albert differentiates between natural and unnatural monsters, categorizing twins as natural monsters due to their deviation from the norm of single births.                                                                                                                                                                                     | Provides a taxonomy of monstrosity based on natural impediments and connects it to broader teleological principles in natural philosophy.                                                                         | Raises ethical dilemmas about equating deviations with failures and the inherent bias in labeling nature’s operations as mistakes.                                                                                            | Deviations from natural norms, including twins and deformities, are categorized as failures in nature&#x27;s teleology, revealing biases in medieval thought. | &quot;Monsters are natural occurrences... born despite nature’s good intentions, they are called monsters.&quot;                                      | Aristotle’s *Physica*; Avicenna’s *De animalibus*                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Conclusion: Human Norm | Revisits the central question of human nature by juxtaposing the immaterial intellect with the material body. Highlights the tension in defining humanity in the context of deviations like pygmies and monsters.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Develops a dualistic framework of human nature that accommodates deviations while asserting a normative ideal based on intellect and rationality.                                                                 | Explores the complexity and inconsistency in applying universal definitions of humanity to diverse phenomena.                                                                                                                   | Human nature is both material and immaterial, but its full realization lies in the immaterial intellect.                                 | &quot;Nature always aims at the good... unless it has been hindered from achieving that good end.&quot;                                               | Albert’s *De homine*; Köhler’s analysis on anthropological perspectives                                                                                                                      |

| Pygmies              | Textual descriptions from classical sources (e.g., Aristotle, Augustine), anatomical comparisons, and naturalistic traits.                                                     | - Aristotle’s *Historia animalium* on pygmies&#x27; physical traits and behaviors. &lt;br&gt; - Observations of speech and posture. | Pygmies are interpreted as resembling humans anatomically but lacking true intellect, categorized as &quot;shadow of reason.&quot;                                                | No empirical observation; reliance on secondary sources and interpretations of historical texts, leading to potential bias or misrepresentation of pygmies.                 |
| Twins                | Observational anecdotes, classical philosophical texts, and natural philosophy hypotheses about reproductive processes and fate.                                               | - The story of Jacob and Esau from the Bible.&lt;br&gt; - Reports of multiple births by contemporaneous physicians.&lt;br&gt; - Aristotelian accounts of reproduction.      | Explains twin generation through naturalistic and celestial influences, incorporating both physical processes and astrological frameworks.                               | Lack of empirical reproductive knowledge (e.g., sperm and egg discovery was much later). Conflicts with earlier Aristotelian ideas of morality and &quot;abnormality.&quot;          |
| Monsters             | Teleological analysis of natural irregularities, anecdotal reports, and systematic taxonomy of physical deviations (e.g., conjoined twins, extra limbs).                       | - Case of conjoined twins linked to ruptures of membranes.&lt;br&gt; - Accounts of &quot;monsters&quot; with multiple limbs or heads.    | Interpreted as nature’s failure to achieve its intended design due to material impediments, reinforcing the normative definition of human.                              | Inconsistent criteria for categorization (e.g., twins are &quot;monsters&quot; due to abundance, while pygmies are not). Moral and scientific biases shape conclusions.              |
| Fate of Twins        | Biblical examples, philosophical reasoning, and astrological explanations for differing twin destinies.                                                                         | - Jacob and Esau’s contrasting lives despite shared astrological influences.&lt;br&gt; - Anatomical and celestial influences on twins’ development.                  | Suggests a middle ground between deterministic celestial influence and natural variability, emphasizing contingent and material factors like heart formation.            | Contradictions between theological arguments (e.g., Augustine&#x27;s critique of astrology) and Albert’s integration of celestial determinism within natural philosophy.         |
| General Human Norms  | Philosophical and theological texts discussing teleology, reports from contemporary physicians, and medieval natural philosophy frameworks.                                     | - Aristotelian teleology: &quot;Nature aims at the good.&quot;&lt;br&gt; - Medieval reports of failed pregnancies or malformations.        | Uses these as a basis to define &quot;normal&quot; human nature while analyzing deviations as teleological failures due to material deficiencies.                                  | Subjectivity in defining &quot;normalcy&quot; and human perfection; reliance on anecdotal accounts limits scientific credibility.                                                      |

| <strong>Textual Analysis</strong>             | Examination of classical and medieval texts (e.g., Aristotle, Augustine) to derive philosophical and naturalistic insights.                                          | - Analysis of *Historia animalium* for pygmies’ descriptions.&lt;br&gt; - Augustine’s *De civitate Dei* for theological views on twins.                                               | Provides a basis for medieval understanding of human nature through inherited textual traditions.                                           | Reliance on textual sources risks perpetuating historical biases or inaccuracies without empirical corroboration.                                                 |
| <strong>Teleological Framework</strong>       | Using the idea that nature has purposeful ends and deviations occur when impediments prevent its intended goal.                                                     | - Explains monsters as failures in nature’s intent to create perfection.&lt;br&gt; - Frames twins as deviations due to an abundance of material.                                       | Creates a systematic way to classify human and non-human deviations and understand medieval taxonomy of beings.                           | Overemphasis on intent risks marginalizing complexity in biological and social phenomena, treating deviations as failures rather than variations.                   |
| <strong>Comparative Anatomy</strong>          | Comparison of physiological traits to delineate categories (human, animal, monster).                                                                               | - Contrasts pygmies and humans through traits like speech, posture, and hand use.&lt;br&gt; - Examines monstrous forms like conjoined twins via anatomical descriptions.               | Offers a quasi-scientific approach to classify beings based on observable traits, highlighting the medieval drive for natural classification. | Limited by medieval anatomical knowledge and preconceived notions of human and animal hierarchies.                                                                |
| <strong>Astrological Determinism</strong>     | Investigates celestial influence on terrestrial life, blending astrology with natural philosophy.                                                                  | - Uses astrology to explain twins’ differing fates.&lt;br&gt; - Proposes fate as a &quot;middle form&quot; between necessity (stars) and possibility (material variability).                      | Integrates celestial and natural phenomena into a coherent framework, reflecting medieval cosmological worldviews.                          | Faces challenges reconciling theological critiques of astrology (e.g., Augustine) with its use in explaining natural phenomena.                                   |
| <strong>Theological Interpretation</strong>   | Incorporates biblical narratives and theological doctrine to address philosophical questions of human nature and fate.                                              | - Jacob and Esau used to question astrological determinism.&lt;br&gt; - Links female generation to divine secondary goals when male generation fails.                                  | Highlights the interplay between medieval science and theology in constructing knowledge.                                                  | Tension between deterministic interpretations and theological assertions of free will or divine providence.                                                        |
| <strong>Natural Philosophy</strong>           | Applies Aristotelian principles to explore material causes and categorize phenomena.                                                                               | - Classifies monsters based on material deficiencies.&lt;br&gt; - Frames pygmies as non-human due to the lack of intellectual &quot;form.&quot;                                                 | Demonstrates the medieval effort to reconcile philosophy and observed phenomena within a coherent natural order.                           | Overlooks empirical limitations and assumes teleological explanations are universally applicable.                                                                  |
| <strong>Anecdotal Evidence</strong>           | Use of personal or second-hand accounts, often by contemporary medics, to illustrate natural phenomena and support theoretical claims.                             | - Descriptions of multiple births and malformations provided by medics.&lt;br&gt; - Eyewitness accounts of pygmies’ traits and behaviors.                                             | Enriches the narrative with practical observations, linking theory to real-world cases.                                                    | Anecdotal nature of evidence raises questions of reliability and exaggeration, as no rigorous scientific method was applied.                                      |
| <strong>Aristotelian Hierarchy of Beings</strong> | Adopts Aristotle’s hierarchy, where humans are the most perfect beings, with deviations classified as lower forms or failures.                                       | - Places pygmies as the most advanced non-human animals.&lt;br&gt; - Frames human monsters as imperfect humans due to material defects.                                               | Reflects the influence of classical philosophy in shaping medieval natural philosophy and taxonomy.                                       | Reinforces rigid hierarchical thinking, marginalizing the possibility of diversity within human or natural forms.                                                  |
| <strong>Ethnographic Curiosity</strong>       | Interest in other cultures or beings as a way to understand human nature&#x27;s boundaries and deviations.                                                              | - Pygmies described as liminal beings based on hearsay and ancient accounts.&lt;br&gt; - Examines &quot;exotic&quot; phenomena like twins and monstrous births.                                  | Demonstrates a medieval drive to classify and interpret the unfamiliar as part of natural and human diversity.                              | Often speculative and filtered through Eurocentric or biased medieval perspectives, lacking critical engagement with other cultures.                              |

This account reflects the limited knowledge of distant cultures during Aristotle&#x27;s time and is based on second-hand reports.

<strong>Twins:</strong>

In *Generation of Animals* (Book IV, Chapter 4), Aristotle explores the phenomenon of twinning, attributing it to the division of a single embryo or the presence of multiple embryos resulting from superfoetation:

&gt; &quot;Twins are produced when the matter supplied is sufficient to form two embryos, either because two seeds have been emitted or because the single seed has divided.&quot;

He also notes that twins can result from the fertilization of two ova released simultaneously.

<strong>Monstrous Births:</strong>

In the same chapter, Aristotle discusses monstrous births, considering them deviations from natural processes due to material causes or errors in the generative process:

&gt; &quot;Monstrosities are departures from the type in the direction of deformity; they are due to the generative material not being pure, or to some error on the part of the agent.&quot;

He attributes such anomalies to environmental factors or issues during conception and development.

These discussions illustrate Aristotle&#x27;s approach to understanding natural anomalies, emphasizing material and efficient causes within his biological and philosophical framework. </div>
