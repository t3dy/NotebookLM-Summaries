<h1>Instagram Posts Alchemy Emblems</h1>
<div class="meta">Created: September 20, 2024 11:55 PM &bull; Updated: September 21, 2024 11:46 AM</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>I am going to link you to a book on the alchemical sources of Michael Maier&#x27;s Atalanta Fugiens. Use the scholarship on the emblems in that book to improve my instagram posts about the emblem book. https://myaidrive.com/y2irSJLrXWNK8MmnxXE9Kt/Helena-Maria.pdf  Emblem 1: &quot;The Wind Carried Him in His Belly&quot;
🌬️ Michael Maier&#x27;s Atalanta Fugiens (1617) introduces us to the profound interplay of elements in the alchemical process. Emblem 1 depicts the concept that “if BOREAS can in his own Wind conceive an offspring that can bear this light &amp; live.” This aligns with the Emerald Tablet&#x27;s principle of &quot;as above, so below,&quot; emphasizing the connection between the microcosm and macrocosm.
⚗️ The alchemical embryo, likened to Sulphur, is carried by the “wind,” representing the volatile spirit needed for transformation. Maier explains, &quot;All Mercury is composed of fumes, that is of Water elevating Earth together with itself into an aerial rarity or thinness.&quot;
✨ This emblem sets the stage for understanding the significance of air, water, and earth in alchemy, illustrating the necessity of each element in the creation of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.

Emblem 2: &quot;The Earth is His Nurse&quot;
🌍 In Emblem 2 of Atalanta Fugiens, Maier explores the nurturing role of the Earth in alchemical creation. He states, &quot;the Earth is the Nurse,&quot; highlighting how the element transforms and sustains life. This reflects a key principle in alchemy: nourishment and transformation.
💧 The process of nourishment requires the Earth to alter its essence, enabling it to foster the growth of the alchemical child. As Maier elucidates, &quot;it is not more Artificial than the generation of every Animal.&quot; The Earth converts raw materials into the nourishing substance needed for growth.
👶 This emblem beautifully illustrates how alchemical processes mirror the natural world, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between the elements.

Emblem 3: &quot;Go to the Woman Washing Clothes&quot;
🧺 Emblem 3 highlights the significance of cleansing in the alchemical process. Maier describes how “linen clothes are cleaned by the next Element to it: Namely Water,” symbolizing purification. This act serves as a metaphor for the alchemical work of washing away impurities to reveal the true essence.
🌊 The cyclical process of cleansing embodies various alchemical operations such as calcination and sublimation, where “whatever faeces or Crudities are in it will be purged &amp; taken away by the infusion of its proper Waters.”
☀️ As the Sun’s heat aids in the process, this emblem reinforces the idea that transformation requires both fire and water, key components in alchemical practices.

Emblem 4: &quot;Join the Brother and Sister&quot;
💑 Emblem 4 delves into the concept of union in alchemy. Maier writes about the necessity of bringing together complementary forces, stating, &quot;the Brother is hot &amp; dry, &amp; therefore very Cholerick. The Sister is cold &amp; moist.&quot; This represents the alchemical marriage of opposites, crucial for the creation of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.
🍷 The “Cup of Love” symbolizes the harmonious union that facilitates transformation, emphasizing that “Like may be joined to its Like.” This echoes the concept of balance and unity found in many alchemical traditions.
✨ This emblem illustrates how the blending of different qualities leads to new life and creation, mirroring the natural processes of birth and growth.

Emblem 5: &quot;Put a Toad to the Woman&#x27;s Breast&quot;
🐸 Emblem 5 presents a striking metaphor for nourishment and transformation. Maier writes about the Toad being fed by the woman, which symbolizes the alchemical idea that &quot;the man&#x27;s part is to generate, &amp; govern the wife.&quot; This represents the dual nature of creation in alchemy.
🍶 The Toad, seen as a venomous creature, suggests the potential for transformation through the philosopher&#x27;s work. Maier emphasizes that this Toad is “embellished...with natural Gold,” illustrating how even the seemingly undesirable can hold immense value in the alchemical process.
🧬 This emblem serves as a reminder that transformation often involves confronting and nurturing the parts of ourselves that are less than perfect, leading to new beginnings.
#Nourishment #Transformation #Alchemy #Gold
Emblem 6: &quot;Sow Your Gold in the White Foliate Earth&quot;
🌱 In Emblem 6 of Atalanta Fugiens (1617), Michael Maier instructs us to “Sow Your Gold in the white foliate Earth.” This emblem connects the practices of agriculture and alchemy, illustrating how both fields require careful nurturing and cultivation.
🌾 Maier compares the alchemical process to farming: “Philosophi niveos aurum docuere per agros,” emphasizing the need for a fertile ground to yield results. The “white foliate Earth” symbolizes the prepared substance necessary for transformation, akin to how a farmer enriches the soil for a fruitful harvest.
🧪 This emblem serves as a reminder that both alchemists and farmers must understand the cycles of nature to achieve their goals. Just as the farmer awaits rain and sunshine, the alchemist must provide the right conditions for their work to flourish.

Emblem 7: &quot;A Young Eaglet Attempts to Fly Out of Its Own Nest&quot;
🦅 Emblem 7 presents a powerful metaphor for growth and restraint. Maier writes, “A young eaglet attempts to fly out of its own nest &amp; falls into it again,” highlighting the balance between aspiration and reality.
⚖️ This emblem reflects the alchemical principle that “the supreme creator composed the whole system of this whole world of diverse &amp; contrary natures.” The eaglet symbolizes the alchemical work, striving to ascend while still tethered to its origins.
🌌 In the alchemical tradition, elements must interact harmoniously to produce a new creation, much like the eaglet learning to soar. This process of growth requires patience and understanding of one’s limitations before achieving true transformation.
#Growth #Balance #Alchemy #Transformation

Emblem 8: &quot;Take an Egg and Smite It with a Fiery Sword&quot;
🥚 Emblem 8 showcases the importance of transformation through heat. Maier states, “Take an Egg &amp; smite it with a fiery sword,” representing the alchemical process of generating life from death.
🔥 The egg symbolizes potential, and the “fiery sword” represents the transformative heat necessary for this potential to manifest into something new. Maier notes, “the external heat is the first mover,” illustrating how fire catalyzes the alchemical process.
🐣 Just as the egg yields a living chicken through this transformation, the alchemist must apply heat to their materials to bring forth the desired essence. This emblem beautifully encapsulates the cycle of death and rebirth inherent in the alchemical tradition.

He says among others: \&quot;The\nwind carried him in its belly\u201d. By this he means, as it were: \u201cHe, whose father is the Sun, and whose mother\nis the Moon, will be carried, before he is born, by wind and vapour, just as a \ufb02ying bird is carried by the air\u201d.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/YrnLwuJpoFuccjkM5qWBYY/Helena-Maria.pdf?pdfPage=50\nPages: 50\nother, just as Hermes said: the wind carried him in its belly, because the birth of our son takes place in the air,\nand to be born in the air is to be wisely born ; for he rises from the earth into heaven and descends again to\nthe earth, in order to unite the higher and lower forces\&quot;.\nSOURCE OF THE MOTTO\nTalmla Smczmgdimz, ascribed to the legendary Hermes Trisme- gistus.

The air is its home and it is surrounded by it, because it is nothing else but that\nwhich is carried in the belly of the wind (phrase from the Tabular Smaragdfna and motto of embl.

The picture of emblem X1 is in- spired by the representation of the ablution of Laton\nwith azoch et ignis from the manuscript of the Aurora Consnrgeas (Cod. Vossianus Chemicus no. 29, Univ.\nLibr. Leiden, folio 43 sq). This connection with a very mystic\u2014alchemical manuscript, which originated certainly not later than the I 5th century, points to the fact that Maier \u2014also in view of his interest in the ideals]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/YrnLwuJpoFuccjkM5qWBYY/Helena-Maria.pdf?pdfPage=69\nPages: 69\ngrow in the earth and ripen from lead into gold after thou- Sands Of Years); that is to say: \u201cThe heavenly\nPhoebus (\ufb01re as divine substance) generated a son under the earth, and mercury (the wind of embl. I) handed\nhim over to Vulcan to rear him (the \ufb01re as food for the Stone), and to Chiron, that is to the artisan\nEMBLEM V1 83\n(the alchemist) to form him, just as Ceres put Achilles into the \ufb01re to harden him\u201d (embl. xxxv).\nChiron instructed this son of Phoebus in music and citherplaying. Achilles, however, is nothing but the\nphilosophical subject\u2014for he had a red\u2014haired son Pyrrhus; if it were not for these two the Trojan war\nwould not have been fought, as we have amply shown in our sixth book about the hieroglyphs.1 For this\nreason we have also justifiable dealt with music in this book, in which we speak about the life and heroic\ndeeds of Achilles.\nFor if music did great honour to such a distinguished hero, would it not make this little book more attractive?]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/YrnLwuJpoFuccjkM5qWBYY/Helena-Maria.pdf?pdfPage=139\nPages: 139\ncircularem sibi conformem\&quot;.\nI72 EMBLEM XXI\nrninous and corporeal; however, as something becomes more hidden and out of sight, it is also\nproportionately more spiritual, more perfect and more noble. The smaller circle, however, which exists in a\nhid- den state, acts upon the larger circle and makes the larger one equal to itself\u201d.\nSo the invisible reality affects the visible reality, till the Philo- sophers\u2019 Stone comes into existence, that is to\nsay\u2014to use the terms of the epigram of Maier\u2019s \ufb01rst emblem from the Atalanta Fugr&#x27;ens\u2014till \&quot;The unborn\nchild, which lies hidden in the womb of the North wind, will rise, alive, to the light\u201d. In the discourse of\nemblem I Maier himself connects it with geometry, by which an interaction becomes clear between emblem\nI, based on the Tabula Smeragahhza and the emblem XXI, which is based on the science of geometry, in\norder to disclose the secrets of life and the cosmos in that way.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/YrnLwuJpoFuccjkM5qWBYY/Helena-Maria.pdf?pdfPage=226\nPages: 226,227\nBut from where the Sun sinks into the Sea,\nThe Dog comes, in raging fury:\nThe one bites the other, and the other bites back, in a torturous rage,\n1 East-\u2018West has a. cosmological meaning; the world originated from East to \u2018West; a View arising from a\nSun-cult, as sun and life dawn in the East and set in the \u2018West. (In Old-Egypt, the dead were carried along the\nNile to their tombs on the west side) (sec Plutarch. Isis and Osiris. 353 A or 381 B). In the emblems of the H\norapo\ufb02o the scarab rolls its ball of dung from East to West, in order to give it in this wa_v the shape of the\nworld, which also originated from East to West (see G.

For the intestine of that woman is full of poison. So may there be dug a grave for\nthe Dragon, and may the woman be buried there together with the latter, which is strongly united with that\nwoman, and the more it binds her and winds itself about her, the more its body, mixed with the limbs of the\nwoman, inclines towards death, and it turns entirely into blood. When the philosophers have seen that it has\nchanged into blood, they put it in the Sun, till its softness is consumed and the blood becomes dry. Then the\npoison appears, and what is hidden takes shape\u201d.\nCOMMENTARY\nThis emblem once again represents the union of the opposites.

🌬️ Michael Maier&#x27;s Atalanta Fugiens (1617) introduces us to the profound interplay of elements in the alchemical process. Emblem 1 depicts the concept that “if BOREAS can in his own Wind conceive an offspring that can bear this light &amp; live.” This aligns with the Emerald Tablet&#x27;s principle of &quot;as above, so below,&quot; emphasizing the connection between the microcosm and macrocosm.
⚗️ The alchemical embryo, likened to Sulphur, is carried by the “wind,” representing the volatile spirit needed for transformation. Maier explains, &quot;All Mercury is composed of fumes, that is of Water elevating Earth together with itself into an aerial rarity or thinness.&quot;
✨ This emblem sets the stage for understanding the significance of air, water, and earth in alchemy, illustrating the necessity of each element in the creation of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.

Emblem 4: &quot;Join the Brother and Sister&quot;
💑 Emblem 4 delves into the concept of union in alchemy. Maier writes about the necessity of bringing together complementary forces, stating, &quot;the Brother is hot &amp; dry, &amp; therefore very Cholerick. The Sister is cold &amp; moist.&quot; This represents the alchemical marriage of opposites, crucial for the creation of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone.
🍷 The “Cup of Love” symbolizes the harmonious union that facilitates transformation, emphasizing that “Like may be joined to its Like.” This echoes the concept of balance and unity found in many alchemical traditions.
✨ This emblem illustrates how the blending of different qualities leads to new life and creation, mirroring the natural processes of birth and growth.
#Union #Transformation #Balance #Alchemy

Emblem 5: &quot;Put a Toad to the Woman&#x27;s Breast&quot;
🐸 Emblem 5 presents a striking metaphor for nourishment and transformation. Maier writes about the Toad being fed by the woman, which symbolizes the alchemical idea that &quot;the man&#x27;s part is to generate, &amp; govern the wife.&quot; This represents the dual nature of creation in alchemy.
🍶 The Toad, seen as a venomous creature, suggests the potential for transformation through the philosopher&#x27;s work. Maier emphasizes that this Toad is “embellished...with natural Gold,” illustrating how even the seemingly undesirable can hold immense value in the alchemical process.
🧬 This emblem serves as a reminder that transformation often involves confronting and nurturing the parts of ourselves that are less than perfect, leading to new beginnings.
#Nourishment #Transformation #Alchemy #Gold
Emblem 6: &quot;Sow Your Gold in the White Foliate Earth&quot;
🌱 In Emblem 6 of Atalanta Fugiens (1617), Michael Maier instructs us to “Sow Your Gold in the white foliate Earth.” This emblem connects the practices of agriculture and alchemy, illustrating how both fields require careful nurturing and cultivation.
🌾 Maier compares the alchemical process to farming: “Philosophi niveos aurum docuere per agros,” emphasizing the need for a fertile ground to yield results. The “white foliate Earth” symbolizes the prepared substance necessary for transformation, akin to how a farmer enriches the soil for a fruitful harvest.
🧪 This emblem serves as a reminder that both alchemists and farmers must understand the cycles of nature to achieve their goals. Just as the farmer awaits rain and sunshine, the alchemist must provide the right conditions for their work to flourish.
#Gold #Transformation #Alchemy #Farming

Emblem 7: &quot;A Young Eaglet Attempts to Fly Out of Its Own Nest&quot;
🦅 Emblem 7 presents a powerful metaphor for growth and restraint. Maier writes, “A young eaglet attempts to fly out of its own nest &amp; falls into it again,” highlighting the balance between aspiration and reality.
⚖️ This emblem reflects the alchemical principle that “the supreme creator composed the whole system of this whole world of diverse &amp; contrary natures.” The eaglet symbolizes the alchemical work, striving to ascend while still tethered to its origins.
🌌 In the alchemical tradition, elements must interact harmoniously to produce a new creation, much like the eaglet learning to soar. This process of growth requires patience and understanding of one’s limitations before achieving true transformation.

### Emblem 1: &quot;The Wind Carried Him in His Belly&quot;
🌬️ In *Atalanta Fugiens* (1617), Emblem 1 is inspired by the *Tabula Smaragdina*, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, where the phrase &quot;the wind carried him in its belly&quot; connects air, wind, and the alchemical process. The wind, or volatile spirit, carries Mercury (the soul of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone), allowing Sulphur (the body) to be born through vapor and air. Maier emphasizes that the alchemical embryo is “conceived by the wind” and lifted by “aerial rarity or thinness,” a vital step in the transformation of materials.
⚗️ The embryo, symbolic of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, represents a powerful union between opposites (Sun and Moon, air and earth), showcasing how the alchemist mirrors nature&#x27;s creative cycles. As the wind supports this volatile union, the emblem symbolizes the foundation for creating the Philosopher’s Stone through harmony between the elements. 
✨ This principle embodies the ancient phrase &quot;as above, so below,&quot; linking the microcosm and macrocosm in alchemy.

### Emblem 2: &quot;The Earth is His Nurse&quot;
🌍 Emblem 2 reinforces the nurturing role of Earth in the alchemical cycle. According to Maier, &quot;the Earth is the Nurse,&quot; a metaphor for how the Earth element sustains and transforms alchemical materials. It is through the interaction of Earth with other elements that life and alchemical substances flourish. This nurturing process is likened to that of an animal mother, reflecting natural cycles of nourishment and transformation.
💧 Earth alters its essence to nurture the alchemical child, a process that mirrors how raw materials are purified and prepared for transformation into the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. The Earth, thus, symbolizes the vital nourishing force required for alchemical growth.

### Emblem 3: &quot;Go to the Woman Washing Clothes&quot;
🧺 The process of cleansing, central to Emblem 3, is a metaphor for purification in alchemy. As Maier writes, the woman washes clothes using water, which corresponds to the alchemical process of separating impurities. The washing symbolizes the removal of impurities from raw materials, leaving behind only what is essential for alchemical transformation.
🌊 This purification process is mirrored in alchemical operations such as calcination and sublimation. Water and fire work together to cleanse and refine, echoing the importance of elemental interaction in producing the Philosopher’s Stone.

### Emblem 5: &quot;Put a Toad to the Woman&#x27;s Breast&quot;
🐸 The toad in Emblem 5 symbolizes transformation through the philosopher’s work. Maier writes about the Toad being fed by the woman, representing an alchemical transformation where the seemingly base (the Toad, associated with venom) holds immense potential when nurtured correctly. The Toad, like the base metals in alchemy, can be transmuted into something of great value—&quot;embellished...with natural Gold.”
🧬 This emblem underscores the idea that alchemical processes, much like personal growth, require embracing and transforming imperfections into something valuable.

### Emblem 7: &quot;A Young Eaglet Attempts to Fly Out of Its Own Nest&quot;
🦅 In Emblem 7, the eaglet’s attempt to fly is a metaphor for the alchemical process of growth. Maier draws on the idea that the eaglet, while aspiring to ascend, must still rely on its origins. This emblem mirrors the balance between aspiration and reality, a key theme in alchemy. The eaglet’s struggle symbolizes the alchemical work that strives to ascend to higher realms while remaining connected to its elemental roots.
⚖️ This metaphor reflects the tension between striving for spiritual transformation and recognizing one’s limitations.

🌳 In Emblem 9, Maier explores rejuvenation and the cyclical nature of life. He instructs, “Shut up the Tree with the Old Man in a House of Dew,” emphasizing the idea that renewal comes from nurturing the old.
💧 The “House of Dew” represents a moist environment conducive to growth. Maier states, “the Nutriment of a Tree is moisture,” highlighting the essential role of water in both botany and alchemy.
⚗️ This emblem signifies that through proper care and conditions, even the aged can find rejuvenation, mirroring the alchemical goal of transformation and perfection. The old man, when fed from the tree’s fruit, symbolizes the return to youth and vitality.
#Rejuvenation #Water #Alchemy #Transformation

Emblem 10: &quot;Give Fire to Fire, Mercury to Mercury&quot;
🔥 Emblem 10 encapsulates the essence of alchemical harmony. Maier’s directive, “Give Fire to fire, Mercury to Mercury,” suggests that like must be met with like for effective transformation.
⚗️ This emblem emphasizes the need for complementary elements in the alchemical process: “For every like added to its like, makes it become more like.” This reflects the principle that similar substances enhance each other’s properties during transformation.
🌌 The alchemist is reminded that both Fire and Mercury are essential in creating the Philosopher’s Stone, as they represent both the volatile and fixed aspects of the materials used. This interplay is crucial for achieving the ultimate goal of alchemy.
#Harmony #Transformation #Fire #Mercury #Alchemy
Emblem 11: &quot;Whiten Latona and Tear Your Books&quot;
🌌 In Emblem 11 of Atalanta Fugiens (1617), Michael Maier advises, “Whiten Latona and tear your books.” This emblem speaks to the challenges of understanding alchemical texts and the pursuit of truth.
📚 The discourse emphasizes the obscurity found in many alchemical writings: “Allegorical discourses being in themselves hard to understand are the Cause of many Errors.” Maier suggests that to grasp the deeper truths of nature, one must not only study but also engage in the alchemical process itself.
🌟 Latona, representing an imperfect body of Sol and Luna, must be “sublimed to one more worthy.” This metaphor implies that the alchemist must elevate their understanding through practice and experience, moving beyond superficial interpretations to achieve genuine insight.
#WhitenLatona #Alchemy #Truth #Understanding

Emblem 12: &quot;The Stone Which Saturn Vomited Up&quot;
⚖️ Emblem 12 reveals the dual nature of Saturn as both a planet and a metal. Maier writes about Saturn’s role as the “Discoverer of Truth,” emphasizing the necessity of darkness in the alchemical process: “nothing comes into existence without blackness.”
🌑 The discourse illustrates the transformation from blackness to whiteness, signifying stages in the alchemical work. “Blackness is a dark cloud covering the Stone at first so that it cannot be seen,” indicating the importance of recognizing and embracing the initial chaos in one’s journey.
🗝️ This emblem serves as a reminder that from darkness, light and clarity can emerge. Just as Saturn vomits up the stone, the alchemist must navigate through obscurity to reveal the true nature of their materials.
#Transformation #Saturn #Alchemy #Truth

Emblem 13: &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Brass is Dropsical&quot;
💧 In Emblem 13, Maier connects the process of alchemy to the story of Naaman, who was cured of leprosy by washing in the Jordan River. He writes, “the Philosophers&#x27; Brass, labouring under the disease of a Dropsie, should be freed from it by washings of water.”
🔬 This emblem emphasizes the need for purification and the transformative power of water. The discourse highlights that “the coldness and moisture which is manifest is a Watery Fume, corrupting, blackening, and destroying itself,” indicating that careful treatment is essential to achieving the desired perfection.
🔥 By paralleling alchemical processes to natural remedies, Maier illustrates the depth of knowledge required for successful transformation, reminding us that patience and technique are key in both chemistry and life.

🔗 The dragon represents the philosopher’s stone and the transformative process of sulfur. “This my son is Sulphur, and this the Serpent and Dragon devouring his Tail,” Maier writes, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all substances and the necessity of their transformation.
🌀 The imagery of the dragon consuming its own tail symbolizes the eternal cycle of creation and destruction, reminding the alchemist of the importance of embracing change to achieve mastery over materials.
#Transformation #Dragon #Alchemy #CycleOfLife

Emblem 15: &quot;Let the Work of the Potter, Consisting of Dryness and Moisture, Instruct You&quot;
👩‍🎨 In Emblem 15, Maier draws parallels between alchemy and pottery, stating, “the work of the Potter, consisting of drynesse and moisture, instructs you.” This highlights the essential balance of elements in both crafts.
⚖️ The discourse emphasizes that “if the Earth should be without Water... it would remain unfruitful.” Similarly, the potter mixes clay with water to create a malleable substance, reflecting the alchemist’s need for careful balance in their materials.
🔥 By illustrating the interplay between dryness and moisture, Maier reminds us that true mastery in alchemy involves understanding and harmonizing contrasting elements to produce something greater than the sum of its parts.

Emblem 16: &quot;One Lion Has Wings and the Other Has None&quot;
🦁 In Emblem 16, Michael Maier contrasts the noble lion with its winged counterpart. “One lion hath wings and the other hath none,” symbolizes different aspects of alchemical transformation.
🌟 The discourse highlights the lion’s bravery and unique nature, which embodies the ideal qualities of the alchemical work: “a firm and constant animal void of deceit.” The winged lion represents the potential for ascension and transformation, implying that the alchemist must strive for purity and strength in their practices.
🗝️ The emblem encourages a harmonious union between these two forms, suggesting that the ideal philosopher&#x27;s stone arises from the collaboration of both steadfastness and swiftness in the alchemical journey.

### Emblem 9: &quot;Shut Up the Tree with the Old Man in a House of Dew&quot;
🌳 In Emblem 9, Maier reflects on rejuvenation and the cyclical nature of life. The instruction to “Shut up the Tree with the Old Man in a House of Dew” suggests that the secret to renewal lies in nurturing the old and decayed. The tree represents life, and the “Old Man” symbolizes time-worn wisdom awaiting revitalization.
💧 The “House of Dew” refers to a moist environment essential for growth, much like the dew that nourishes plants. Maier highlights the importance of moisture in the alchemical process, stating that “the Nutriment of a Tree is moisture,” linking this natural metaphor to alchemy’s emphasis on water as a transformative agent.
⚗️ This emblem signifies that even the aged can be rejuvenated through proper care and transformation, symbolizing the alchemical quest for eternal youth and perfection. The Old Man’s rejuvenation parallels the alchemist’s ultimate goal of turning base materials into the Philosopher’s Stone.

### Emblem 10: &quot;Give Fire to Fire, Mercury to Mercury&quot;
🔥 Emblem 10 encapsulates the harmony needed in alchemy. The directive, “Give Fire to fire, Mercury to Mercury,” emphasizes the principle of matching like with like in order to foster transformation. Fire and Mercury represent both the volatile and the fixed aspects of alchemical processes, and their union is necessary for success.
⚗️ Maier’s philosophy is that “every like added to its like, makes it become more like,” indicating that alchemical elements must be paired with their counterparts to strengthen and enhance their transformative properties. This principle is vital for achieving the Philosopher’s Stone, where fire (energy) and Mercury (fluidity) interact to catalyze the process.
🌌 This emblem serves as a reminder of the importance of elemental balance in the alchemical quest.

### Emblem 11: &quot;Whiten Latona and Tear Your Books&quot;
🌌 Emblem 11 challenges the alchemist to transcend mere study and engage with the practical aspects of transformation. “Whiten Latona and tear your books” calls for action rather than intellectual stagnation. Latona, representing an imperfect union of Sol and Luna, must be refined and purified.
📚 Maier critiques the obscurity of alchemical writings, warning that allegories often lead to misunderstanding. To uncover deeper truths, one must not only study but also actively engage in the alchemical process, moving beyond theory to achieve real insight.
🌟 The sublimation of Latona symbolizes the elevation of understanding, urging alchemists to embrace practical experience as the true path to enlightenment.

### Emblem 12: &quot;The Stone Which Saturn Vomited Up&quot;
⚖️ Emblem 12 delves into Saturn’s dual role in alchemy, both as a planet and a symbol of lead. Saturn, often associated with melancholy and decay, is essential in the alchemical process of transformation. Maier emphasizes that “nothing comes into existence without blackness,” alluding to the initial chaotic stage of alchemical work.
🌑 The transition from blackness to whiteness, known as *nigredo*, marks the path to enlightenment. Just as Saturn vomits up the stone, the alchemist must navigate through darkness and confusion before revealing the true nature of their materials.
🗝️ This emblem serves as a reminder that from darkness and chaos, light and clarity will emerge, reinforcing the need to embrace the early stages of the transformative process.

### Emblem 13: &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Brass is Dropsical&quot;
💧 In Emblem 13, Maier draws on the biblical story of Naaman, cured of leprosy by bathing in the Jordan River, to emphasize the necessity of purification in alchemy. The reference to “Philosophers&#x27; Brass” highlights the need to wash away imperfections through careful treatment with water.
🔬 Water represents the solvent that purifies and refines alchemical materials. Maier warns that “coldness and moisture” can corrupt and blacken materials if not treated properly, stressing the importance of patience and care in achieving perfection.
🔥 This emblem illustrates the parallels between alchemy and natural remedies, reminding us that the transformative process requires both knowledge and precision.

### Emblem 14: &quot;This is the Dragon that Devours His Tail&quot;
🐉 Emblem 14 introduces the dragon as a symbol of eternal transformation. Maier explains that “a Serpent that has devoured a Serpent becomes a Dragon,” representing the cyclical nature of alchemy. The dragon, or *ouroboros*, devouring its own tail, symbolizes the constant cycle of creation and destruction.
🔗 The dragon also represents sulfur, a key element in the alchemical process, and the Philosopher’s Stone itself. Maier emphasizes that this emblem underscores the interconnectedness of all substances and the necessity of their transformation.
🌀 The dragon’s cyclical consumption signifies the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth, reminding the alchemist of the transformative potential of embracing change.

### Emblem 15: &quot;Let the Work of the Potter, Consisting of Dryness and Moisture, Instruct You&quot;
👩‍🎨 Emblem 15 draws a powerful analogy between alchemy and pottery. Maier writes, “the work of the Potter, consisting of drynesse and moisture, instructs you,” emphasizing the balance of elements needed for both crafts. In alchemy, as in pottery, the combination of earth (dryness) and water (moisture) is essential for creation.
⚖️ Maier stresses that without water, earth would remain unproductive. Similarly, the potter must mix dry clay with water to mold and create, reflecting the alchemist’s need to balance opposing elements for successful transformation.
🔥 This emblem highlights the importance of understanding and mastering elemental harmony to achieve the Philosopher’s Stone.

🌟 The noble qualities of the lion, such as bravery and loyalty, mirror the attributes an alchemist must cultivate to succeed in their work. The winged lion, however, represents the potential for spiritual growth and transformation, signaling the alchemist’s journey toward enlightenment.
🗝️ This emblem emphasizes the need for balance between these two forms, where grounded strength and soaring ambition must coexist to create the Philosopher’s Stone.

### Emblem 17: &quot;Four Orbs Govern This Work of Fire&quot;
🔥 Emblem 17 introduces the “four sorts of fire” necessary for the alchemical process. Maier draws on the works of alchemists like Lully and Ripley to explain the roles of Natural, Innatural, Against Nature, and Elemental fires. Each type of fire is essential for different stages of transformation.

On its\ncomprehension depends the whole success of the Work\n.One sees there, inside a border formed by two interlacing rosaries, a man\nasleep on a rock whereon grow some languishing kermes - oaks.

And it is already a great\nachievement merely to notice this, without it being necessary to insist more\nupon it. The hermetic expositions will warn the disciple, who does not judge it\nuseless to inform himself about it.\nThe sleeping man is the subject of the Work. What is this subject? Some say\nthat it is a body; others affirm that it is a water. They are both right because a\nwater called {the silver beauty} springs from this body that the Sages call the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=12\nPages: 12,13\nfrom seven to ten from the Sun. They are indicated by the flying of the birds\nand are indispensable, for they prepare the nuptial robe of Apollo and Diana,\nwithout which their mystical union would be impossible.

Some have seen\nin it a kind of magical influx, for them magic is a supernatural power, acquired\nby concourse with spirits, good or bad.

The\nartist&#x27;s prayer is yet more his work, often hard, dangerous and incompatible\nwith too white hands.\nCount then above all on the improbus labor.\nPlate 3\nT\nhe third plate is no longer in its place. It leads us into the empire of\nNeptune. One sees, frolicking in his waves, the dolphin dear to Apollo and on a\nboat some fishermen putting out their gear. In another ship a man lies stretched\nout in a nonchalant position. In the second, a landscape with on one side a ram,\non the other a bull, which we shall find back further on and shall study at a\nmore opportune moment.

Thus these\nphantasists pretend to impregnate the matter with astral spirit as one charges a\nbattery with electricity. This is what the poorly understood and randomly\napplied analogy leads to. We shall not name these singular theoreticians whose\nsincerity is respectable; but we had to signal the fact, in order to put studious\nand too confident disciple on his guard against the hazardous reading of authors\nwithout mandate and without consecration, who have never produced anything\nbut books, but who from that time pass for Masters.\nPlate 10\nT\nhe tenth plate represents the conjunction. The first figure shows, on the\nscales of a balance, on one side the salt indicated by the star, on the other the\nsulphur designated by a flower, which with its heart forms seven petals. These]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20,21\nthe point of repeating it when we were already provided with it? It is not that\nthe author of the Mutus Liber would send us back to the fields to fetch some\nmore; but surely he was obliged to repeat this symbol, the moment that this\ncelestial agent had to enter into a new combination. In one of the figures of this\nplate, we see Mercury in the process of buying a flask of this divine water from\na country woman. He therefore has need for it for some use. Philaletes\nprescribes, effectively, to wash the mercury several times, in such a way as to\nmake it loose some of its oily nature. He very carefully describes this operation\nwhich is accomplished by means of the celestial water brought to a certain\ntemperature, nevertheless moderate, for it takes only a little too much heat for\nthe fiery part to retake its path to the stars. Philaletes is a great master, his word\nhas authority and he presents the work with such ingenuity, that no suspicion of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=13\nPages: 13\nrecognized some virtue. It is up to the disciple to form his own opinion\naccording to his own judgement. But it is beyond doubt that an agent kept\nsecret, called \&quot;Celestial Manna\&quot; plays an important part in the work.\nWe must declare, sincerely, that the Ram and the Bull in the plate, which one\nalways takes for the signs of the zodiac under which one must collect the flos\ncoeli, have no connection with the astrological symbols. The Ram is Hermes&#x27;\nCriophore, which is the same as Jupiter Ammon; and the Bull, whose horns\ndelineate the crescent, attribute of Diana and Isis, who are identical with the\ncow Io, lover of Jupiter, and the philosophers moon. These two animals\npersonify the two natures of the Stone. Their union forms the Azyme of the\nEgyptians, the Asimah of the Bible, hybrid monster designating the orichalc,\nthe Latten or bronze oryx, the bull of Phalaris or of bronze, the golden or\nchrysoeale calf, which differs, most certainly, from the pinchbeck of Mannheim]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=15\nPages: 15\ncarrying a silver moon on a field of gules.\nThe moon of the philosophers is not always silver, though this metal is\nconvenient to the work at a certain point. In order to lead astray the profane, the\nAdepts gave this name to mercury and its salt, the preparation of which\npresents the most grave difficulties. In order that the mercury be suitable to the\nwork, it is indispensable to animate it. This animation is performed by means of\nthe sulphur prepared to this end. In Philaletes one will find the practical\ndirections, which however must not always be followed word for word. He is\nexact, yet he fails to purge the mercury from its heterogeneous elements by\nseparating the pure from the impure, the subtle from the gross. One sees, in this\nplate, the woman who gets ready to skim the compost. It is a presentation\noverburdened with work, but in the main exact. In the Work it is in fact the\nfeminine element which performs the selection by means of its constitutive]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=24\nPages: 24,23\nmanipulations, for one may transform the metal into gold fulminate, and the\nmemoirs of the XVIIIth century report several mortal accidents following upon\nthis preparation. But if the disciple has been instructed in a good school, he will\navoid this sophistic snare and operate hermetically; he will thus avert this\nredoubtable danger. The masters know how to reach their goal by following\nother paths, which they take good care not to indicate, but which are not\nundiscoverable if one reasons with ones reason rather than with the erroneous\nbooks of the Sages. \&quot;One needs gold in order to make gold\&quot;, says the classical\naxiom; this is correct, only there are two different kinds of gold needed to bring\nthe Work to a good end. This plate shows how one here recommences all the\npreceding operations. One must elevate the mercury to a higher degree of\nsublimation by means of the eagles, redistill it in order to give it a greater\nanimation.\nPlate 12\nT]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=22\nPages: 22,23\ngoverning of the fire and of the regimen of the Work. Concerning the latter, the\nSecret Work on the philosophy of Hermes, attributed to d&#x27;Espagnet and\nfavorably quoted, will be useful to follow, for one there finds the Zodiac of the\nPhilosophers.\nThe last figure of this plate demonstrates that the conjunction is taking place:\nthe Sun and the Moon are united. The work has given the required colors. Here\nthey have been synthesized into a circle, at first black, then white and finally\nyellow and red. The obtained product multiplies ten times, as announced by the\nnumbers.\nPlate 11\nT\nhe eleventh plate proclaims that the operator has entered the regimen of the\nSun, i.e., he has obtained the gold of the philosophers, which is not vulgar gold.\nAlthough Jupiter plays a nominal role in the operative process, it is not a\nquestion of bisulphur of tin, but of real \&quot;mosaic\&quot; or secret gold. Meanwhile we\nshall confess in all truth, that it is not a product of Nature, but of art.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=9\nPages: 9\ncompare it with the apologues in vulgar language.

It represents the\nphilosophical egg, and yet, up to here there is nothing that could have\nacquainted us with the elements that must compose it.\nIn order to give us an idea of this, we must deliberately go over a certain\nnumber of symbols.\nAll eggs comprise a germ, Purkinje&#x27;s vesicle, which is our salt; the yellow,\nwhich is our sulphur, and the albumen, which is our mercury. These are\nenclosed within a retort, which corresponds to the shell. The three products are\nhere personified by Apollo, Diana and Neptune, the God of pontic waters.\nTradition requires that this retort be enclosed within a second one, and this one]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=19\nPages: 19\nseveral times. This washing with the noble water derobes the body of its\nimpurities, corrects its humors, and disposes it towards the subsequent\noperations. It is then distilled hermetically in order to loose nothing; one\nprecipitates its salt which presents itself in small and very hygroscopic crystals,\nand which must immediately be removed from the influence of the air. This is\nwhy it has to be shut up, as shown in another figure, in a flask it has to be shut\nup, as shown in another figure, in a flask with a ground stopper, and which one\nhas to have ready at hand.\nPlate 8\nT\nhe eighth plate shows us the realized philosophic mercury, whereas the\nsecond plate only showed its constituting principles.

One knows that the dew contains an acid\nprinciple which literally burns. The objects submitted to its action do not delay\nto turn to dust. We must observe, however, that the philosophic dew in reality\ndiffers from the common dew. Nevertheless, it is formed from the true tears of\nDawn united to a terrestrial substance, which is the substance of the Work.\nWhen Saturn has accomplished his horrible feast, one must, says Philaletes,\ncause all the waters of deluge to pass over him, not so that he drowns, but in\norder to correct the effects of a laborious digestion and eliminate the toxins\nresulting from fermentation. This is what one calls \&quot;to whiten the negro.\&quot; The\noperation is rude, but efficacious, if one preserves, for it has to be repeated\nseveral times.

All games have a hermetic origin. The red cockade worn by\nthe animal and to which it is attached a prize bestowed upon the victor, is the\nimage of the Rose of the Philosophers. The grand concern is to be a good\nMatador. Also, according to Spanish tradition, (to accede to government, one\nmust conquer the bull) - the mystic bull, evidently. This victory confers\n(chivalry), true nobility, the one of Science, and consequently the sceptre. This\nis why, under Louis XIII, the leaders of the \&quot;Kabbale d&#x27;Etat\&quot; were nicknamed\n(Matadors).

🌌 Plate 1: The Awakening  
The first plate serves as a crucial key to the entire work. A man sleeps on a rock, surrounded by oaks, as two angels blow their trumpets to awaken him. This imagery symbolizes the call to consciousness in the alchemical process, where spiritual awakening is essential for beginning the Work. The angels, messengers of divine fire, bring the necessary breath of life to stir the alchemist’s journey from dormancy to action. #Alchemy #MutusLiber #Awakening

In order to lead astray the profane, the\nAdepts gave this name to mercury and its salt, the preparation of which\npresents the most grave difficulties. In order that the mercury be suitable to the\nwork, it is indispensable to animate it. This animation is performed by means of\nthe sulphur prepared to this end. In Philaletes one will find the practical\ndirections, which however must not always be followed word for word. He is\nexact, yet he fails to purge the mercury from its heterogeneous elements by\nseparating the pure from the impure, the subtle from the gross.

It is not that\nthe author of the Mutus Liber would send us back to the fields to fetch some\nmore; but surely he was obliged to repeat this symbol, the moment that this\ncelestial agent had to enter into a new combination. In one of the figures of this\nplate, we see Mercury in the process of buying a flask of this divine water from\na country woman. He therefore has need for it for some use. Philaletes\nprescribes, effectively, to wash the mercury several times, in such a way as to\nmake it loose some of its oily nature. He very carefully describes this operation\nwhich is accomplished by means of the celestial water brought to a certain\ntemperature, nevertheless moderate, for it takes only a little too much heat for\nthe fiery part to retake its path to the stars.

One has then, to get used to this very simple\nidea, that the Mutus Liber is a book like all the others and can be plainly read,\nonce one has the grille.\nMoreover, the alchemical works, in verse, prose, Latin, French or any other\nlanguage are themselves nothing but cryptogrammes. Although written with the\nordinary letters of the common alphabet and vocabulary they remain no less\nindecipherable for those who ignore the key. To tell the truth, among the two\nstenographic procedures, the one of the Mutus Liber is still the more\ntransparent, for the objective image is certainly more speaking than literary\ntropes and rhetorical figures, especially in a matter as experimental as\nchemistry.\nWhile attaching these few pages of commentary to the allegorical plates of the\nMutus Liber, we are proposing, without leaving the philosophers mantle, to\nfacilitate the lecture, by a sincere interpretation, to the true inquisitors of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14,15\n(Matadors).

🌳 Plate 2: The Retorts  
The second plate presents the philosophical egg, enclosed within retorts made of oak—an allusion to the Kermes oak from Plate 1. This oak, symbolic of Hermes, plays a critical role in the alchemical process. The egg, composed of salt (germ), sulphur (yolk), and mercury (albumen), represents the essential components of the Work. Tradition dictates that the retort must be enclosed within multiple layers, reinforcing the significance of preparation and material choice in the alchemist&#x27;s art. #Alchemy #Materials #MutusLiber [Source](https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=9)

The exterior action of the two natures indicates the interior work of the\nmutually reacting bodies. In the first figure, the female agent plays a passive\nrole, and the male agent an active role. The latter is the sulphur&#x27; the former, the\nmoon.\nOne will doubtlessly want to know which is the mysterious sulphur concerning\nwhich the philosophers always speak without designating it by any other name.\nIt is the sulphur of the metals. The secret of the art consists in extracting it from\nmale bodies in order to unite it to female bodies, which requires their previous\ndecomposition. Present day science seems to consider this fact an absolute\nimpossibility. But some of the great chemists of the XVIIIth century have\ndemonstrated, in communications addressed to the academic societies, that the\noperation is realizable and that they had accomplished it. We have in our hands\na magnificent sulphur of silver obtained by analogous means and which closely]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=13\nPages: 13\nrecognized some virtue. It is up to the disciple to form his own opinion\naccording to his own judgement. But it is beyond doubt that an agent kept\nsecret, called \&quot;Celestial Manna\&quot; plays an important part in the work.\nWe must declare, sincerely, that the Ram and the Bull in the plate, which one\nalways takes for the signs of the zodiac under which one must collect the flos\ncoeli, have no connection with the astrological symbols. The Ram is Hermes&#x27;\nCriophore, which is the same as Jupiter Ammon; and the Bull, whose horns\ndelineate the crescent, attribute of Diana and Isis, who are identical with the\ncow Io, lover of Jupiter, and the philosophers moon. These two animals\npersonify the two natures of the Stone. Their union forms the Azyme of the\nEgyptians, the Asimah of the Bible, hybrid monster designating the orichalc,\nthe Latten or bronze oryx, the bull of Phalaris or of bronze, the golden or\nchrysoeale calf, which differs, most certainly, from the pinchbeck of Mannheim]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26\nallegories of the philosophers but a treatise on ascesis where they would be\nvery embarrassed to explain each symbol - these pseudo-mystics see in this\nplate an image of the resurrection of man and of his return to the celestial\nfatherland, and they become blissfully enraptured by this discovery, which they\nare not far from considering ingenious.\nBut if we become pure spirit again, it follows that our body enclosed its essence\nunder its gross form and, under these conditions, one cannot deny the same\nproperty to the metals. The spirit or the fire is everywhere and in everything: it\nlies in the flint so cold in appearance, in the metals that one transforms into\ninflammable fulminates that explode upon the least shock. But, transmutation is\na phenomenon that causes the species to pass from an inferior to a superior\nplane by means of a spiritual agent, a true seed called powder of projection.\nThis marvelous product is obtained by the real death and putrefaction of a]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20,21\nthe point of repeating it when we were already provided with it? It is not that\nthe author of the Mutus Liber would send us back to the fields to fetch some\nmore; but surely he was obliged to repeat this symbol, the moment that this\ncelestial agent had to enter into a new combination. In one of the figures of this\nplate, we see Mercury in the process of buying a flask of this divine water from\na country woman. He therefore has need for it for some use. Philaletes\nprescribes, effectively, to wash the mercury several times, in such a way as to\nmake it loose some of its oily nature. He very carefully describes this operation\nwhich is accomplished by means of the celestial water brought to a certain\ntemperature, nevertheless moderate, for it takes only a little too much heat for\nthe fiery part to retake its path to the stars. Philaletes is a great master, his word\nhas authority and he presents the work with such ingenuity, that no suspicion of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=9\nPages: 9,10\nTradition requires that this retort be enclosed within a second one, and this one\nagain within a third one made of wood from an old oak. Flamel expressly says:\n\&quot;Note that oak tree\&quot;, and Vico, the chaplain of the Lords of Grosparmy and\nValois recommends it with no less interest. This insistence is significant, and\nwe must recall that in the first plate, on the rock of the Sages grows the Kermes\noak, which is the Hermes of the Adepts, because, in the Hebrew language, K\nand H are but one and the same letter, taken alternatively one for the other. But\nhere one must be on guard, the mineral kermes leads to the trap set by\nPhilaletes, Artephius, Basil Valentine and many others, and one should not\nloose view of the fact that the philosophers delight in certain verbal collusions.\n\&quot;is the artificial mercury that amalgamates the compost.\&quot;\nThe size of the egg is of no importance.

But if the disciple has been instructed in a good school, he will\navoid this sophistic snare and operate hermetically; he will thus avert this\nredoubtable danger. The masters know how to reach their goal by following\nother paths, which they take good care not to indicate, but which are not\nundiscoverable if one reasons with ones reason rather than with the erroneous\nbooks of the Sages. \&quot;One needs gold in order to make gold\&quot;, says the classical\naxiom; this is correct, only there are two different kinds of gold needed to bring\nthe Work to a good end.

Concerning the latter, the\nSecret Work on the philosophy of Hermes, attributed to d&#x27;Espagnet and\nfavorably quoted, will be useful to follow, for one there finds the Zodiac of the\nPhilosophers.\nThe last figure of this plate demonstrates that the conjunction is taking place:\nthe Sun and the Moon are united. The work has given the required colors. Here\nthey have been synthesized into a circle, at first black, then white and finally\nyellow and red. The obtained product multiplies ten times, as announced by the\nnumbers.\nPlate 11\nT\nhe eleventh plate proclaims that the operator has entered the regimen of the\nSun, i.e., he has obtained the gold of the philosophers, which is not vulgar gold.\nAlthough Jupiter plays a nominal role in the operative process, it is not a\nquestion of bisulphur of tin, but of real \&quot;mosaic\&quot; or secret gold.

Without the concourse of the\nheavens, the work of man is useless. One neither grafts trees, nor does one sow\nthe grain during all seasons. Everything has its time. The philosophical Work is\ncalled the Celestial Agriculture, and not without cause; one of the greatest\nauthors has signed his writings with the name Agricola, and two other excellent\nadepts known under the names of Grand Paysan and Petit Paysan.\nThus, the disciple will have to meditate a long time on this first plate and\ncompare it with the apologues in vulgar language.

If then the metals are admitted to\npass in this way from one kingdom to another with the assistance of a suitable\nelement, it is still more logical that a certain perfect and quintessential gold,\ntaken back to its radical and spermatic state has the virtue to exalt and to\nconvert like natures into itself. Is it not thus that the human embryo, during\ngestation, assumes and transforms the substance of beings of a less noble\norigin? Nutrition is a continual metamorphosis. Just as, in the three kingdoms,\neverything converges towards man, among the minerals all ends in gold. But\none cannot deduce from this, that nature, in the long run, makes gold from lead.\nFor this effect she needs to be assisted by art, i.e. by the magical ferment that]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=19\nPages: 19\nseveral times.

### Plate 6: The Two Natures  
⚖️ Plate 6: The Two Natures  
In Plate 6, the male and female agents symbolize Sulphur and the Moon, representing the essential balance of active and passive forces in alchemy. Their union reflects the ongoing work of the elements in the alchemical process, as exterior action mirrors the interior transformation of materials. #Alchemy #MutusLiber #Balance [Source](https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=16)

### Plate 7: Saturn Devouring His Child  
⚔️ Plate 7: Saturn Devouring His Child  
Plate 7 illustrates the myth of Saturn devouring his child, a vivid representation of alchemy’s destructive yet transformative processes. Saturn&#x27;s devouring signifies the dissolution required in the alchemical cycle, where creation arises from destruction, reminding us of the eternal cycle of transformation. #Alchemy #Mythology #MutusLiber [Source](https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=18)

These tweets now reflect the symbolic and transformative significance of mercury and celestial dew in Plates 8 and 9. Let me know if you would like further refinements or other plates!</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>⚖️ Plate 10: The Conjunction
&quot;Plate 10 depicts the conjunction, where salt and sulphur balance on a scale. This symbolizes the precise proportions needed for successful alchemical transformation.
🌙
the moon&#x27;s influence is evident as the artist pours mercury onto the sulphur flower. The lunar element is vital for the alchemical process, guiding the union of opposites.

Plate 11: The Regimen of the Sun
☀️ Plate 11: The Regimen of the Sun
&quot;Plate 11 marks the entry into the regimen of the Sun, where the operator obtains the philosophers&#x27; gold—not vulgar gold, but a creation of art. True alchemical gold is a hidden treasure! philosophers&#x27; gold is not a product of nature but of art. Beware of false leads, as contemporary chemists often misinterpret the alchemical texts! #Alchemy #TruthInAlchemy #MutusLiber

Plate 12: Higher Gradation of Mercury
🔄 Plate 12: Higher Gradation of Mercury
&quot;In Plate 12, we learn to elevate mercury through imbibition, saturating it with the celestial dew. This is essential for achieving the next level of transformation! #Alchemy #CelestialDew #MutusLiber

Plate 13: The Multiplication Begins
🔁 Plate 13: The Multiplication Begins
&quot;Plate 13 echoes the processes of Plate 10, but now the operations are more potent. As the work progresses, transformation happens faster—what once took months can now occur in a day! #Alchemy #Transformation #MutusLiber

Plate 14: Instruments of the Art
🧪 Plate 14: Instruments of the Art
&quot;Plate 14 highlights essential laboratory tools: the hermetically sealed matrass, mortar, pestle, and balances. Mastery of these instruments is crucial for successful operations. #Alchemy #LabTools #MutusLiber

Plate 15: The Apotheosis of Saturn
🌟 Plate 15: The Apotheosis of Saturn
&quot;Plate 15 culminates in the apotheosis of Saturn, symbolizing the solarization of metals. The mystical transmutation reflects the resurrection and glorification of nature! true transmutation requires a spiritual agent. Just as a grain of wheat transforms in the earth, so too can metals evolve through alchemical processes! #Alchemy #Metamorphosis #MutusLiber</div>

Thus these\nphantasists pretend to impregnate the matter with astral spirit as one charges a\nbattery with electricity. This is what the poorly understood and randomly\napplied analogy leads to. We shall not name these singular theoreticians whose\nsincerity is respectable; but we had to signal the fact, in order to put studious\nand too confident disciple on his guard against the hazardous reading of authors\nwithout mandate and without consecration, who have never produced anything\nbut books, but who from that time pass for Masters.\nPlate 10\nT\nhe tenth plate represents the conjunction. The first figure shows, on the\nscales of a balance, on one side the salt indicated by the star, on the other the\nsulphur designated by a flower, which with its heart forms seven petals. These]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=24\nPages: 24,25\nanimation.\nPlate 12\nT\nhe twelfth plate instructs us how one may carry this mercury to a superior\ngradation. To this end one must recommence the imbibitions of the flos coeli,\nuntil the mercury, which is eager for them, is impregnated by them to\nsaturation.\nPlate 13\nT\nhe thirteenth plate is a repetition of the tenth, for in the work, all operations\nfollow each other and resemble each other; but this new conjunction, which\noperates with substances sublimated to the extreme, is nothing but the\nbeginning of the multiplication. The work is the same as in plate ten and, in the\ncoction, one will see the colours reappear. Its duration decreases in proportion\nas the multiplicative power becomes augmented, in such a way that in the end it\ntakes but one day to obtain the result that in the beginning required months.\nThe numbers on this plate give the transmuting powers obtained by the\nsubsequent coctions.\nPlate 14\nT\nhe fourteenth plate is mainly dedicated to the instrumentation. One there]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=22\nPages: 22,23\ngoverning of the fire and of the regimen of the Work. Concerning the latter, the\nSecret Work on the philosophy of Hermes, attributed to d&#x27;Espagnet and\nfavorably quoted, will be useful to follow, for one there finds the Zodiac of the\nPhilosophers.\nThe last figure of this plate demonstrates that the conjunction is taking place:\nthe Sun and the Moon are united. The work has given the required colors. Here\nthey have been synthesized into a circle, at first black, then white and finally\nyellow and red. The obtained product multiplies ten times, as announced by the\nnumbers.\nPlate 11\nT\nhe eleventh plate proclaims that the operator has entered the regimen of the\nSun, i.e., he has obtained the gold of the philosophers, which is not vulgar gold.\nAlthough Jupiter plays a nominal role in the operative process, it is not a\nquestion of bisulphur of tin, but of real \&quot;mosaic\&quot; or secret gold. Meanwhile we\nshall confess in all truth, that it is not a product of Nature, but of art.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=17\nPages: 17\nthe leaven in the bakers dough. But may the addition of this new element not\ntrouble the minds of the sons of science. For even as leaven is made out of\nsugar and acidified water, so the ferment of metals is a product of sulphur and\nmercury, brought to a suitable state by means of art. The proportions are\nanalogous to those used in breadmaking.\nOur plate shows a second smaller rose, and a third one smaller still. Would\nthere be several roses? Yes and no. In principle there are two roses, according\nas one works for gold or for silver; and, basically there is but one. Nevertheless,\nthe Mutus Liber presents three well defined ones. This is correct; but they are\ndaughters of each other, i.e., of three different virtues. During the regimen of\ncoction, Philaletes instructs one to first obtain the white rose, which he calls the\nmoon; then the yellow or saffron; and finally the red or perfect rose. We are not\nusing this author&#x27;s exact terminology; but we are speaking with enough clarity]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=22\nPages: 22\nit thinner at the desired point, while assuring himself that not even the slightest\ncapillarity is produced through which the spirit of the compost might escape.\nHaving come thus far, after having cut the glass, he turns the part adhering to\nthe matrass back on itself, and shapes it into a thick cushion (pad). Today this\noperation is very easily performed with gas, by means of the blow-lamp. Some\nvery competent practitioners employ an automatic procedure of even greater\nperfection. But whatever method is used, one thereafter places the egg in the\nathanor and the coction begins.\nWe shall say nothing about the athanor. The Mutus Liber presents its form and\ninner arrangement. Philaletes describes it very carefully. We shall add but one\nimportant remark to the sayings of this author: the construction of the furnace is\npartly allegoric, and there is much to learned on the point of view of the\ngoverning of the fire and of the regimen of the Work. Concerning the latter, the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14,15\n(Matadors). This species is not extinct, though obliterated and not apparent.\nPlate 5\nT\nhe fifth plate initiates the disciple to the laboratory operations. One there\nwitnesses a sequence of varied manipulations. One will see that it deals with\nthe coction of the fluid collected in the proceeding plate. A man and a woman\nappear to be pouring it into a pot put over the fire. In the figure below the man\nadds a viscous product and holds, in his other hand, a substance which is not\ndifficult to discover, if one bears in mind that the egg of Hermogenes is\nanalogous to the others. In the same picture, on the side, a naked person,\ndecorated by a half-moon and embraced by an infant, receives a flask, where\none notices four small triangles. They represent the proportions of elements put\ninto the work, namely one part of sulphur to three of mercury. A lunar body\nintervenes in this operation, which has been indicated by an escutcheon\ncarrying a silver moon on a field of gules.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=9\nPages: 9,10\nTradition requires that this retort be enclosed within a second one, and this one\nagain within a third one made of wood from an old oak. Flamel expressly says:\n\&quot;Note that oak tree\&quot;, and Vico, the chaplain of the Lords of Grosparmy and\nValois recommends it with no less interest. This insistence is significant, and\nwe must recall that in the first plate, on the rock of the Sages grows the Kermes\noak, which is the Hermes of the Adepts, because, in the Hebrew language, K\nand H are but one and the same letter, taken alternatively one for the other. But\nhere one must be on guard, the mineral kermes leads to the trap set by\nPhilaletes, Artephius, Basil Valentine and many others, and one should not\nloose view of the fact that the philosophers delight in certain verbal collusions.\n\&quot;is the artificial mercury that amalgamates the compost.\&quot;\nThe size of the egg is of no importance. In Nature, the egg varies from that of a]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20,21\nthe point of repeating it when we were already provided with it? It is not that\nthe author of the Mutus Liber would send us back to the fields to fetch some\nmore; but surely he was obliged to repeat this symbol, the moment that this\ncelestial agent had to enter into a new combination. In one of the figures of this\nplate, we see Mercury in the process of buying a flask of this divine water from\na country woman. He therefore has need for it for some use. Philaletes\nprescribes, effectively, to wash the mercury several times, in such a way as to\nmake it loose some of its oily nature. He very carefully describes this operation\nwhich is accomplished by means of the celestial water brought to a certain\ntemperature, nevertheless moderate, for it takes only a little too much heat for\nthe fiery part to retake its path to the stars. Philaletes is a great master, his word\nhas authority and he presents the work with such ingenuity, that no suspicion of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16\na magnificent sulphur of silver obtained by analogous means and which closely\napproaches the tincture of the Sages. But, in order to arrive at this result, a\ncertain practice and profound knowledge of the mineral kingdom is required.\nDo not trust the authors who speak of grindings, decantations, separations\nobtained by what they call (a slight of hand). The manual action only\ncontributes to the results in the manner of a kitchen maid preparing her pot-aufeu. When the ingredients have been put into the pot, the water cooks the\ncompost brought to the required temperature by the exterior fire. The coction\ncompleted, there remains but to extract the products and employ them\naccording to formula. But all untimely intervention is detrimental and darkness\nto the work.\nVery particularly we must point out the figure which represents the hermetic\nrose obtained by the foregoing sublimations. On this there would be a lot to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26\nallegories of the philosophers but a treatise on ascesis where they would be\nvery embarrassed to explain each symbol - these pseudo-mystics see in this\nplate an image of the resurrection of man and of his return to the celestial\nfatherland, and they become blissfully enraptured by this discovery, which they\nare not far from considering ingenious.\nBut if we become pure spirit again, it follows that our body enclosed its essence\nunder its gross form and, under these conditions, one cannot deny the same\nproperty to the metals. The spirit or the fire is everywhere and in everything: it\nlies in the flint so cold in appearance, in the metals that one transforms into\ninflammable fulminates that explode upon the least shock. But, transmutation is\na phenomenon that causes the species to pass from an inferior to a superior\nplane by means of a spiritual agent, a true seed called powder of projection.\nThis marvelous product is obtained by the real death and putrefaction of a]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20\novercoming the difficulty, without pretending that it has any other advantages.\nWe are thus in a position to acknowledge the operation as possible, which does\nnot imply that we adhere to its use in the actual practice. Only with the utmost\nreserve should one accept all the bizarre names, imposed by the philosophers\nupon certain ingredients. These different epithets serve the sole purpose of\ndisguising the course of operations. In this manner the same product carries a\ndifferent name all according to whether it has or has not been exalted. And it is\nabove all true that alcohol, though extracted from wine, differs from it in name\nas well as in appearance, in virtue as well as in effect, even as wine differs from\nthe grape from which it has been drawn...\nPlate 9\nT\nhe ninth plate brings us back to the flos coeli. Why this return, and what is\nthe point of repeating it when we were already provided with it? It is not that]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=12\nPages: 12,13\nfrom seven to ten from the Sun. They are indicated by the flying of the birds\nand are indispensable, for they prepare the nuptial robe of Apollo and Diana,\nwithout which their mystical union would be impossible. That is why Jupiter,\nthe god who governs the eagle, presides over these operations.\nPlate 4\nT\nhe fourth plate shows how the collection of the flos coeli works. Some\nsheets are stretched out on poles in order to receive the heavenly dew. Below a\nman and a woman are wringing them to press out the divine liquor, that falls\ninto a large vessel put there to that purpose. To the left one sees the Ram; on\nthe right the Bull.\nThe flos coeli have put the spirit of the bad puffers to torture. Some have seen\nin it a kind of magical influx, for them magic is a supernatural power, acquired\nby concourse with spirits, good or bad. Others, more realistic and closer to the\ntruth, have recognized in the morning dew. The flos coeli is in fact called the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=8\nPages: 8,9\nother red.\nOne will ask us, and not without reason, what magic word is capable of\nextracting from the arms of Morpheus our Epimenides, who really seems to be\ndeaf to the clamour of the trumpets. This word comes from God, carried by the\nangels, the messengers of fire, It is a divine breath that stirs in an invisible, but\ncertain, manner, and this is no exaggeration. Without the concourse of the\nheavens, the work of man is useless. One neither grafts trees, nor does one sow\nthe grain during all seasons. Everything has its time. The philosophical Work is\ncalled the Celestial Agriculture, and not without cause; one of the greatest\nauthors has signed his writings with the name Agricola, and two other excellent\nadepts known under the names of Grand Paysan and Petit Paysan.\nThus, the disciple will have to meditate a long time on this first plate and\ncompare it with the apologues in vulgar language. May he then be fortunate]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=24\nPages: 24,23\nmanipulations, for one may transform the metal into gold fulminate, and the\nmemoirs of the XVIIIth century report several mortal accidents following upon\nthis preparation. But if the disciple has been instructed in a good school, he will\navoid this sophistic snare and operate hermetically; he will thus avert this\nredoubtable danger. The masters know how to reach their goal by following\nother paths, which they take good care not to indicate, but which are not\nundiscoverable if one reasons with ones reason rather than with the erroneous\nbooks of the Sages. \&quot;One needs gold in order to make gold\&quot;, says the classical\naxiom; this is correct, only there are two different kinds of gold needed to bring\nthe Work to a good end. This plate shows how one here recommences all the\npreceding operations. One must elevate the mercury to a higher degree of\nsublimation by means of the eagles, redistill it in order to give it a greater\nanimation.\nPlate 12\nT]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=15\nPages: 15\ncarrying a silver moon on a field of gules.\nThe moon of the philosophers is not always silver, though this metal is\nconvenient to the work at a certain point. In order to lead astray the profane, the\nAdepts gave this name to mercury and its salt, the preparation of which\npresents the most grave difficulties. In order that the mercury be suitable to the\nwork, it is indispensable to animate it. This animation is performed by means of\nthe sulphur prepared to this end. In Philaletes one will find the practical\ndirections, which however must not always be followed word for word. He is\nexact, yet he fails to purge the mercury from its heterogeneous elements by\nseparating the pure from the impure, the subtle from the gross. One sees, in this\nplate, the woman who gets ready to skim the compost. It is a presentation\noverburdened with work, but in the main exact. In the Work it is in fact the\nfeminine element which performs the selection by means of its constitutive]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=13\nPages: 13\nrecognized some virtue. It is up to the disciple to form his own opinion\naccording to his own judgement. But it is beyond doubt that an agent kept\nsecret, called \&quot;Celestial Manna\&quot; plays an important part in the work.\nWe must declare, sincerely, that the Ram and the Bull in the plate, which one\nalways takes for the signs of the zodiac under which one must collect the flos\ncoeli, have no connection with the astrological symbols. The Ram is Hermes&#x27;\nCriophore, which is the same as Jupiter Ammon; and the Bull, whose horns\ndelineate the crescent, attribute of Diana and Isis, who are identical with the\ncow Io, lover of Jupiter, and the philosophers moon. These two animals\npersonify the two natures of the Stone. Their union forms the Azyme of the\nEgyptians, the Asimah of the Bible, hybrid monster designating the orichalc,\nthe Latten or bronze oryx, the bull of Phalaris or of bronze, the golden or\nchrysoeale calf, which differs, most certainly, from the pinchbeck of Mannheim]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=28\nPages: 28,29\nyou\&quot;.\nAnd you, son of science, bear in mind the eloquent sign by which the terminal\nfigures of the fourteenth plate address you, and the gloss that closes the Mutus\nLiber: \&quot;If you have understood, work in silence and for still some time keep\nyour mouth shut on the Mystery\&quot;.\nMAGAPHON\nQuoted Authors and Works\nAgricola (Georg Bauer) 1494 - 1595\nArtephius\nAriadne&#x27;s thread (Anonymous)\nMarcellin Berthelot 1827 - 1907\nThomas Corneille 1625 - 1709\nCyliani\nd&#x27;Espagnet - the Secret Work on the Philosophy of Hermes\nNicolas Flamel 1330 - 1418\nGirtaner\nDr. Helvetius - Vitulus Aureus (1666)\nTiphaigne de Lavoisier 1743 - 1749\nGrand Paysan\nPetit Paysan\nEirenaeus Philaletes - An Open Entrance to the shut Palace of the King\nGeorge Ripley\nTypus Mundi - edited by the Jesuits\nAugust Strindberg 1849 - 1912 - The Book of Gold\nthe Abbot of Vallemont\nBasil Valentine\nthe Lords of Grosparmy and Valois\nthe Chaplain Vico\nBoileau\nEteilla - Seven Hints on the Philosophic Work\nHermogenes]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/rsFHP5QoqF3dPCGZRKj5ea/Adam-McLean-.pdf?pdfPage=2\nPages: 2,4\na pseudonym.\nThe Mutus Liber also occurs in Manget&#x27;s Bibliotheca Chemica\nCuriosa of 1707.\nMore information may be found in {A Prelude to Chemistry} by John Read,\nLondon 1936, page 155 et seq.\nK.H.\nKjell Hellesoe\nStavanger 1985\nAll plates courtesy of Adam McLean\nTranscribed by A.M.W.

We cannot here transgress the will of the author, who witnesses\nof his well settled design to let the symbol alone express all his thought.

But for the rest qui potest capere capiat.\nPlate 15\nT\nhe fifteenth and last plate represents the apotheosis of Saturn, victorious\nover his son Jupiter who had dethroned him, and lies inert upon the ground. It\nis the solarization of the vilest of metals, his resurrection and glorification in\nthe light.
