| Introduction               | Overview of alchemy’s historiographical transformation from pseudoscience to a respected part of the history of science, emphasizing its interrelation with religion. Discusses the New Historiography led by Newman and Principe and notes prior neglect of alchemy&#x27;s religious aspects.                                                 | Highlights the shift in historical understanding of alchemy and its ties to Christianity, positioning alchemy as both scientific and spiritually integrated during medieval and early modern periods.                                                                                                            | Identifies the historiographical oversight of alchemy’s religious dimensions and misconceptions about its association with magic or heterodoxy, setting the stage for a nuanced exploration.                                                             | Alchemy and religion were historically interconnected rather than oppositional, challenging modern assumptions of incompatibility.                                                                                 | &quot;In the process of detaching alchemy from the ‘occult’ […] many of us have minimized or neglected alchemy’s religious dimension.&quot;                                                                                     | Newman and Principe; Nummedal; Matus; Baldwin; historical records on Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and others.                                                                                                    |
| Historiography            | Explores Newman and Principe’s contributions to redefining alchemy and the critique by scholars like Brian Vickers, addressing the dismissal of alchemy as pseudoscience and its link to the occult.                                                                                                            | Establishes alchemy as integral to science history by refuting its pseudoscientific label and clarifying its practical, not mystical, applications.                                                                                                                       | Challenges reductionist interpretations that frame alchemy solely as occult or fraudulent. Addresses ongoing skepticism about its orthodoxy within Christianity.                                                                                          | Alchemy was historically seen as a legitimate, natural art, often distinct from magic, despite modern misconceptions.                                                                                              | &quot;The hackneyed view that automatically equates alchemy with witchcraft, necromancy, and […] the occult has little historical validity before the nineteenth century.&quot;                                                 | Newman’s &quot;Promethean Ambitions&quot;; Vickers’ critique; works on medieval scholastics such as Albertus Magnus.                                                                                                       |
