| Introduction            | Discusses the historical use of the Bible in alchemical practices, focusing on allegorical readings that interpreted scripture as containing secrets of transmutation.                                                                                                         | Connects alchemical practices to hermeneutics and biblical allegory, suggesting shared interpretive origins.                                                                                                                                        | Highlights how alchemists’ use of scripture was often dismissed as misinterpretation or heresy.                                                                                                                   | Alchemy employed the Bible as a source of both scientific inspiration and spiritual metaphors.         | “The Bible has been quoted to many ends... few applications seem farther fetched today than those which alchemists once made.”                                                | References Paul’s warning about “science falsely so called” and examples from Montaigne and Donne on alchemical allegory.                                                                                                           |
| Biblical Foundations    | Details how early alchemists drew from biblical texts like Genesis and the Book of Enoch, viewing transmutation as divinely sanctioned.                                                                                                                                    | Shows the Bible&#x27;s centrality in constructing alchemy&#x27;s divine origins and symbolic system.                                                                                                                                                          | Examines tensions between Church authorities and alchemists on the literal and allegorical readings of scripture.                                                                                              | Alchemy relied on typological and archetypal readings of the Bible to validate its practices and goals. | “The Book of Enoch gave alchemy a divine origin, but also a demonic cast.”                                                                    | Tertullian, Jude, and works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Renaissance Interpretations | Explores how alchemy’s symbolic chains of being and tradition were challenged during the Renaissance by figures like Copernicus and Casaubon.                                                                                                                  | Demonstrates the Renaissance&#x27;s role in both advancing and disrupting alchemical traditions, blending science and biblical allegory.                                                                                                               | Reflects on the collapse of medieval worldviews that supported alchemical interpretations of the Bible.                                                                                                          | Renaissance alchemy sought to reconcile outward natural phenomena with spiritual truths.               | “Copernicus took the lower links off the chain of being... Casaubon broke the chain of tradition.”                                            | References to the works of Copernicus, Casaubon, and Goethe on the interplay between tradition and innovation.                                                                                                                       |
| Modern Reappraisals     | Discusses how figures like Jung and Frye analyzed alchemy as a psychological and literary phenomenon rather than a scientific one.                                                                                                                                   | Provides a framework to interpret alchemy’s symbolic value in modern psychology and literary theory, particularly through archetypes.                                                                                                              | Challenges Jung’s dualistic view by emphasizing the integration of matter and spirit in alchemy’s biblical interpretations.                                                                                      | Alchemy bridges metaphysical and psychological domains through archetypal and typological systems.      | “Jung assumed that alchemists sought to free the spirit from matter rather than restore matter to its original perfection.”                             | Carl Jung, Northrop Frye, and Biblical references (e.g., Zechariah and Paul’s writings).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Symbolism and Typology  | Analyzes the typological and archetypal structures within alchemy, linking its symbols to biblical narratives such as the Creation and Last Judgment.                                                                                                                   | Establishes how biblical typology provided a narrative and symbolic foundation for alchemical practices.                                                                                                                                           | Suggests alchemy’s reliance on metaphors and typology contributed to its marginalization as science evolved.                                                                                                     | Alchemy integrated biblical typology with neo-Platonic archetypes to construct its symbolic framework.  | “The fiery furnace of Daniel harkened back to the ‘iron furnace’ of Egypt... but it also looked forward to the day of reckoning.”                          | Typological readings of Daniel, Zechariah, and Paracelsian concepts of refinement and transformation.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Conclusion              | Reflects on alchemy&#x27;s enduring relevance in literature and its symbolic resolution of tensions between matter and spirit.                                                                                                                                             | Highlights alchemy’s transformation into a literary and philosophical metaphor, continuing to influence modern thought.                                                                                                                            | Points out how Cartesian and Enlightenment frameworks suppressed alchemy’s holistic worldview but left space for its reinterpretation.                                                                             | Alchemy survives as a metaphorical science of transformation and self-discovery.                       | “The furnaces of affliction have become fountains of living waters.”                                                                           | References Blake, Joyce, and other literary reinterpretations of alchemy in modern narratives.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Genesis 1:2 (&quot;Earth…without form, and void&quot;) | Interpreted as a metaphor for primal chaos or materia prima, the initial unformed matter in alchemy, which can be transformed into pure substances like gold.                                                                                      |
