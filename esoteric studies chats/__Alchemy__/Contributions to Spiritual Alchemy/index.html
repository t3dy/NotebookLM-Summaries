Occultism in the Religious Culture of Early Modern England

Bruce Janacek
“Alchemists pursued the secrets of creation, and Alchemical Belief takes their aspirations seriously. With careful readings and well-chosen cases, Bruce Janacek demonstrates that alchemical writings need to be read in the context of their authors’ broader intellectual and devotional pursuits. Alchemical writings lent themselves to the expression of irenic, unifying aspirations for Christianity and provided solutions to the political and religious conflicts rending the early modern world. This argument is as refreshing as it is ambitious.”—Lauren Kassell, University of Cambridge

What did it mean to believe in alchemy in early modern England? In this book, Bruce Janacek considers alchemical beliefs in the context of the writings of Thomas Tymme, Robert Fludd, Francis Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and Elias Ashmole. Rather than examine alchemy from a scientific or medical perspective, Janacek presents it as integrated into the broader political, philosophical, and religious upheavals of the first half of the seventeenth century, arguing that the interest of these elite figures in alchemy was part of an understanding that supported their national—and in some cases royalist—loyalty and theological orthodoxy. Janacek investigates how and why individuals who supported or were actually placed at the traditional center of power in England’s church and state believed in the relevance of alchemy at a time when their society, their government, their careers, and, in some cases, their very lives were at stake.

Spiritual Alchemy
From Jacob Boehme to Mary Anne Atwood
Most professional historians see the relationship between pre-modern and modern alchemy as one of discontinuity and contrast. Mike A. Zuber challenges this dominant understanding and explores aspects of alchemy that have been neglected by recent work in the history of science. The predominant focus on the scientific aspect of alchemy, such as laboratory experiment, practical techniques, and material ingredients, argues Zuber, marginalizes the things that render alchemy so fascinating: its rich and vivid imagery, reliance on the medium of manuscript, and complicated relationship with religion.Spiritual Alchemy traces the early-modern antecedents of modern alchemy through generations of followers of Jacob Boehme, the cobbler and theosopher of Görlitz. As Boehme&#x27;s disciples down the generations -- including the Silesian nobleman Abraham von Franckenberg and the London-based German immigrant Dionysius Andreas Freher, among others -- studied his writings, they drew on his spiritual alchemy, adapted it, and communicated it to their contemporaries. Spiritual alchemy combines traditional elements of alchemical literature with Christian mysticism. Defying the boundaries between science and religion, this combination was transmitted from Görlitz ultimately to England. In 1850, it inspired a young woman, later known as Mary Anne Atwood, to write her Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery, usually seen as the first modern interpretation of alchemy. Drawing extensively on manuscript or otherwise obscure sources, Zuber documents continuity between pre-modern and modern forms of alchemy while exploring this hybrid phenomenon.

Description
Alchemy in Contemporary Art analyzes the manner in which twentieth-century artists, beginning with French Surrealists of the 1920s, have appropriated concepts and imagery from the western alchemical tradition. This study examines artistic production from c. 1920 to the present, with an emphasis on the 1970s to 2000, discussing familiar names such as Andre Breton, Salvador Dali, Yves Klein, Joseph Beuys, and Anselm Kiefer, as well as many little known artists of the later twentieth century. It provides a critical overview of the alchemical tradition in twentieth-century art, and of the use of occultist imagery as a code for political discourse and polemical engagement. The study is the first to examine the influence of alchemy and the Surrealist tradition on Australian as well as on Eastern European and Mexican art. In addition, the text considers the manner in which women artists such as Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo, and Rebecca Horn have critically revised the traditional sexist imagery of alchemy and occultism for their own feminist purposes.   The Alchemy of Light
Geometry and Optics in Late Renaissance Alchemical Illustration
Series: 
Symbola et Emblemata, Volume: 10
Author: Urszula Szulakowska
This study concerns the late Renaissance metaphysics of light in its adoption to a Paracelsian alchemical context by John Dee, Heinrich Khunrath, Michael Maier and Robert Fludd. Their alchemical theosophy is contextualised within Protestant reformism of the 1590s to 1620s, specifically that of Valentin Weigel and Johannes Arndt. This results in a re-assessment of the Rosicrucian movement which challenges the existing historiography and problematises the character of the movement. The volume includes fifty illustrations from alchemical treatises of the period, the emphasis being placed on Khunrath&#x27;s Amphiteatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (1595-1609). In an innovative manner, the study investigates these images using analytical tools drawn from semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism. This method yields an unusual interpretation of the geometry, optical diagrams and spatial structures employed in such alchemical engravings.

This study positions Paracelsian alchemy, medicine and medical physiology within the apocalyptic discourse of the Protestant Reformation. A comparison is made between alchemical theory concerning the perfectibility of prime matter and Christian eschatological doctrine concerning human salvation through Christ&#x27;s sacrifice in universal history and in the ritual of the mass. A detailed analysis is made of the engraved illustrations constituting an integral part of the alchemical medicine and physiology of Heinrich Khunrath, Stefan Michelspacher, Jacob Boehme, Abraham von Franckenberg and Robert Fludd.</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here&#x27;s a summary of the contributions of Urszula Szulakowska, Mike Zuber, and Bruce Janacek to the study of spiritual alchemy in the early modern period:

1. <strong>Bruce Janacek</strong>: In *Alchemical Belief: Occultism in the Religious Culture of Early Modern England*, Janacek explores the integration of alchemical beliefs with the broader political, philosophical, and religious upheavals in early modern England. He argues that alchemical writings were not just scientific or medical texts but were deeply embedded in the intellectual and devotional pursuits of figures like Thomas Tymme, Robert Fludd, and Francis Bacon. Janacek demonstrates how these writings reflected and supported the political and theological loyalties of their authors, providing solutions to the era&#x27;s conflicts and revealing alchemy&#x27;s role in shaping early modern religious culture.

2. <strong>Mike Zuber</strong>: In *Spiritual Alchemy: From Jacob Boehme to Mary Anne Atwood*, Zuber challenges the conventional view that pre-modern and modern alchemy are discontinuous. He highlights the continuity of alchemical thought through the work of Jacob Boehme and his followers, such as Abraham von Franckenberg and Dionysius Andreas Freher. Zuber examines how Boehme&#x27;s spiritual alchemy, which combined traditional alchemical elements with Christian mysticism, influenced later interpretations of alchemy, including Mary Anne Atwood&#x27;s modern perspective. By focusing on manuscript sources and the hybrid nature of alchemical literature, Zuber underscores the enduring impact of spiritual alchemy from the early modern period to the present.

3. <strong>Urszula Szulakowska</strong>: Szulakowska&#x27;s work includes several significant contributions to understanding alchemy in the early modern period. In *Alchemy in Contemporary Art*, she analyzes how 20th-century artists, including the Surrealists, have appropriated alchemical concepts and imagery.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div><strong>The State of Research on Early Modern Spiritual Alchemy: Contributions and Perspectives</strong>

The study of early modern spiritual alchemy has evolved considerably, reflecting broader shifts in historical and intellectual scholarship. Alchemy, a complex and multifaceted tradition, integrates scientific experimentation, philosophical speculation, and religious mysticism. This essay examines the state of research on early modern spiritual alchemy by integrating recent contributions from scholars such as Bruce Janacek, Mike Zuber, and Urszula Szulakowska. Each of these scholars brings a distinct perspective, revealing the intricate ways in which alchemy intersected with religious, political, and artistic contexts during the early modern period.

### Bruce Janacek’s Contextual Approach

Bruce Janacek’s *Alchemical Belief: Occultism in the Religious Culture of Early Modern England* offers a comprehensive examination of how alchemical beliefs were embedded in the broader intellectual and devotional life of early modern England. Janacek challenges the often narrow focus on alchemy as a purely scientific or medical pursuit. Instead, he situates alchemical writings within the tumultuous political and religious landscape of the first half of the seventeenth century.

Janacek’s analysis reveals that prominent figures such as Thomas Tymme, Robert Fludd, Francis Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and Elias Ashmole engaged with alchemy not merely as a scientific or experimental discipline but as a means to address and navigate the era’s political and religious conflicts. His approach underscores how alchemical writings were intertwined with the authors’ broader intellectual and devotional pursuits. For example, Janacek shows how Fludd’s alchemical writings reflected his commitment to unifying Christian aspirations amidst the sectarian strife of the time. Similarly, Bacon’s engagement with alchemy was part of a broader philosophical project aimed at reconciling scientific knowledge with theological orthodoxy.

Janacek’s work is significant for its argument that alchemy served as a tool for addressing the crises of the period. His study highlights how alchemical belief provided solutions to the conflicts and challenges faced by individuals who were deeply invested in the political and religious life of early modern England. By placing alchemical writings in this broader context, Janacek enriches our understanding of how alchemy functioned as a form of intellectual and devotional engagement rather than just a pursuit of esoteric knowledge.

### Mike Zuber’s Continuity and Transformation

In contrast to Janacek’s focus on early modern England, Mike Zuber’s *Spiritual Alchemy: From Jacob Boehme to Mary Anne Atwood* explores the continuity and transformation of alchemical thought from the early modern period to the modern era. Zuber challenges the prevailing scholarly view that pre-modern and modern alchemy are discontinuous. Instead, he traces a line of intellectual continuity through the followers of Jacob Boehme, a key figure in early modern spiritual alchemy.

Zuber’s work is particularly valuable for its examination of how Boehme’s spiritual alchemy influenced later interpretations of alchemy. Boehme’s writings, which combined traditional alchemical concepts with Christian mysticism, were adopted and adapted by later followers such as Abraham von Franckenberg and Dionysius Andreas Freher. These figures played a crucial role in transmitting Boehme’s ideas to later generations, including Mary Anne Atwood, whose *Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery* is often considered a seminal modern interpretation of alchemy.

By focusing on manuscript sources and the hybrid nature of alchemical literature, Zuber provides a nuanced view of how early modern alchemical ideas persisted and evolved into the modern period. His research highlights the importance of spiritual and mystical dimensions of alchemy, which are often overshadowed by the focus on scientific and practical aspects. Zuber’s work thus contributes to a deeper understanding of alchemy as a dynamic and evolving tradition that bridges pre-modern and modern intellectual landscapes.

### Urszula Szulakowska’s Artistic and Theoretical Contributions

Urszula Szulakowska’s research offers a distinctive perspective on early modern alchemy by examining its influence on art and its theoretical dimensions. In *Alchemy in Contemporary Art*, Szulakowska explores how twentieth-century artists appropriated alchemical concepts and imagery. Her study reveals how alchemical and occultist themes have been used not only as artistic motifs but also as codes for political and feminist discourse. Szulakowska’s analysis includes artists such as André Breton, Salvador Dalí, Yves Klein, Joseph Beuys, and Anselm Kiefer, as well as lesser-known figures from various regions.

Szulakowska’s work is notable for its critical overview of the alchemical tradition in contemporary art and its focus on the use of occultist imagery as a form of political engagement. She highlights how artists have reinterpreted traditional alchemical symbols and concepts to address contemporary issues, including political ideologies and feminist critiques. Her research underscores the enduring influence of alchemical imagery and thought, demonstrating its relevance beyond the early modern period.

In addition to her work on contemporary art, Szulakowska’s *The Alchemy of Light: Geometry and Optics in Late Renaissance Alchemical Illustration* examines the metaphysics of light in late Renaissance alchemical illustrations. By applying semiotic, structuralist, and post-structuralist analytical tools, Szulakowska offers a novel interpretation of the geometric and optical aspects of alchemical engravings. Her study re-assesses the Rosicrucian movement and its connections to Protestant reformism, providing new insights into the symbolic and theoretical dimensions of alchemical imagery.

Szulakowska’s *The Sacrificial Body and the Day of Doom: Alchemy and Apocalyptic Discourse in the Protestant Reformation* further explores the intersection of Paracelsian alchemy with Protestant eschatological thought. Her detailed analysis of alchemical and religious theories of perfection and salvation reveals how alchemical ideas were intertwined with Protestant views on human salvation and eschatology.

### Integration and Future Directions

The contributions of Janacek, Zuber, and Szulakowska highlight the multifaceted nature of early modern spiritual alchemy and suggest several directions for future research. Janacek’s contextual approach emphasizes the integration of alchemy with broader intellectual and political currents, while Zuber’s focus on continuity and transformation sheds light on the persistence of spiritual alchemy across periods. Szulakowska’s exploration of artistic and theoretical dimensions enriches our understanding of alchemy’s influence beyond the early modern period.

Future research could further explore the intersections of alchemy with other intellectual and cultural traditions, such as the influence of alchemy on early modern science, literature, and philosophy. Additionally, a comparative approach that examines alchemical traditions across different regions and cultures could provide new insights into the global dimensions of early modern alchemy.

In conclusion, the state of research on early modern spiritual alchemy reflects a dynamic and evolving field that continues to uncover new dimensions of this complex tradition. By integrating the insights of scholars like Bruce Janacek, Mike Zuber, and Urszula Szulakowska, we gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of how alchemy intersected with political, religious, and artistic currents in the early modern period. The ongoing exploration of alchemy’s diverse and multifaceted nature promises to yield further valuable insights into its historical and intellectual significance.</div>

### Bruce Janacek’s Contextual Analysis

In *Alchemical Belief: Occultism in the Religious Culture of Early Modern England*, Bruce Janacek presents a contextualized examination of alchemical beliefs within the political and religious upheavals of early modern England. Janacek argues that alchemical writings should be understood as part of a broader intellectual and devotional landscape rather than merely as scientific or medical texts. His study highlights how figures like Thomas Tymme, Robert Fludd, Francis Bacon, Sir Kenelm Digby, and Elias Ashmole engaged with alchemy to address the era’s political and theological conflicts. Janacek demonstrates that these alchemical writings were not isolated pursuits but were deeply intertwined with the authors&#x27; political loyalties and theological commitments.

Janacek’s work underscores that alchemy provided a framework for navigating and resolving the crises of the period. By placing alchemical writings within the broader context of early modern England’s political and religious life, Janacek reveals how alchemy was used to support national and royalist loyalties and address societal conflicts.
