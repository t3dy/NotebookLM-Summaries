| Introduction                 | Discusses the provenance and importance of Manuscript Sloane 3854, detailing its Latin translation of an Arabic Hermetic treatise on astral magic and its connections to Picatrix.                                                    | Highlights a rare combination of Hermetic, Latin, and Scandinavian elements, bridging Arabic astrological magic with European traditions.                                                                                                       | The manuscript reflects considerable textual corruption, deliberate reordering, and missing sections, complicating interpretation.                                                                                                                   | The manuscript serves as a bridge between Arabic, Latin, and Scandinavian magical traditions. | &quot;This book belongs to the spiritual works of Aristotle ... and is the ancient book of the seven planets.&quot;                           | Arabic source: Kitāb al-Istamāṭīs; Latin sources: Hermann of Carinthia, William of Auvergne.                                        |
| The Use of Runes             | Explores the incorporation of Scandinavian runes in astrological spells, including their cryptic names and association with planetary spirits.                                                                                       | Establishes the novel use of Scandinavian runes in medieval Italian manuscripts, showing their role in magical texts.                                                                                                                         | Identifies discrepancies and corruptions in the runic script and names, reflecting the scribe’s unfamiliarity or adaptation attempts.                                                                                                                 | Runes were used to encode magical names and link them to astrological and planetary forces.       | &quot;Runes should be used in place of Latin script ... to construct magical words.&quot;                                                      | Scandinavian runic traditions, medieval cryptography, and European magical texts.                                                  |
| Methodology and Analysis     | Describes methods for extracting rune figures from zodiacal divisions and assigning them celestial and elemental properties.                                                                                                           | Highlights a methodological approach connecting astrological configurations to rune usage, reinforcing interdisciplinary links between magic, astronomy, and runology.                                                                         | Relies heavily on reconstructed sequences and hypothetical connections due to missing and corrupted folios.                                                                                                                                            | The magical significance of runes derives from their celestial and elemental properties.           | &quot;Each of the runes has an elemental quality ... incorporated into the magical word constructed from it.&quot;                              | Medieval texts on geomancy and zodiacal divisions, as well as Scandinavian rune sources.                                           |
| Postscript (by M. Stoklund)  | Reviews the evidence for the Scandinavian runes, emphasizing their authenticity and their adaptation in the manuscript for Latin purposes.                                                                                            | Demonstrates the medieval adaptation of runic alphabets to fit the Latin script, reflecting cultural transmission.                                                                                                                              | Highlights the gap between the manuscript&#x27;s magical use of runes and their traditional Scandinavian context.                                                                                                                                            | Runes were adapted from Scandinavian tradition to align with Latin magical needs.                   | &quot;The names ... refer to &#x27;stung&#x27; runes and therefore prove an association with Scandinavian medieval runes.&quot;                          | Icelandic grammatical traditions, Danish Cyprianus books, and late medieval Scandinavian rune practices.                            |

| <strong>Manuscript Sloane 3854</strong>          | A 14th-century Italian manuscript containing Latin translations of Arabic magical texts and sections incorporating Scandinavian runes.                           | Central artifact of study, linking Hermetic traditions, astrological magic, and rune usage.                                                                       | Text is corrupted, incomplete, and disordered, requiring significant reconstruction and speculation. |
| <strong>Arabic Source: Kitāb al-Istamāṭīs</strong>| The source text translated into Latin; its influence is visible in planetary magic and zodiacal divisions described in the manuscript.                          | Provides the Hermetic and astral magic framework for the manuscript’s contents.                                                                                   | Only fragments are referenced, and the extent of fidelity to the Arabic original is unclear.          |
| <strong>Runes and Rune Names</strong>            | Scandinavian runes are referenced in cryptic magical formulas, including “stung” runes like *ystingen* and *bierbe stuncken*.                                    | Evidence of cultural transmission and the novel adaptation of Scandinavian runes into a Latin magical context.                                                    | Some runic figures are corrupted or misidentified, limiting precise analysis of their origins.        |
| <strong>Zodiacal and Planetary Associations</strong>| Divisions of the zodiac are linked to rune figures and planetary spirits, incorporating elemental and celestial qualities.                                       | Highlights the interplay between medieval astrology and magical practices using runes.                                                                            | System appears artificial, with names and divisions fabricated or loosely derived from tradition.     |
| <strong>Latin Magical Traditions</strong>        | References to Latin translations of Arabic magical works like Picatrix, used to create spells and rituals in the manuscript.                                     | Demonstrates the manuscript&#x27;s integration into broader European magical and astrological traditions.                                                              | Limited direct comparisons to other Latin magical texts.                                              |
| <strong>Scandinavian Rune Traditions</strong>    | Authentic rune names and forms, including pricked runes, align with medieval Scandinavian practices documented in inscriptions and grammatical works.            | Supports the claim that the runic material is based on real Scandinavian alphabets and traditions.                                                                | The connection between the manuscript’s use of runes and specific Scandinavian practices is tenuous.   |
| <strong>Later Magical Traditions</strong>        | Danish Cyprianus books and Icelandic spellbooks from the 1500s onward showing continued use of runes and runelike figures in magic.                             | Provides a broader historical context for the association of runes with magic in Northern European traditions.                                                     | The temporal gap makes direct influence or continuity speculative.                                    |
| <strong>Medieval Cryptographic Practices</strong>| Similar use of symbols, runes, and fictitious alphabets in magical and scientific manuscripts from medieval Europe.                                              | Suggests that the Sloane scribe’s use of runes may have been influenced by European cryptographic traditions rather than direct Scandinavian sources.              | Specific parallels with the manuscript’s figures are limited, making exact influences unclear.         |

| <strong>Cultural Transmission</strong>       | The movement and adaptation of ideas, symbols, and texts across cultures and geographies.                                                                                       | The integration of Scandinavian runes into a Latin manuscript reflects cultural exchange between Northern European and Mediterranean traditions.                                | The exact pathways of transmission are unclear due to textual corruption and lack of comparable examples in other manuscripts.                        |
| <strong>Textual Corruption</strong>          | Alteration, miscopying, or reordering of texts over time, leading to gaps or changes in meaning.                                                                                 | The Sloane manuscript exhibits disordered folios, missing sections, and corrupt rune names, complicating interpretation.                                                       | Reconstruction relies heavily on hypotheses, potentially distorting the original intentions of the text.                                             |
| <strong>Syncretism</strong>                  | The blending of different religious, cultural, or philosophical traditions into a unified system.                                                                                | Combines Hermetic magical practices, Latin astrological traditions, and Scandinavian runic elements into a single magical framework.                                            | The degree to which these elements were deliberately synthesized versus coincidentally combined remains ambiguous.                                     |
| <strong>Hermetic Tradition</strong>          | Philosophical and esoteric systems derived from writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, often involving astrology and magic.                                                | The manuscript’s planetary magic, zodiacal divisions, and invocation of spiritual forces align with Hermetic principles.                                                       | The adaptation of Hermetic ideas into the specific context of this manuscript is not fully explored.                                                 |
| <strong>Runology</strong>                    | The study of runes and their historical and cultural contexts.                                                                                                                  | Provides insights into the origin and adaptation of Scandinavian runes for use in the manuscript’s magical system.                                                             | Corrupted figures and names obscure the exact relationship to authentic Scandinavian practices.                                                      |
| <strong>Esotericism</strong>                 | Study of hidden or secret knowledge, often tied to mysticism, magic, and the occult.                                                                                            | The manuscript uses runes as esoteric symbols to encode magical names and rituals, reflecting their perceived mystical power.                                                   | Balancing esoteric interpretation with scholarly critique of textual authenticity can be difficult.                                                  |
| <strong>Astrological Determinism</strong>    | The belief that celestial bodies influence earthly events and human affairs, a key principle in medieval astrology and magic.                                                   | Links runic figures to zodiacal divisions and planetary spirits, assigning them elemental and celestial qualities.                                                              | The artificiality of the manuscript’s astrological-runic system raises questions about its consistency with traditional astrological frameworks.       |
| <strong>Cryptography in Magic</strong>       | The use of secret or coded alphabets to conceal mystical or magical meanings in texts.                                                                                          | Scandinavian runes are employed cryptographically to encode names of planetary spirits in the manuscript.                                                                      | Some runic figures appear invented or modified, reducing their cryptographic consistency and historical authenticity.                                 |
| <strong>Medieval Scholarly Networks</strong> | The transmission of knowledge through interconnected intellectual communities spanning geographic and cultural boundaries in the medieval period.                              | References to Hermetic texts, Arabic sources, and Scandinavian runes illustrate the wide reach of medieval intellectual exchange.                                               | The specific scribe’s access to Scandinavian rune traditions in 14th-century Italy is puzzling and undocumented.                                      |
| <strong>Historiographical Gaps</strong>      | Areas where evidence is lacking or interpretations remain speculative due to incomplete or ambiguous sources.                                                                   | Missing folios and corrupt sections of the manuscript limit definitive conclusions about the continuity and purpose of the runic and magical elements.                         | Raises broader questions about the reliability of medieval sources in reconstructing historical magical practices.                                    |

| <strong>Identification of Manuscript Context</strong>       | Places Sloane MS 3854 within the traditions of Latin translations of Arabic Hermetic texts and its unique incorporation of Scandinavian runes.    | Provides a clear historical framework and demonstrates cultural intersections.                                                        | Relies on speculative connections between Hermetic, Latin, and Scandinavian traditions without corroborating examples.                                                                                                                                            | Strong start, but connections between traditions require further substantiation.                                                                                          |
| <strong>Discussion of Textual Corruption</strong>           | Highlights disordered folios, missing sections, and corrupt textual elements, including rune figures and names.                                   | Accurately identifies challenges in interpreting the manuscript, acknowledging its incomplete and altered state.                       | Reconstruction efforts are heavily speculative, with limited external validation.                                                                                                                                                                               | Necessary acknowledgment of manuscript issues, though speculative reconstructions weaken the argument.                                                                    |
| <strong>Runic Analysis</strong>                             | Examines the runes’ forms, names, and their integration into magical rituals and associations with planetary spirits.                            | Provides detailed insights into the runes’ cryptographic and symbolic use in the manuscript.                                          | Misidentified or corrupted runic elements reduce confidence in claims about their exact origin and use.                                                                                                                                                     | Valuable analysis, though weakened by textual corruption and reliance on reconstructed names and figures.                                                                |
| <strong>Zodiacal and Astrological System</strong>           | Describes the manuscript’s division of zodiacal signs and their connection to rune figures and planetary forces.                                 | Links celestial, elemental, and magical systems, showing interdisciplinary connections.                                               | The system appears artificial and may reflect the scribe’s fabrication rather than traditional astrological or magical practices.                                                                                                                           | Insightful synthesis, though the artificiality of the system raises questions about its authenticity and broader relevance.                                                |
| <strong>Interpretation of Runes as Esoteric Tools</strong>  | Argues that runes were used as cryptographic symbols to encode magical names and enhance the mystical power of rituals.                          | Fits within broader esoteric traditions of the medieval period, showing the symbolic power of runes in a new context.                  | Overemphasizes the connection between runes and their esoteric use without sufficient evidence from comparable texts or traditions.                                                                                                                         | Persuasive argument for the manuscript’s intention, though external corroboration is needed for stronger validation.                                                      |
| <strong>Comparisons to Scandinavian Practices</strong>      | Suggests that the runes and their names in the manuscript derive from authentic Scandinavian medieval traditions.                                | Recognizes authentic elements like “stung” runes, linking the manuscript to real Scandinavian runic practices.                         | Specific connections between Scandinavian rune sources and the manuscript’s Italian scribe are speculative and remain unproven.                                                                                                                              | A reasonable hypothesis, but the lack of direct evidence weakens its plausibility.                                                                                         |
| <strong>Cultural Transmission Hypothesis</strong>           | Proposes that the manuscript reflects a synthesis of Arabic, Latin, and Scandinavian magical traditions.                                         | Highlights a fascinating intersection of cultural and intellectual traditions in medieval Europe.                                      | Fails to provide a clear mechanism or pathway for the transmission of Scandinavian runes to an Italian scribe in the 14th century.                                                                                                                         | Captivating argument, though the lack of evidence for transmission pathways leaves key questions unanswered.                                                              |
| <strong>Conclusion on Magical and Esoteric Purpose</strong> | Concludes that the manuscript integrates runes as part of a magical system to manipulate planetary forces through cryptographic means.           | Aligns with broader traditions of medieval esotericism and cryptographic practices.                                                   | The manuscript’s textual corruption and the artificiality of its magical system limit the conclusion’s applicability beyond this specific case.                                                                                                               | A plausible conclusion for the manuscript, though broader generalizations about medieval magic must be tempered by the unique and corrupted nature of this source.         |

| <strong>Planetary Magic</strong>                  | Involves invoking the spiritual forces associated with planets to achieve specific outcomes.                                                          | Central to the manuscript; includes naming planetary spirits, using runes to encode these names, and performing rituals aligned with planetary configurations.    | Arabic Hermetic texts (*Kitāb al-Istamāṭīs*), Latin magical traditions, astrological frameworks.                                | Missing sections hinder complete understanding of rituals and their execution.                                              |
| <strong>Use of Runes in Spells</strong>           | Employs Scandinavian runes as cryptographic symbols to encode magical names and amplify ritual potency.                                               | Runes represent the names of planetary spirits and serve as magical symbols replacing Latin script in ritual contexts.                                             | Scandinavian runic traditions, medieval cryptography, and esoteric practices.                                                 | Corruption and misidentification of runes limit definitive conclusions about their role and origin.                         |
| <strong>Zodiacal Associations</strong>            | Links constellations and zodiacal divisions to celestial and elemental properties, which are then incorporated into magical practices.                 | Rune figures are derived from zodiacal divisions and assigned elemental qualities, aligning them with planetary magic.                                            | Medieval astrology, geomantic traditions, Hermetic influences.                                                                | The artificiality of the zodiacal system raises questions about its consistency with established astrological traditions.     |
| <strong>Invocation of Spirits</strong>            | Calls upon spiritual forces to perform tasks or grant abilities, such as invisibility or influencing others.                                           | Instructions include preparing for the correct planetary alignments and reciting magical formulas to summon visible spirits.                                       | Hermetic magic, Latin magical traditions, and European spellbooks.                                                            | Instructions are incomplete, and parallels to similar rituals in other traditions are speculative.                          |
| <strong>Creation of Magical Alphabets</strong>    | Uses cryptographic alphabets (here, runes) to encode mystical and magical meanings, often tied to specific rituals or protective purposes.              | The manuscript’s adaptation of Scandinavian runes into a magical alphabet reflects this practice.                                                                 | Scandinavian rune systems, medieval cryptographic traditions, and magical alphabets from esoteric texts.                      | Runes are partially corrupted, and their connections to known magical alphabets are unclear.                                 |
| <strong>Elemental Magic</strong>                  | Assigns elemental properties (fiery, airy, watery, earthy) to runes or symbols to align them with specific magical effects or purposes.                | Each rune figure is tied to an elemental quality, which is incorporated into the magical system.                                                                  | Medieval geomantic and elemental traditions, Hermetic cosmology.                                                              | Limited explanation of how these elemental qualities are operationalized in rituals.                                        |
| <strong>Influence of Lunar Mansions</strong>      | Divides the zodiac into sections influenced by lunar mansions, which are used to determine magical timing and effects.                                 | The manuscript divides zodiacal signs into two or three parts, reminiscent of lunar mansion systems, though applied differently.                                  | Arabic astrological texts, medieval astrology, and zodiacal magic traditions.                                                 | Application deviates from established lunar mansion traditions, raising doubts about its origins and accuracy.               |
| <strong>Love and Invisibility Spells</strong>     | Provides specific magical recipes for gaining love or becoming invisible by manipulating spiritual forces.                                            | Instructions reference planetary alignments and recitation of magical formulas to achieve personal desires.                                                       | Medieval spellbooks, Hermetic magical traditions.                                                                             | Fragmentary text limits understanding of the full procedure and its underlying principles.                                  |
| <strong>Integration of Christian Elements</strong>| Includes Christian imagery and elements in some magical rituals, appearing in later sections of the manuscript.                                       | Reflects a shift from purely astrological and Hermetic elements to Christianized magical practices.                                                                | Christianized medieval magical traditions.                                                                                    | Sudden transition to Christian elements suggests possible additions from a later scribe or tradition.                       |

| <strong>Bierbe Stuncken</strong>| Watery                | Scorpio/Sagittarius (Alcharie, first part)       | Represents watery qualities; used in planetary rituals.                              | Likely derived from &quot;stung&quot; *bjarkan* rune (*bjarkan stunginn*).                                          | Textual corruption of the name and form limits clarity in its application.                                                |
| <strong>Bierbe Blesena</strong> | Fiery                 | Scorpio/Sagittarius (Alcharie, second part)      | Encodes fiery properties in magical practices.                                       | Connection to Scandinavian runes is unclear; may be fabricated.                                          | Lack of direct parallels to known rune traditions reduces interpretive confidence.                                        |
| <strong>Rether</strong>         | Fiery                 | Capricorn/Aquarius (Hanape, first part)          | Represents fiery qualities; associated with planetary spirits.                       | Name appears partially fabricated but may echo runic traditions.                                          | Elemental assignments diverge from traditional rune meanings, challenging interpretations.                                |
| <strong>Sol</strong>            | Earthy                | Capricorn/Aquarius (Hanape, second part)         | Encodes earthy qualities; complements Rether.                                        | Corresponds to *sol* rune but adapted for the manuscript’s magical framework.                             | Adaptation for magical purposes complicates its linkage to traditional rune functions.                                    |
| <strong>Tyr</strong>            | Earthy                | Aquarius/Pisces (Allioes, first part)            | Represents earthy qualities; used in planetary spirit rituals.                       | Clearly derived from *Tiwaz* rune, though the elemental association differs.                              | Elemental reassignment from traditional interpretations creates ambiguity in its magical role.                            |
| <strong>Ue</strong>             | Airy                  | Aquarius/Pisces (Allioes, second part)           | Encodes airy qualities; complements Tyr.                                             | Its origin is unclear; may be fabricated or highly modified.                                              | Fabrication or corruption of its name and form complicates interpretation.                                                |
| <strong>Zaziyr</strong>         | Watery                | Pisces/Aries (Rymbel, sole extraction)           | Represents watery qualities; used in constructing names of spirits.                  | Its form and name are obscure, with limited connections to Scandinavian traditions.                        | Highly speculative connection to any known runic or magical traditions.                                                   |
