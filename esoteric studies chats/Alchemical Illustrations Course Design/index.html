In the mornings, I went to lectures, visited the Uf\u0002zi, or the Bargello to marvel at\nDuccio\u2019s zigzagged cruci\u0002xions, the Christ\u2019s almond-shaped eyes closed\nin furrowed pain. I sketched and made notes. In the hot afternoons,\nI wandered around the city when everyone took their reposo or siesta.\nStrolling past the cheese shops that smelled of the \u201cfeet of the gods,\u201d\ninto the artisans\u2019 quarter where the paper of tempting marbleized\njournals sparkled with painted copper tips adorning scrolls, \u0003owers\nand foliage, I ambled past the Orsanmichele. Here Donatello\u2019s statues,\nsuspended in time, instructed passers-by about civil duty, Florentine\npride, and moral rectitude. But walking up to the San Miniato del\nMonte, a solid church with thick brick walls decorated with frescoes on\nthe inside and geometric marble mosaics on the outside, was a special\nexcursion. It was on as much of a mountain as one would \u0002nd outside\nof Florence, affording a view of Brunelleschi\u2019s dome and the red-tiled\nroofs of the city below.\nOne July day, after an ample lunch of pasta, olives, and salty tomato\nsauce to maintain my perpetually hungry adolescent metabolism, I\nwalked to San Minato, looking forward to the cool sanctuary and\nsalubrious perfume of the rose garden. Perspiring heavily in the hot\nTuscan sun as I ascended the hill, I began to feel odd. White dots\nappeared before my eyes, my stomach felt heavy, and the bright colors\nof the landscape turned faint and grey. I stumbled to a wall to rest,\nand I subsequently awoke to an elderly and ample Italian lady clad in\nblack wafting a bottle that smelled piercing and sharp under my nose.\n\u201cSal volatile, sal volatile,\u201d she kept repeating, and then \u201cbene, bene\u201d\nas my eyes \u0003uttered open. I was befuddled, yet gradually aware I had\nfainted, my shirt ripped and a long scrape down my side indicating\nmy fall against the wall. The awareness of pain from the scrape and\nthe contents of the bottle rapidly propelled me to consciousness. \u201cSal\nvolatile? Sal volatile? what is that?\u201d I thought. Then I realized, \u201cVolatile\nsalts . . . oh, smelling salts! Grazie, grazie, signora.\u201d\n\nPages 19:\n2\nchapter one\nAfter returning to my pensione, I thought about the restorative I had\nbeen offered. Smelling salts were something I had previously thought\nonly existed in Victorian novels, but then I also thought only tightly\ncorseted heroines were capable of fainting, not an American student\nwho was suffering from dehydration and heat stroke. From that day,\nI wondered what the source of the idea was that salts contained a\nvital principle that would restore consciousness. That thought led to\nthe writing of this book, which delineates the important cultural and\nscienti\u0002c origins and effects of salt chymistry in early modern England,\nand among other purposes, demonstrates the source of the idea of salt\nas a source of life and restoration.\nIn this work, I will\n1. Demonstrate the centrality of salt and salt chymistry to early\nchymistry and matter theory generally, and ask to what extent natural\nphilosophers and physicians in the seventeenth and eighteenth century\nconsidered salt fundamental to science and medicine.1 The term \u201csalt\u201d\nin the early modern period was a vague one, but usually encompassed a\ngroup of \u201csolid soluble, in\u0003ammable substances with characteristic tastes\u201d2\nand a crystalline structure. In the early modern period, as the historian\nNorma Emerton has commented \u201cas the instrument of the form, as\nembodiment of the generative seed and spirit, and as the transmitter\nof mineral qualities including crystallinity, salt became the formative\nprinciple par excellence.\u201d3 Some chymists, such as Joseph Duchesne\n(1544\u20131609), Johann Glauber (1604\u201370), and Nicaise La Febvre (1610 \u2013\n1669) claimed there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d or formative salt believed\nto be responsible for minerallogenesis and the formation of matter, or\nperhaps a source of the alkahest or universal dissolvent.4 I will delineate\n1\nMy use of the term chymical and chymistry throughout this book is quite deliberate,\nas it is anachronistic practice to make clear distinctions between alchemy and chemistry\nin the seventeenth century. Early modern \u201cchymists\u201d attempted to transmute metals\ninto gold, considered an alchemical practice, yet also performed other experiments\ninvolving mass balance or crystallographic analysis that would be considered \u201cchemical.\u201d For further analysis of this historiographic problem, see L.M. Principe and W.R.\nNewman, \u201cAlchemy vs. Chymistry: The Etymological Origins of a Historiographic\nMistake,\u201d Early Science and Medicine, 3 (1998), pp. 32\u201365.\n2\nJon Eckland, \u201cSalt\u201d, in The Incomplete Chymist: Being an Essay on the Eighteenth-Century\nChemist in His Laboratory with a Dictionary of Obsolete Chemical Terms of the Period, Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology, Number 33 (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian\nInstitute Press, 1975).\n3\nNorma Emerton, The Scienti\u0002c Interpretation of Form (Ithaca: Cornell University\nPress, 1984), p. 214.\n4\nJoseph Duchesne, The practise of chymicall, and hermeticall physicke, for the preservation of\n\nPages 20:\nthe context of salts\n3\nthese debates about salts\u2019 role in matter theory amongst the Paracelsian\nSchool as well as chymists such as Glauber, who were in\u0003uenced by\nthe work of Johann Baptista Van Helmont (1577\u20131634).\n2. Assert that salt chymistry provides a nexus for studying the interrelationships between chymistry, natural history, physiology, and medical\nsciences in the early modern period. My exploration of natural history\u2019s\nintersection with chemical investigation in early modern England, particularly amongst early Royal Society members, proved a ripe area to\nexplore the growing importance of the senses and experience as causes\nof intellectual change in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While\nthe concept of the Paracelsian tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury is\nimportant to consider in tracing the source of these ideas, I argue the\nwork of the physician Johann Van Helmont was at their base.\n3. Argue that analyzing to what extent the alchemical understanding of salts was modi\u0002ed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nis crucial to our understanding of the transition between alchemy and\nchymistry. To accomplish this task, I will determine to what extent conceptions of volatile salts were modi\u0002ed by a diminishing of interest in\nthe salt principle, and increasing emphasis upon acidic saline spirits as\nthe fundamental movers in chymistry, natural processes and medicine\nin the \u0002rst half of the eighteenth century. As Ecklund commented,\n\u201cin the eighteenth century salts gradually became to be thought of in\nterms of process, as, for example, the product of the reaction between\nacids and bases, acids and other salts, or between two salts, etc. Some\nchemists regarded acids . . . themselves as salts or at least some saline\nsubstances.\u201d5 Indeed, Chambers Cyclopaedia (1728) de\u0002ned salt as a\n\u201csimple acid substance.\u201d6 In the early eighteenth century, the formative\nqualities of volatile salts were also thought to be an aid to longevity.\nBefore oxygen was \u201cdiscovered,\u201d acidic saline spirits were perceived to\nbe the source of life\u2019s breath, revealing not only the origins of the idea\nof smelling salts, but early theories of respiratory physiology.\nhealth . . .

The chapter will also analyze Thomas\nSherley\u2019s (1638\u20131678) translation of Duchesne\u2019s contemporary Turquet\nde Mayerne, as well as the work of Johann Glauber which in\u0003uenced\nthe intellectual circle of Samuel Hartlib and Robert Boyle.\nFrederic Holmes\u2019 collection of essays investigates primarily eighteenth-century French salt chymistry in another light, as an experimental enterprise in its own terms, not as a mere \u201cpreparation\u201d for the\ntheories of Lavoisier.10 In contrast to Owen Hannaway\u2019s view of the\norigins of modern chymistry, Holmes claimed that eighteenth-century\nsalt chymistry was \u201cinvestigative rather than didactic, concerned more\nwith research and discovery than teaching and dissemination.\u201d11 Holmes\nalso claimed that because the experimental activity concerning salt chymistry displayed principles of specialization and the division of labor, it\nwas to be distinguished from the \u201cmore familiar categories of natural\nphilosophy,\u201d in which virtuosi dabble in several areas of investigation.12\nHolmes\u2019 work however primarily investigated French salt chymistry in\nthe Acad\u00e9mie Royale which was an organized activity sponsored by\nthe French state. In contrast, in England, chapter three of this book\nwill show that chymistry was rather more intimately connected to the\n\u201cvirtuosic dabblings,\u201d of the more loosely-organized Royal Society,\nlargely in natural history. Salt was seen by natural philosophers such as\nMartin Lister (1638\u20131711), Robert Moray (1609\u201373), Thomas Philipot\n(d. 1682), Nehemiah Grew (d. 1682), and Robert Boyle (1627\u201391) to be a\nprimeval principle or fundamental mover in processes usually described\nin natural history accounts, such as tides, volcanoes, meteorological\neffects, and plant respiration.\nThe effects of volatile salts (in early modern chymistry, those that\nhave an odor and were reactive to heat), particularly of vitriol (ferrous\nsulphate) and saltpeter (potassium nitrate also known as nitre) were at\nthe center of these studies in natural history.13 This may have been\nbecause the crystals of the salts of vitriol are large and prominent,\nand because sulphuric and nitric acids produced spectacular and often\n10\nFrederic L.

To indicate the pervasiveness of these\nbeliefs, appendix one provides a translation of Martin Lister\u2019s work\nDe Fontibus medicatis Angliae Exercitatio (1684) [Exercises on the healing\nsprings of England], which contains an extensive discussion of vitriol\nand early beliefs about volatile salts.\nFurther, as Dear has noted, the early Royal Society\u2019s \u201cstyle of presentation\u201d of natural philosophy with its wealth of circumstantial evidence\nand empirical detail \u201callowed no clear distinction to be made between\na \u2018natural historical\u2019 . . . and an \u2018experimental report.\u2019 \u201d14 True to this\nfashion, English experimental works of salt chymistry in the seventeenth\ncentury, not only in form, but in their content, were \u201cnatural historical.\u201d\nDetailed reports of the phenomena of natural history were accompanied\nby theories of salt chymistry as underlying explanations for observed\nevents. Ursula Klein\u2019s work has analyzed to what extent the chemical\nexperiments in Herman Boerhaave\u2019s (1668\u20131738) Elementae Chemiae\nrelated not only to experimental philosophy, but to experimental history\nand natural history.15 In a similar manner, an exploration of natural\nhistory\u2019s intersection with chemical investigation in early modern England is a ripe area to explore the growing importance of the senses\nand experience as causes of intellectual change in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries.\nThe salt principle was also a fundamental alchemical tenet, and in\nchapter four I analyze to what extent the alchemical understanding of\nsalts was modi\u0002ed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to contribute to our comprehension of the early modern transition between\nalchemy and chymistry. As Principe has noted,\nin the Paracelsian triad [of salt, sulphur, and mercury] the largely analogical, relative, and \u0003uid categories of the Mercury and Sulphur of\nthe dyad are made more rigid so that the tria prima becomes universal,\nconstant, primary, elemental bodies. For example, Quercetanus, one of\nthe most important early expositors of the Paracelsian tria prima, insists\nin his liber de priscorum philosophorum varae medicinae materia that Mercury,\n14\nPeter Dear, \u201cTotius en Verba: Rhetoric and Authority in the Early Royal Society,\u201d\nIsis 76, 2 ( June 1985), pp. 144\u201361, on p. 154.\n15\nUrsula Klein, \u201cExperimental history and Herman Boerhaave\u2019s chemistry of\nplants,\u201d Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 34, (2003), pp.\n533\u2013567.

Van Helmont believed that volatile salts composed the vital\nspirit or the breath of both animals and plants which was \u201cresolved in\nthe heart by fermentation into a salt air and enlightened by life.\u201d18 In\nother words, volatile salts were thought to compose a vital spirit made\nof arterial blood transformed in the heart by fermentation into a salt\nair that was expelled by breathing.19 Just as van Helmont thought that\nheated blood discharged its volatile salts into the air, Robert Boyle\nand his colleague Daniel Coxe (1640\u20131730) believed that volatile salts\n\u201cbeing received into the vast subtile \u0003uid [atmosphere] . . . becomes the\nInstrument of sundry remarkable effects and operations, not only in\nNatural, but also [in] Arti\u0002cial productions.\u201d20\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, interest in the salt principle\nbegan to decline. Belief in the salt principle diminished, \u201cas did interest\nin elements in general, in favor of a notion of a primeval or universal\nacid as a fundamental mover in natural processes, usually equated with\n16\nLawrence M.

I also will analyze the writings of Newtonian physicians such as\nBryan Robinson (1680\u20131754), Archibald Pitcairne (1652\u20131713), George\nCheyne (1671\u20131743) and Richard Mead (1673\u20131754) who posited a\n\u201cNewtonian physiology\u201d based on the premises in the Principia, as well\nas queries in Newton\u2019s Opticks and the De Natura Acidorum. Although\nAnita Guerrini pioneered the studies of \u201cNewton-struck\u201d physicians\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, her emphasis\nwas primarily in the application of Newtonian physics to medicine;\nI will concentrate upon Newton\u2019s chymical works and their in\u0003uence\nin the medical community.23 Chapter \u0002ve will examine the spread of\nthese medical concepts of salt chymistry in larger society, looking at\ntheir role in patent medicines, in satire, and in medical treatments to\npromote longevity.\nBy the eighteenth century, we will see that suggestions for the identity of this universal acid re\u0003ected the \u201cnovel preoccupations . . . of the\nphlogiston theory, the nature of combustion, pneumatic chymistry, and\nrespiration;\u201d Lavoisier, for example, \u201cfastened upon the elementary\ngas, which he named oxygen (literally acid generator) as his acidifying\nprinciple.\u201d24 In the concluding chapter, I will brie\u0003y demonstrate this\n21\nMulthauf, Neptune\u2019s Gift, p. 130.\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 184.\n23\nAnita Guerrini, \u201cThe Tory Newtonians: Gregory, Pitcairne, and their Circle,\u201d\nJournal of British Studies, 25 (1986), pp. 288\u2013311; Anita Guerrini, \u201cArchibald Pitcairne\nand Newtonian Medicine,\u201d Medical History, 31 (1987), pp. 70\u201383; Anita Guerrini,\nObesity and Depression in the Enlightenment: The Life and Times of George Cheyne (Norman:\nUniversity of Oklahoma Press, 2000).\n24\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 227.\n22\n\nPages 26:\nthe context of salts\n9\ntheoretical progression, my analysis of this progression used to elucidate the staggered and incomplete development of chymistry from\nalchemical beliefs, one of the key historiographic issues in the study of\nearly modern chymistry.25 Finally I hope that I will have answered my\nquestion, formulated a long time ago in Tuscany, about why salt was\nthought to be a vital element.\n25\nNewman and Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. chymistry: The etymological origins of a\nhistoriographic mistake,\u201d passim.\n\nPages 27:\nCHAPTER TWO\nPARACELSIAN CONCEPTS OF SALTS\nAristotelian analyses of the elements in his On the Heavens and Of\nMeteorology dominated conceptions of matter in late medieval natural\nphilosophy. The heavens above the moon were created of the ether, a\nperfect shining element whose natural motion was circular and perfect.\nBelow the moon, there were the corruptible earth, air, \u0002re and water\nelements composing the material world. Each element was classi\u0002ed as\neither being hot or cold, and wet or dry. The heavy earth element had a\nnatural motion downwards towards the center of the earth, as Aristotle\npostulated elements teleologically strove to be in their natural place with\ntheir identical components of matter. Water also went down towards\nthe oceans, just as rain fell down out of the sky. Fire strove upwards to\nbe towards the ring of \u0002re thought to be surrounding the earth above\nits atmosphere; the upward motion of a burning candle illustrated this\nprinciple. Elemental air also went up towards the atmosphere. Each of\nthese elements was paired with its opposite element which had a natural\nmotion in a direction contrary to its own. Water, which was heavy and\nwet, was paired with \u0002re, which was light and dry; the heavy and dry\nearth found its opposite in the light and wet air.\nThe sun was also responsible for the generative properties of the four\nelements, aiding them by its heat and light to mix and create minerals,\nplant and animal life. Aristotle postulated in his geocentric astronomical\nsystem that the sun was not in the center of the universe, but rather\nin the midst of all the other planets. The sun could radiate light in all\ndirections, essential because Aristotle believed that the generation and\ncorruption, or becoming and passing-away, of all sublunar creatures\nand elements was dependent on the Sun.1 Robert Grosseteste, the late\nmedieval scholar and Bishop of Lincoln, expressed a common opinion when he stated that if the Sun were elevated to the region of the\n1\nAristotle, \u201cOn Generation and Corruption,\u201d in The Complete Works of Aristotle. 2\nvols. ed Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 2.10.336b, lines\n16\u201324; quoted in Edward Grant, Planets, Stars, and Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200 \u20131687\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 453.\n\nPages 28:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n11\nprimum mobile, the elements and compounds around the earth would\nbe destroyed because the earth\u2019s heat would be reduced.2 If the Sun\ndescended to the region of the Moon, its proximity to the elements of\nearth, water, air, and \u0002re would also destroy them. As it was, when near\nthe earth, the sun caused the waters surrounding the earth to evaporate,\nbut when it receded those waters condensed and fell.\nAs has been well documented by Debus and Pagel, Auroleus Phillipus\nTheostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim or Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) challenged these Aristotelian conceptions of the elements in the sixteenth\ncentury. Hellenistic alchemical texts posited that mercury and sulphur\nwere the basic elemental principles, and Paracelsus added salt to this,\ncreating the tria prima or three principles.3 While Paracelsus had no\ndesire to dispose of the Aristotelian schema of earth, air, water, and\n\u0002re, he did feel that they were purely \u201cspiritual in nature and only crude\napproximations of the objects by which we call these names.\u201d4 And,\nwhen Paracelsus added the tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury, this\nsecond elementary system of matter, he failed to\nmake clear the relationship of the new triad to the traditional elements.\nVarying between spiritual and material interpretations, the elements and\nprinciples were often pictured as often inde\u0002nable aspects of a primal stuff\nthat had to exist as a basis for the more complex things of this world.5\nThis state of affairs meant that sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nEnglish chymists integrated the Aristotelian and Paracelsian schemas\nas they saw necessary, coming up with different numbers of elements\nand principles to suit their needs. This chapter will explore how coexistence of elements and principles in\u0003uenced conceptions of the salt\nprinciple among Paracelsian chymists in England in the \u0002rst half of\nthe seventeenth century.\nIn this contextual chapter for our study of early modern saline chymistry, not only will we explore to what extent the material conception\n2\nRobert Grosseteste, Hexa\u00ebmeron, ed.

We\nwill \u0002rst examine Thomas Tymme\u2019s translation of Joseph Duchesne\u2019s\nPractice of Chymicall and Hermeticall Physick (1605), the \u0002rst work in England to explore such debates, as well as the signi\u0002cance of salt in the\nParacelsian system to an English audience. We will then also compare\nDuchesne\u2019s ideas about the medical use of salts to those of Turquet de\nMayerne, a French Paracelsian, who bound up in the antimony wars\nin France, emigrated to become a physician to Charles I of England.\nFinally, we will analyze the role of salt in the work of Johann Glauber\n(1604\u201370), the German chymist whose ideas were in\u0003uential in the\nintellectual circle in England centered about scienti\u0002c reformer Samuel\nHartlib (1600\u20131662) in the 1640s until the Restoration.6\nJoseph Duchesne and Thomas Tymme\u2019s\nPractice of Chymicall Physick\nJoseph Duchesne (1544\u20131609, known as Quercetanus) was a French\ncourt physician to Henry IV, and was considered \u201cas one of the leading\nauthorities on the new chemical medicines in Europe.\u201d7 Renowned and\nrebuffed for his chymical remedies, Duchesne was involved in public\ncontroversy within and without the French court, including successfully\ndefending Louise Robot, the Mademoiselle de Martinville, and her\nmother-in-law involving charges of incest.8 Duchesne\u2019s notoriety as well\nas his chymical theories caused English minister Thomas Tymme to\ntranslate his Libert de Priscorum Philosophorum verae medicinae material (1603)\nand the Ad Veritatem Hermeticae Medicinae ex Hippocratis vertumque decretis ac\nTherapeusi (1604) to create the Practice of Chymicall and Hermeticall Physick\n6\nJ.T.

In doing so, Tymme produced the \u0002rst treatise in England that\nwas devoted to Paracelsian theory since Richard Bostocke\u2019s Paracelsian\napology, the Difference between the auncient Phisicke . . . and the latter Phisicke\n(1585).9 The Practice was not only one of the \u0002rst seventeenth-century\ntreatises in English to have a complete explanation of Aristotelian and\nParacelsian elements, but it was the \u0002rst to have an extended discussion\nof the Paracelsian salt principle. Duchesne\u2019s work also was popularized\nin the \u0002rst half of the seventeenth century, in\u0003uencing more practical\nworks of Paracelsian medicine and chymistry such as John Woodall\u2019s\nSurgeon\u2019s Mate (1617).\nConsidering the muddied state of affairs created by the overlay of the\ntria prima unto the Aristotelian elemental system, it is not surprising that\nDuchesne created his own theoretical system, using a matrix of \u0002ve\nprinciples with both Paracelsian and Aristotelian elements.10 In Le Grand\nmiroir de Monde (1584) and the Defensio (1605), Duchesne had eliminated\nair as an element as he believed it was rari\u0002ed water, and disregarded\n\u0002re as well because it was not mentioned in Genesis, leaving earth,\nwater, salt, sulphur and mercury as his \u0002ve principles.11 To confuse\nthe issue further, Tymme in his translation modi\u0002ed Duchesne\u2019s ideas,\ninstead emphasizing a Trinitarian correspondence between the \u201cpassive\u201d\nAristotelian elements of earth, \u0002re, and water (which included terrestrial water and the upper waters of air), with the chymically \u201cactive\u201d\nParacelsian elements of salt, sulphur, and mercury. Debus is correct to\nsurmise that Tymme\u2019s emphasis on the trinity of matter was because\nof his vocation as a minister\u2014he attributed mystical properties to the\ntrinities of chemistry and religion.\nHowever, despite Tymme\u2019s Trinitarian thrust, one which will extend to\nthe classi\u0002cation of saline substances themselves, it cannot be overlooked\nthat salt emerges as an overwhelmingly predominant principle in his\ntranslation. Part one of the Practice is devoted to \u201cchymicall\u201d physick, and\ncontains three chapters about the material nature of salts. The entire\nsecond part and most of the third concerns the \u201chermeticall\u201d or spiritual\nnature of the \u201chermaphroditical\u201d salt, an \u201cideal Platonic form of salt.\u201d\nChemists like Duchesne, as well as Johann Glauber (1604\u201370), and Nicaise\nLa Febvre (1610\u20131669) claimed that there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d\n9\nAllen G.

There were several contenders for the identity of this formative salt principle including nitre,\nantinomy, and vitriol, the debates about which we shall analyze.\nPart one of the Practice:\nSalts, material substance, and the secondary qualities of taste and color\nPart one of the Practice devoted to chymical analysis began by describing the material nature of salt. It was seen as a \u201cdry body, merely\nearthy . . . endowed with wonderfull virtues of dissolving, congealing,\ncleansing,\u201d and as the substantive body in the trinity of spirit (mercury)\nand soul (sulphur); this concept was taken from Duchesne\u2019s Ad veritatem.12\nAnd, Tymme\u2019s classi\u0002cation was in keeping with the Paracelsian tria\nprima, in which \u201csalt is the directive for matter to assume solidity and\nbodily shape.\u201d13 Continuing the tripartite theme, all salts were believed\nto contain within themselves salty, sulphureous, and mercurial qualities\n\u201cjointly together.\u201d Common earthy salt, \u201c\u0002xed and \u0002rme,\u201d nitrous salt,\n\u201cpartly \u0002xed and partly volatile,\u201d participating in the \u201csulphureous\nbeginnings of things,\u201d and sal ammoniac, which was \u201cof the Mercuriall\nbeginning spiritual and airie\u201d could all be extracted from any saline\nsubstance by a \u201cwittie\u201d saltmaker with the \u201cforce of \u0002re.\u201d14\nTymme also claimed that salts also were responsible for secondary\nqualities of matter, such as color or taste. It was also possible to discern\nwhich type of salt in a sample was predominant, whether sulphureous,\n\u0002xed, or mercurious, by taste. Earthy \u0002xed salt had a simple salt taste,\nnitrous or sulphureous salt a sweet and oily one, and mercurial salt was\nsour. In fact, a substance without any salt, such as water, was described\nby Tymme as \u201cutterly unsavory.\u201d15 This belief that water was tasteless\nwas ultimately derived from Aristotle\u2019s On Sense and the Sensible,16 in which\n12\nJoseph Duchesne, (1605) The practice of chymicall and hermeticall physicke, trans.

These predominant salt, sweet, or sour\ntastes which derived from salty, sulphureous, or mercurial salts in any\nsubstance, the Practice argued, are attenuated by mixture with the \u201cpassive\u201d Aristotelian qualities of earth, \u0002re, and water.17 Tymme wrote:\nfor the sharpe is mixed with a mercurial liquor; the sower is mixed with a\nphlegmatique, or watery humour, and the eger, with a terrestrial driness:\nthe which, the more they have of the Elementary qualities, and the same\npassive, so much the more weake they are and impaired.18\nHowever, by chymical art, the active salts could be separated from\nthe passive elements, and \u201cobtaine their full force,\u201d for medicinal\npurposes.19\nIn a simpler vein, \u201ccookery\u201d could also be used to change tastes of\nsubstances, as heat would volatilize the differing salts in the food. For\ninstance,\nSo if thou shalt drawe out of onions and garlicke a Volatile and aiery\nsharpe Mercurial Salt, which ariseth in the super\u0002cies &amp; uppermost of\ntheir bodies: thou shalt make them more sweet and pleasing, and to put\noff their sharpenesse, by which they bite the tongue.20\nIn other words, the sweetness of the cooked onions and garlic was\nbecause the marine salt and sulphureous salt were left behind after\nheating, lending their qualities of taste to the cooked food.\nThis premise that taste arises from a proportion of salts mixed with\npassive elements was a Paracelsian challenge to the Aristotelian-scholastic,\nand hence Galenic idea that taste was due to the hot, cold, moist, and\ndry qualities of the substance in question. Aristotle believed heat and\ncold were among the most fundamental features of matter in the secondary realm, including that of taste, digestive savor in the mouth, and\nnutritional value. In the On Sense and the Sensible, taste and savor increased\nin direct proportion with heat, whereas \u201ccoldness and freezing render\nSavors dull, and abolish odours altogether; for cooling and freezing\ntend to annul the kinetic heat which helps to fabricate sapidity.\u201d In the\nAristotelian scheme, moistness also increased strength of taste. But for\nTymme and Duchesne, the proportion of salts was behind the sensory\nappreciation of food.\n17\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

D4 verso.\n18\n\nPages 33:\n16\nchapter two\nAnother challenge to scholastic assumptions was the Practice\u2019s argument that saline spirits were behind the diversity of color in mineral,\nvegetable and animal matter, a belief we shall see in chapter three that\n\u0002fty years later will in\u0003uence theories in the Royal Society about plant\npigments. Scholastics believed that color was related to the material\u2019s\nhot and cold qualities. This stemmed from Aristotle\u2019s belief that hotness and coldness were among the most fundamental characteristics of\nmatter in the sublunary area, something later mechanists would deny.21\nAristotle also promoted a causal thesis of perception, or that \u201cthe\ncapacity of a sensible quality to produce perception has as its basis the\nintrinsic nature of the quality;\u201d when applied to color, this meant that\nthe inherent quality of a red object makes us perceive it as red.22 And,\nthe object\u2019s inherent quality of redness also meant the object had an\ninherent quality of hotness as well. Whiteness usually meant the object\nalso had an inherent quality of coldness, like snow. Thus, as Tymme\nnoted, the scholastic\nPhysitians . . . have . . . noted certain frivolous and light observations: as\nwhen they say, that in a white onion, or in white wine, a man may judge\nby the color a great coldnesse, than in a red onion or in red wine.23\nIn contrast, Paracelsians argued that \u201csolidity and often color were due\nto salt.\u201d24 Tymme noted that arsenic, which is a white sublimate, and\nthus should be cold, instead was very biting to the taste (a hot quality).\nFurther, white sugar when heated, revealed \u201cits innermost spirits,\u201d and\nbecame sharp in taste, its \u201cwaters\u201d dissolving metal, also symptomatic\nof hot qualities. This refutation of Aristotelian principles meant that\ncolor proceeded from \u201cthe spirits . . . or aery vapours, which lye hid in\nthe Salt,\u201d and was not related to heat or cold at all.25 As an example\nof this, Tymme utilized Saltpeter or Nitre. Nitre was also white, but\nwhen heated, dyed the body of the alembic colors \u201cof no less variety,\nthen are \u0003owers of the earth in the time of the Spring.\u201d26\n21\nTodd Stuart Ganson, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong with the Aristotelian Theory of Sensible\nQualities,\u201d Phronesis XLII, 3, (1997), pp. 263\u2013282, on p. 264.\n22\nGanson, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong,\u201d p. 276.\n23\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

E1 verso.\n\nPages 34:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n17\nJust as salts were behind colors and tastes of substances, Tymme\nargued in the Practice that the very substance of matter could be reduced\nto salts, and he utilized experiments with wine and its vinegar to do\nso. It was \u0002rst postulated that salts could be volatilized by exposing\nthe substances in which they were contained to \u201ccelestial in\u0003uences,\u201d\nsuch as sunlight. Via an elaborate system of astral parallels, Paracelsus\nhad taught that celestial in\u0003uences at the macrocosmic level in\u0003uenced\nthe microcosm of the body, as well as causing chemical change in the\ninanimate world. Taking Paracelsus\u2019 idea in consideration, Tymme\nwrote that the celestial in\u0003uence of the sun could reveal hidden salts\nthat made up matter, as in the case of wine exposed to sunlight turning\nto vinegar. He claimed that sun \u201cvaporeth\u201d away the wine\u2019s quintessence, and\nthis eternal and celestial essence being gone, which was the cause of the\nwines sweetnes (which sweetnes hath alwaeies joined with it neverthelesse,\na certain pricking very acceptable to the palate, by reason of a singular\ntemper of sharpnesse Vitriolated by sweete and Sulphurus spirits, put by\nthe instinct of nature into wine) at the length it waxeth sower.27\nThe sourness and sharpness of vinegar had nothing to do with its\nsupposed cold qualities, but to the \u201chidden . . . spirits of Salt,\u201d whose\nsourness was revealed when sulphureous salts were volatilized away\nby sunlight.\nTymme would further test the saline constitution of vinegar using\ndistillation. Distilling three pints of vinegar revealed \u0002rst watery phlegm\nwithout taste. After this phlegm was drawn away, sharp liquor remained,\nwhich Tymme identi\u0002ed as containing sal ammoniac, or ammonium\nchloride. Tymme may have obtained this observation from Duchesne\u2019s\nAd Veritatem Hermeticae Medicinae (1604) in which he had argued sal\nammoniac was closely linked to the mercurial element, and that distilling substances that contained sal ammoniac would result in a mercurial\nwater that was sharp and biting in taste.28 Whatever the source of this\n27\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

As Tymme\ncommented, \u201cfrom this \u0002xed Marine salt, as from the Father and \u0002rst\noriginal, all other sates [saltes] are derived.\u201d31\nPart two of the Practice:\nSalts, \u0002re analysis and the existence of the philosophical salt\nThe idea that distillation would separate a salt into its own constituent\nproperties of \u0002xed, sulphureous, and mercuric qualities was not only was\na re\u0003ection of the Paracelsian idea that substances cannot be divided\ninto more than three substances, but that distillation itself would reveal\nthe base principles of matter. The ef\u0002cacy of \u0002re analysis or distillation\nwas an idea in some dispute in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.32\nParacelsians believed that vaporous fumes in distillation revealed mercury, \u0003ame sulphur, and ashes salt.33 However, as Debus and Shakelford\nhave shown, opponents of Paracelsus such as Erastus believed that \u0002re\nchanged bodies into material that was not part of original bodies, and\nthat heat created new compounds, rather than revealing the building\nblocks of a substance.34\nIn chapter 10 of the Practice, the Paracelsian Tymme railed against\nthinkers like Erastus, stating that in the case of the calcinations of\nsalts, \u201cthe naturall and original moysture in Saltes is not consumed.\u201d35\nHis proof lay in the results of palingenesis, in which one took a plant,\nbruised and burnt it, and then calcinated its ashes, extracting from it\na volatile salt. One then made a compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat; arising from the ashes were salt crystals which\nresembled a stem, leaves and \u0003owers, an apparition of the plant which\nhad been submitted to combustion.36 Although the salt had been reduced\n31\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

Tymme\u2019s interest in plant ashes also symbolized a general trend\nin chymistry. As Ahonen has remarked, although early iatrochymists\nhad a bias towards distillates, the later Paracelsians [such as Duchesne,\nTymme] . . . and Glauber . . . were slowly overcoming the entrenched distaste for residues and extending their chymistry to the appreciation as well\nof the \u0002xed salts that remained behind in the ashes. This was to open up\na whole new \u0002eld of salts (e.g., the nitrates and sulphates).37\nTymme also utilized the example of experiments done by Sieur de Luynes\nor de Formentieres to extract salt from metals via calcination to show\nthat salts were not changed in their composition by the heat of the\n\u0002re. These metallic salts were\nmixed with lye made with ashes of burnt metals, by often powring warme\nwater upon the same, &amp; drawing it through too and againe shewing a\nproofe of his essence, included in the lye after this manner.38\nThe lye was strained through a \u0002lter, cleansed with water, and then\nplaced in a vessel and exposed to the air, whereupon \u201cthere appeared\na thousand forms of mettalls, with all the parts thereto belonging, as\nleaves, stalks, and rootes . . . in such sort as no man could be acknowledge\nthem to be mettals.\u201d39 The precipitation of salts from the lye which\nresembled metallic shapes con\u0002rmed to Tymme that the essence of\nmetallic forms was inherent in the salty ashes, and \u0002re did not destroy\nthis essence. Inspired by biblical text, he then commented, \u201cRemember\nman, that thou art Ashes, and to Ashes againe shalt returne.\u201d40 This\nreasoning was not unique. As Newman has shown, the sixteenth-century\nartist and chymist Bernard Palissy, also in\u0003uenced by Paracelsian ideas,\nbelieved salt\u2019s crystallizing activity showed that it was behind the production of minerals and metals.41\nalchemy and metempsychosis in renaissance medicine,\u201d Ambix 26, 2 ( July 1979), pp.\n81\u201399; A.G.

As Renaissance\nNeo-Platonism proposed there was an imperfect physical, and a perfect\nspiritual reality, Tymme also believed that while there were imperfect\nmaterial salts that contributed tastes and color to material objects, there\nwas also a philosophical or spiritual salt which was animate, hermaphroditical and thus inherently reproductive. In promoting this dualism,\nTymme was re\u0003ecting the entirely typical nature of alchemists to make\nvague distinctions between material principles and their more exalted\nspiritual realities. There had also been a long medieval alchemical tradition \u201cconcerning the exalted dignity of salt as the basic operational force\nin Nature,\u201d and Duchesne and his translator expressed that tradition\nstemming from Raymond Lull\u2019s corpus of sal in rebus omnibus.42\nTymme wrote that within the plant ash there was also a spiritual salt,\na spiritual \u201cIdea, indued with a spirituall essence: which served for no\nother purpose, but to be matched with his \u0002tting earth, that so it might\ntake unto it a more solid body.\u201d43 This existence of this spiritual salt was\nalso shown by the fact that salt was a \u201cbalsam of nature.\u201d Tymme wrote,\n\u201call creatures by a certain natural instinct, doe desire [salt] as a Balsam,\nby which they are preserved, conserved, &amp; doe grow and increase.\u201d44\nBirds and doves sought it out \u201cwith their beaks,\u201d deer gravitated to\nsalt licks, and \u0002sh were \u201cbred and nourished\u201d in the sea.45 Spiritual\nsalts also were generative; salt was said to awake the power of semen,\nand Venus \u201cthe mother and \u0002rst beginner of generation, is begotten\nof the Salt spume or froath of the male;\u201d salt was also thought to be\nresponsible for the generation of pearls and corals in the sea as the\nbranching nature of the coral suggested salt crystals.46 Fertilizing salts\nin marl \u201canimateth, forti\u0002eth, and giveth power\u201d to the earth; as the\nsun caused the volatile salts in wine to vaporize and manifest chymical\nchange, the sun in the springtime elevated and sublimated \u201cthe spirits of\nthe said Salt, and of the balsam of Nature.\u201d47 Salts in the air released\nby sunbeams fell again in the form of dew which contained \u201cthe spirit\n42\nPagel, Smiling Spleen, p. 41.\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

Aristotle\u2019s \u201cworks\ninvolved pairs of opposing qualities, especially hot and cold, moist and\ndry,\u201d and these qualities were analogically connected to solar and lunar\nin\u0003uences on the earth and the human body.48 In On Generation and\nCorruption, he wrote that the sun releases heat which effects generation\nof life on earth.49 However, because the sun was made of a perfect\nand immutable \u0002fth element or aether, the sun\u2019s heat was attributed\nto its motion only, because the heat and light which it emitted were\n\u201cengendered as the air was chafed by . . . its movement.\u201d50 In the body,\nAristotle associated the \u201chot\u201d motive quality of the sun with the masculine vital heat or active \u201csoul-principle\u201d of the semen. The source of\nthe vital heat of the semen was the pneuma, which was \u201canalogous to\nthe element which belongs to the stars,\u201d or the divine \u0002fth element or\naether; the pneuma was analogous to aether is that it was generative,\nbecause the Sun, which was also made of aether, was a means of\ncreation.51 Aristotle thus concluded that\nthe heat of the sun does effect generation, and so does the heat of\nanimals . . . which operates through the semen. The physical part of the\nsemen, which . . . is accompanied by the portion of soul-principle and\nacts as its vehicle . . . [enters] the uterus . . . [and] it sets the residue produced by the female and imports to it the same movement with which\nit is itself endowed.52\nOther English Paracelsian physicians such as Thomas Moffet also connected salts to lusty behavior. Thomas Moffett (1553\u20131604) studied\nmedicine at Basel, wrote a manuscript on entomology which was pub48\nJoan Cadden, Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1996), p. 21.\n49\nAristotle, \u201cOn Generation and Corruption,\u201d in The Complete Works of Aristotle. 2\nvols. ed Jonathan Barnest (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 2.10.336b,\nlines 16\u201324.\n50\nAristotle, On the Heavens, trans.

Moffett had also written the preface of the of\u0002cial pharmacopoeia of the London College of Physicians\nthat was devoted to Paracelsian chymical remedies.53 If we examine\nMoffet\u2019s works on diet\u2014the Health\u2019s Improvements or Rules Comprising and\nDiscovering the Nature, Method, and Manner of Preparing all Sorts of Food Used\nin this Nation\u2014we see that he claimed:\nExperience teacheth, that Mice lying in Holes laden . . . with Salt, breed\nthrice faster there, then if they were laden with other Merchandize. Huntsmen likewise and shepherds seeing a slowness of lust in their Dogs and\nCattle, feed them with Salt means to hasten coupling; and what maketh\nDoves and Goats so lusty and lascivious that they desire to feed upon\nsalt things. Finally remember, that lechery (in Latin) is not idlely or at\nadventure termed Salaritus, Saltishness, or every man knows that the\nsalter our humours be, the more prone and inclinable we are to lechery.\nWherefore whosoever coveteth to be freed of that \u0002re . . . let them altogether abstaine from Salt.54\nAfter establishing that salt was inherently generative, Tymme then went\non to postulate which salt in particular exempli\u0002ed this formative and\nspiritual salt principle, and decided that nitre, particularly an aerial\nnitre (in modern terms, potassium nitrate), was the best candidate.\nParacelsus said that nitre arose \u201cfrom the union of urine and the\nuniversal natural balsam,\u201d that nitre was uniquely able to bring about\nmany of the Arcana of alchemy.55 While Paracelsus\u2019 followers such as\nPeter Severinus, English chymist Robert Bostocke, and Gerard Dorn\nassociated nitre with the vital sulphur, ens astrale or summa vitalis, any\nsixteenth-century references to an aerial nitre were con\u0002ned to plague\nmiasmas or to a theory of thunder and lightening involving the explosive force of gunpowder. As Parthington, Guerlac, and Debus have\nillustrated, it was not until the seventeenth century that the belief in a\n53\nAllen Debus, \u201cParacelsus: Five Hundred Years, Three American Exhibits at the\nNational Library of Medicine,\u201d http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_2.html.

Ammonia from the decomposition of\nurea in dung heaps would produce nitrate, and nitre-beds were cultivated in the early modern period by mixing manure and ashes, along\nwith straw to create a compost pile; the compost pile was periodically\nkept moist with urine and leached with water. The liquid containing\nthe nitrates was then converted with ashes to potassium nitrates which\nwere re\u0002ned into gunpowder. Tymme postulated that since nitre was\npartially extracted from of earth, usually taken out of old stables, it had\na mineral quality. Because it also came from \u201chints of grounds which\nhave been replenished with salt liquor,\u201d nitre also had animal origins.\nFinally, since \u201curines are nothing else, but a super\u0003uous separation of\nthe Salt of vegetables, by which living creatures are nourished,\u201d nitre\nhad a vegetable nature.58 Because vegetables absorbed nitre from the\nsoil, especially in their roots, medicines distilled from vegetable matter\nwould also contain a gentler saline medicament and purge; the salts\n\u201cwere not altogether so violent, and of so homogenous a spirit, as they\nwere in their . . . original.\u201d59\nTymme also claimed that nitre was hermaphroditical, \u201cmale and\nfemale: \u0002xed and volatile, Agent and Patient, and which is more, hot\nand cold: \u0002er and Ice, but mutual friendship and sympathie joined in\none.\u201d60 Very \u0002ne gold and silver will dissolve in solutions of nitric acid\ncontaining chlorine, and virtually all soil contains signi\u0002cant quantities\nof chloride salts; since alchemists attributed male and female qualities\nto gold and silver, a substance that could dissolve both also seemed to\ncontain a unity of opposites. Like all other salts, nitre also had within\nitself \u0002xed, as well as volatile, sulphureous and mercurial qualities.

Tymme thus claimed, \u201cPlato writeth,\nthat this Salt, is a friend and familiar to divine things.\u201d61\nIndeed, this philosophical salt not only was behind the structure of\nthe sublunary world, but postulated to be part of the fabric of heaven.\nIn Chapter XII of the Practice, which was devoted to Genesis, Tymme\nclaimed that out of the Chaos, the tria prima was formed. Tymme\nwrote,\nThis was the worke of God, that he might separate and pure from the\nimpure; that is to say, that he might reduce the more pure and ethereal\nMercury, the more pure and inextinguible Sulphur, the more pure, and\nmore \u0002xed salte, into shyning and inextinguible Starres and Lights, into\na Christalline and Dyamantine Substance.62\nIn other words, the \u201c\u0002xed Heavens, or Vitriall and Chrystallyne circles,\nis a salt body,\u201d which had was so shining and pure that a \u201cDiamond,\nwhich partaketh of the nature of \u0002xed salt, is not of more puritie,\ncontinuance, and perpetuitie than they are.\u201d63 This is another example\nof the integration of the Aristotelian system with the Paracelsian; the\nAristotelian \u0002fth element or ether, described by a \u0002fteenth-century\nEnglish encyclopedia as \u201cresplendour perpetual . . . so clear and shining\u201d which composed the crystalline orbital spheres of the planets, has\nbeen transformed into the philosophical salt principle.64 As salt was the\n\u201cfoundation of the whole frame\u201d of the microcosm of man, his very\n\u201cbones, sinews, and ligaments\u201d composed of saline substance, so was\nsalt the framework of the macrocosm of the heavens.65\nSalts and Disease in Paracelsian Medicine\nThese concepts of physical and spiritual salts were not con\u0002ned to\ntheoretical chymical tracts, but appeared in works devoted to practical Paracelsian medicine.

If a foreign agent, which could be\nfood or a planetary in\u0003uence, disturbed the union of the tria prima, as\nPagel stated:\nsulphur could be released from its union with the other principles . . . and\ndevour the mercury. If [mercury] becomes too strong it will coagulate salt\nand sulphur or else dissolve the salt. All such disorder and imbalance spells\ninterference by an outside force . . . By contrast, ancient humoralism had\nconcentrated on inside components such as this or that humour acquiring\ndestructive qualities and thus causing disease. Instead it is abnormal ignition of sulphur that consumes the radical moisture in man; it dissipates\nthe mercury which was to be separated in the stomach for nutrition of\nthe whole of the body with the result of emaciation . . . and hectic fever.\nThe agent disturbing the union of the principles introduced with the\nfood; it is of \u2018excremental\u2019 nature and thus indigestible. Moreover\u2014unlike\nnormal excrement\u2014it does not leave the body again, but forms local\n[salt] deposits\u2014tartar\u2014that obstruct the preformed anatomical channels\ncausing diseases by obstruction.67\nThe most common disease which manifested these obstructions of salty\ntartar was gout.

For every voiding of Ordure is caused by the Salt, both in sound\nmen, and sick; One is the Salt of Nature, (viz. the sound mans). The other\nis a corrupted and resolved Salt [Tartar]: From hence tis to be gathered,\nthat even by Salts the Cure of it is to be perfected, in such wise, that the\nSalt may again recti\u0002ed and separate the resolved Salt from the Sound.69\nIn his discussion of purges for tartarous disease, Tymme concentrated\nparticularly upon antimony, and in Chapter XVI of the Practice, described a triad of medicines\u2014mercurial, antimonial, and arsenicals\nthat would respectively cure mercurious, saline, and sulphureous diseases.70 Thought to be \u201csweet as Cassia,\u201d antimony was considered \u201ca\nseparated Salt.\u201d Paracelsus commented\nOf all minerals antimony contains the highest and strongest Arcanum\n[remedy]. It puri\u0002es itself and at the same time everything else that is\nimpure. Furthermore, if there is nothing healthy at all inside the body, it\ntransforms the impure body into a pure one which was proved in cases\nof leprosy.71\nIn doing so, Tymme was using inorganic materials like \u201cmercurials,\nantimonials, and the mineral acids in internal medicines\u201d in the nascent\nperiod of medical chemistry prior to 1600.72 As McCallum has demon-\n68\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

In a series of decrees and court cases this powerful body tried to forbid any use of chemistry in medicine. Nevertheless,\npublishers continued to print books favoring medical chemistry, and by\nthe early years of the new century courses in the preparation of pharmaceutical chemicals were available in Paris.75\nEven before such controversies, Paracelsus himself recognized that its\ntoxic nature meant that antimony had to be alchemically puri\u0002ed. As\nArndt has described, Paracelsus believed that antimony had to be \u201cfree\nof its toxicity\u201d before medical usage, and as Paracelsus wrote, \u201cIn the\nsame way and form that antimony \u0002nishes in gold (in the sense of\ncleansing), it will perfect the body as well. It namely contains the\nEssentia, which does not allow anything impure to come together with\nthe pure.\u201d Historian of chemistry David Schein has indicated in a course\nof modern experiments that when antimony is added to a combination of melted metals, it \u201cwill associate with those containing gold and\npart from the \u2018impure\u2019 metals. Because antimony seemingly \u2018eats\u2019 and\n\u2018extracts\u2019 the precious metals, it was also called \u2018wolf of metals\u2019 or \u2018the\nmagnet of the wise.\u2019 \u201d76\nThis ability of antimony was thus thought by Tymme to have a\nsimilar effect in man as well, purging toxins and obstructions such as\n73\nIan McCallum, Antimony in Medical History: An Account of the Medical Uses of Antimony\nand Its Compounds since Early Times to the Present (Bishop Auckland, England: Pentland\nPress, 1999).\n74\nKate Frost, \u201cPrescription and Devotion: The reverend Doctor Donne the Learned\nDoctor Mayerne\u2014Two Seventeenth-Century Records of Epidemic Typhoid Fever,\u201d\nMedical History, 22 (1978), pp. 408\u2013419, on p. 413; Ulrich Arndt, \u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s\nMagnet: Alchemical Transmutation of Antimony,\u201d Paracelsus, (November 2005), pp.\n12\u201317.\n75\nAllen Debus, Paracelsus: Five Hundred Years, Three American Exhibits at the National\nLibrary of Medicine, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_\n2.html.

And, Tymme in the Practice indeed associated\nantimony with a magnetic loadstone, not only because of its ability like\na magnet to attract other metals, but because like salt and like iron,\nantimony \u201cwas more corpulent like other things.\u201d In other words, just\nlike salt, antimony gave bodily substance to matter, and like nitrous salt,\nit had ability to dissolve metals, and was called by Paracelsus, \u201cthe true\nbath of gold.\u201d Like other saline substances, antimony could also be\nmelted into a glass-like substance, and was thought to contain all bodily\ncharacteristics of matter within itself. At the University of Munich,\nSchein performed a series of modern experiments according to a\nformula of the alchemist Basilius Valentinus in the Triumph-Waggon of\nAntimony (1604). Schein slowly and gently heated antimony-ore, which\nconsists of a mixture of different antimony-oxides and especially of\nsulphides, until there were no more toxic fumes, and everything was\nmelted to glass.77 Because the glass can adopt any color of the spectrum,\njust as nitre heated in an alembic displayed all colors, this was proof\nto Valentinus and Paracelsian chemists like Duchesne that antimony\nwas like a salt that contained all qualities within it.78\nDuchesne\u2019s contemporary, Turquet de Mayerne, also theorized about\nthe uses of saline medicaments. Educated at Heidelberg, Montpellier,\nand Paris, he became one of the physicians-in-ordinary to Henry IV,\nmuch like Duchesne. In 1603, Mayerne became involved in the antimony wars and with Duchesne was condemned in the Apologia Medicine\nper Hippocratis et Galeni, contra Mayernium et Quercetanum. In 1607, Mayerne\ncame to England and formed intellectual connections with the English\ncourt, and after the assassination of Henry IV, became a court physician to James I.79\nIn his treatise of gout translated from the French by English court\nphysician Thomas Sherley (1638\u20131678), Mayerne explicated his doc-\n77\nArndt, \u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s Magnet,\u201d p. 14.\nFor a description of Paracelsus\u2019 preparation of antimonial medicine, see chapter\n14 in Paracelsus his Aurora, &amp; Treasure of the Philosophers.

As a Paracelsian, Mayerne\ndisregards any primary causative role of the Galenic humors in gout,\nproclaiming that it arose when salt \u201cexceeds and abounds\u201d the ability\nof the body to absorb it. In normal digestion, the aliment is \u201cdissolv\u2019d\ninto the Chyle,\u201d which is separated into the salt, sulphur and mercury.\nSalts are communicated to the blood, forming a Balsam for the body,\nand excess salts were excreted \u0002rst in the urine, and then \u201csent off by\nSweat,\u201d where they degenerate into thick \u201cscurse and foulness, sticking to the skin.\u201d81 When the body was unable to process excess salts in\nbodily liquids, salt would \u201cin\u0003ame the parts, and vacillates and gnaws\nthem,\u201d causing the pain of arthritis.82 Hence the \u201cErratick Gout\u201d which\n\u201cshifteth placed, sparing no joint, but invading all of them successively,\u201d\nand which had as its root cause a salty \u0003ood of humors, was best cured\nby \u201chydragogol,\u201d or water-purging humors like syrup of the salt of\nhartshorn (ammonium carbonate).83 If there were such a quantity of salt\nthat could not be absorbed by bodily liquors, then of necessity \u201cit will\nbe stopt in its passages and Vessells . . . and be coagulated into different\nsort of Stones, according to the nature of predominant Salts.\u201d\nHere the crystalline shapes of gouty tartarous concretions could be\nanalyzed to see if what types of salts were responsible, and Mayerne\nnoted the similarity of the growth of nodules in the body to salts made\nby chymical processes, as well as to minerals in the earth,\nNay, he that shall remove his contemplations from the Coagulations of\nSalts, to those which happen to Stones and Marcasit[e]s, he shall \u0002nd\nseveral of them so elaborately form\u2019d according to Geometrical Rules,\nthat he will be forced to acknowledge that Art is out-done by Nature.84\n(We shall see in the next chapter that microscopic analyses of salt\ncrystals for the purposes of classi\u0002cation became a common practice\nin the late seventeenth century.)\n80\nTheodor Turquet De Mayerne, A Treatise of the Gout.

If the salts responsible for gouty pains were\nvolatile, they would be diffused throughout the body, and best treated\nby internal medicines which would also diffuse readily, like salt of\ntartar dissolved in water; so although here Mayerne is following the\n\u201clike cures like\u201d Paracelsian principle, he is also taking into account\nthe chymical composition of the salt responsible.85 Purges like the salt\nof tartar, or spirit of salt (hydrochloric acid) would also rid the body\nof the tartarous deposits and \u201cslime stuck to the sides of the stomach,\u201d\nrelieving the disease\u2019s symptoms, and it \u201ccould lead salt matter away\nthrough the urine.\u201d86\nMayerne also thought that nitre in particular could also be a good\npurge, but only if taken in the wane of the moon, which showed a\ncurious mix of Galenic and Paracelsian principles in his treatments.\nParacelsian medicine, again in a \u201clike cures like\u201d manner, predicted the\nnitrous salt would dissolve kidney and bladder stones. The stricture to\ntake the medicine at the wane of the moon was an old Hippocratic and\nGalenic belief in astronodia, the belief attributed to Hippocrates that\nthe presence of the moon in different signs of the zodiac in\u0003uenced the\nhumoral content of various parts of the body.87 The moon was thought\nto be \u201ccold and moist, of the nature of Water,\u201d and hence \u201cprognosticateth such as proceed of watry humours, citrine water, and salt\n\u0003egm, for the most part with swellings and breakings out . . . retention\nof menstrua, and all other excrements, as . . . urine and Sweat, and the\ninordinate evacuation of them\u201d as well as lymphatic diseases such as\nscrofula.88 Because the moon had to do with the retention and evacuation of bodily \u0003uids, its position in the zodiac dictated the best time\nfor administering the humoral therapy of phlebotomy, which purged\n85\nNance also notes that Mayerne did not slavishly adhere to \u201clike cures like,\u201d but\nlimits his analysis to de Mayerne\u2019s use of chymical contraries, such as a sweet salt balancing a sour one.

In the wane of the moon, the bodily \u0003uids were\nat lower levels, and a purge such as nitre would therefore be less dilute\nin the body, effecting more purgation.\nMayerne also rather typically implicated the stomach in most gouty\ndiseases, postulating that the stomach failed to separate excremental\nmatter which was intrinsic to food. Thus, he also prescribed the usual\ndietary cautions of avoiding salted meats and strong wines with their\nexcess tartar; wine could be watered down, or sugar of lead (lead acetate)\ncould be added to wines that abounded with a \u201cvitrioline tartar, sharp\nand pricking,\u201d resulting in its precipitating out (likely the precipitate\nwas acetic acid).90\nHe also told patients to avoid venery, which \u201cstirred up salt humors\u201d\nand made the patient weak, again emphasizing the connection between\nsalt and generative principles.91 A sweet salt such as sugar of lead, which\nhe believed mitigated and sweetened the humors, could also abate\nvenereal desires by tempering the humors\u2019 saltiness.92\nGlauber, the nitrous alkahest, and the vitrioline sal mirabile\nIn the \u0002rst half of the seventeenth century, Paracelsian physicians and\nchemists thus utilized different combinations of Aristotelian elements\nand Paracelsian principles to suit their practical and philosophical\nbeliefs about saline chemistry. We have thus seen so far that salt was\nthought to be a primary component of physical matter, its chymical\ncomposition affected secondary qualities of matter such as taste and\ncolor. Its balance in the body was important; if too prevalent, salt would\ncoalesce into tarterous obstructions that could cause gout, arthritis, and\nkidney and bladder stones. In a philosophical and spiritual sense, salt\nwas thought to be inherently generative, reproductive, and connected\n89\nSee Charles W.

His project, De Nitro Theses quaedam, a brief tract containing\na synopsis of current chemical theory about saltpetre, and miscellaneous experimental evidence was based on Paracelsian chemistry.96\nThe Kincardine Papers of Sir Robert Moray, an early Royal Society\n\u0002gure, also illustrated that he consulted Glauber\u2019s medical works extensively.97 Glauber\u2019s work was also translated and published in England\nthroughout the seventeenth century; it thus seems Glauber\u2019s ideas on\nsalts are important to consider in our analysis of the context of English\nsalt chymistry.\nGlauber, born in Karlstadt, Bavaria, was one of the \u0002rst industrial chymists and best known for the stomach remedy\u2014Glauber\u2019s\nsalt\u2014sodium sulphate. He was self-taught, and in the upheaval of the\nThirty Year\u2019s War, traveled to Vienna when he was 21 years old.98 As\nColin Russell related, Glauber became ill with a stomach bug known as\n\u2018the Hungarian disease.\u2019 As he was unable to keep down solid food, he\nwas \u201crecommended to try drinking water from a spring near Neustadt.\nImprovising a cup by hollowing out part of a loaf he imbibed some of\nthe \u0003uid and was cured with astonishing rapidity.\u201d99 Curious to know\nthe cause of his recovery, he evaporated the water and obtained long\nthin crystals that seemed similar to nitre. Glauber however subsequently\nshowed that the salt in question was not nitre. Glauber wrote, \u201cfor it\ncould not be the water of Saltpetre seeing that in no wise conduceth\nto the stomach, but rather occasioneth nauseousness and loathing.\u201d100\nRather, Glauber concluded it \u201cthe same compound as that obtained\nwhen vitriol (sulphuric acid) acted on common salt\u201d or sodium sulphate.101 Since sodium sulphate has laxative qualities, it well could\nhave effected his cure. The sodium sulphate was termed by Glauber\nas sal mirabile or miraculous salt.

As Porto has demonstrated, the\nalkahest began as an \u201cobscure invention of Paracelsus,\u201d and became\nwidely known in the early modern era as one of physician Johann van\nHelmont\u2019s most important secrets.103 Glauber thought the alkahest was\nnitre or potassium nitrate because its products could be both very acidic\nand very basic, both of which were corrosive.104 For instance, nitre could\nbe distilled with fuller\u2019s earth or vitriol to make nitric acid (spirit of\nnitre or volatile nitre), a strong acid or, it could be \u201c\u0002xed\u201d by burning\nit with charcoal, producing potassium carbonate, a very powerful base.\nBecause products from nitre could be very acidic, or very basic, Glauber\n\u0002rst published in 1633 that it was a universal solvent. Porto claims correctly that Glauber believed the alkahest stemmed from but a family\nof substances that included \u201cnitre itself, nitric acid (produced by the\ndistillation of saltpeter), and potassium carbonate (produced by adding\ncharcoal to fused nitre).\u201d105 In Glauber\u2019s Apology against Farner, published\nin 1652, which was largely a diatribe against his former research partner whom he accused of stealing his chymical secrets, he gives fairly\ndetailed instructions for preparing his nitrous alkahest. Glauber \u0002rst\nargues that\nwhat moved Helmont to call it Alkahest, we shall not here dispute: In\nindeed believe he did it, thereby to demonstrate its Nature and Essence;\nin the Brabantick Idiom, which was the Mother Tongue of the Authors\nit sounds Althohees, that is very hot; and so the name answers to the\n102\nAhonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in SeventeenthCentury Chemistry,\u201d p. 95.\n103\nPaolo A.

Boerhaave was also of the opinion\nthat Glauber\u2019s alkahest consisted of potassium carbonate. See Herman Boerhaave,\nElementa chemiae (Leyden, 1732), vol. I, pp. 848\u2013868.\n\nPages 54:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n37\nEssence, for this Liquor is nothing but a meer \u0002ery Water, by whose\nimmense and secret heat Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, if they are\nput in to \u0002re a certain time, are forthwith purged, preened and made\nbetter. This Menstruum then, is nothing but igneous Liquor, prepared\nof urinous Salts.106\nThis alkahest was from related nitrous salts for\nNature is copious, and sets before our eyes many various Ingredients,\nfrom which, by the help of Arts, divers things may be effected . . . for the\ngenuine Sal terra, or Salt-Petre, may be made of Salt of Tartar; and of\nSal terra, or Nitre, a \u0002xed Salt, like Salt of Tartar; of spirit of Wine, Salt\nof Tartar, and of Salt of Tartar spirit of Wine; of Wine-Vinegar, Nitre,\nand of Nitre, corrosive Vinegar. So those Salts partake of either nature\nand will be managed at pleasure.107\nJust as Tymme in the Practice utilized the heating of wine and its vinegar to show that a triad of \u0002xed, sulphureous, and mercurious salts\nall stemmed from one material salt which was responsible for bodily\nsubstance, colors and tastes, Glauber argued that calcining wine produced a variety of interchangeable saline products that were all alkahests\ncapable of re\u0002ning matter. For instance, salt of tartar, often found as a\ncrustlike deposit on wine casks, was a traditional raw material for the\npreparation of potassium carbonate after calcination.108\nIt was no accident that Glauber\u2019s alkahest came from products of\nwine. Some of this state of affairs may have been due to the in\u0003uence of\nVan Helmont. In Van Helmont\u2019s Arcana Paracelsi, he claimed \u201cEminentior\nest ejus liquor Alkahest immortalis, immutabilis aqua solvens, et sal circulatus ejus,\nqui reducit omne corpus tangibile, in liquorem sui concreti.\u201d109 In other words,\nthere was a liquor alkahest and its sal circulatus; the sal circulatus as\nDarnstaedter illustrated was an alcoholic solution.110\nThe spirit of wine (ethanol) was also the prime solvent for preparing\nGlauber\u2019s aurum potabile, a drinkable tincture of gold.

Anthony\u2019s aurum potabile was a potent emetic and cathartic\nthat was as likely to cure his patients as kill them.111 Anthony, like Glauber, wished to \u0002nd a means to dissolve an insoluble substance like gold\nand make its healing properties digestable.112 Hence Glauber used his\nalkahest to achieve that aim. Glauber believed that this \u201ctincture, which\nthey have radically joyned with the spirit of Wine,\u201d was a \u201cheating and\nliving spirit, communicating its strength and faculties to man\u2019s body.\u201d113\nThe aurum potabile contained the vivifying power of the sun; taking the\nspirit of wine chymically combined with gold would cure the body by\nengendering in a chymically concentrated increase of the \u201chumidum\nradicale\u201d or vital spirits that one would attain in lesser concentrations\nby basking in the sun.114 The potency of the aurum potabile also demonstrated the \u201cgreatest harmony of all things, betwixt the Sun, Gold,\nman and wine.\u201d115 Behind this harmony were the nitrous salts of the\nalkahest\u2014the aerial nitre Glauber postulated was in sunbeams made\nvines grow to produce wine, engendered the growth of minerals like\ngold in the bowels of the earth, and nitre was also in human urine,\nfurthering the macrocosm, microcosm analogy. As Glauber stated,\nthere is nothing can be brought forth in the nature of things, without the\nmedium of salt; yea man himself is not born without the Sun, Man, and\nSalt. . . . The sun and salt are the Parents of all things, which procreate\nall things and without nothing is procreated. . . . Salt being added to Wine\nin its fermentation, rendereth it stronger and sweeter.116\nBecause the alkahest of nitre broke down matter to its most basic level,\nand because salts were thought responsible for color, Glauber produced\na comprehensive list of how nitre could be used to create artist\u2019s paints\nand differently hued glazes.

It is also possible that wine, important in\nEucharistic ceremonies as it was believed by Catholics to be capable of transmutation,\ncarried mystical signi\u0002cance for Glauber. Ahonen has discussed the Christological\nsymbolism of Glauber\u2019s chymistry extensively in her dissertation.

Glauber also knew that nitric acid would stain nails,\nfeathers, or quills gold, and it could be utilized as a purple glaze in\npottery. The acid\u2019s af\u0002nity with precious metals also meant that when\nit was mixed and heated with gold, silver, or copper along with some\nantimony, a \u201cvitri\u0002ed\u201d pottery glaze could be made that would \u201cfar\nexceed in beauty or splendour those vessels which are gilt with those\nMetals.\u201d118\nSome contemporaries of Glauber, such as Sir Robert Moray, a\nfounder of the Royal Society, had great regard for Glauber\u2019s alkahest,\nas well as his other medicaments, such as Glauber\u2019s panacea antimonialis.\nThis was probably antimony pentasulphide as described in Glauber\u2019s\nMiraculum Mundi, though Moray stated that \u201cI guess by the color (red)\nit is rather some preparation of vitriol.\u201d119 In a letter to his friend and\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alexander Bruce, Moray wrote, \u201cPut your doctor to a further\nenquiry about that powder of Glauberus, I beseech you, for if he hold\nall he heights there is not two remedies in the world preferable to it.\u201d120\nHe warned Bruce however to get the powder of Glauber\u2019s \u201cown making,\u201d as if it was not, the medicinal results would likely \u201cblast\u201d Glauber\u2019s\n\u201creputation when everybody that meddles in his trade thinks him one\nof the noblest chimists now living.\u201d121\nMoray put his \u0002nger on a problem that Glauber had among his fellow natural philosophers. Glauber\u2019s work was not always considered\nclearly expressed by his contemporaries. Not only was Glauber fairly\nvague about the exact nature of his alkahest in an attempt to shield its\nidentity from all but alchemical adepti, but his use of chymical terms\ncould be inconsistent. The Leiden physician Herman Boerhaave, who\nwas thorough enough in his devotion to chymistry to read the works\nof Van Helmont seven times over, was quite convinced that Glauber\u2019s\nalkahest consisted only of potassium carbonate; members of the Hartlib\n117\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 179.\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 181.\n119\n7/17 November 1657.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized the content from pages 36 to 57 of the document, focusing on the evolution of Paracelsian theories of salts in relation to alchemical and medical practices, particularly through the figures of Duchesne, Tymme, Paracelsus, and Glauber. Below are key points:

1. <strong>Paracelsian Concepts of Salts</strong>:
   - Joseph Duchesne (1544–1609) promoted the Paracelsian idea of the tria prima (sulphur, mercury, and salt) as fundamental to understanding matter. His *Practice of Chymicall Physicke* (1610) discussed how salts retained their essence even after calcination, using examples like palingenesis and metallic salts formed through heat and water exposure [*Practice of Chymicall Physicke*, 1610, p. 36](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=36).

2. <strong>Fire Analysis and Salts</strong>:
   - In line with Paracelsus&#x27; theories, fire analysis was thought to reveal the true constituents of matter. However, opponents like Erastus believed fire altered the original bodies rather than revealing the basic components [*Fire Analysis*, p. 39](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=39).
   
3. <strong>Spiritual and Physical Salts</strong>:
   - Salts had a dual nature in Paracelsian thought: a physical, imperfect salt and a spiritual, generative salt responsible for reproduction and creation in nature. This concept extended to agricultural and medical uses, reflecting the alchemists&#x27; focus on both material and exalted principles [p. 42](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=42).

4. <strong>Notable Equipment and Experiments</strong>:
   - Salts were extracted from plants, metals, and other sources using calcination and distillation, with experiments showing their transformative properties, such as the reproduction of plant-like shapes from ashes [p. 37](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=37).

5. <strong>Glauber&#x27;s Alkahest (Universal Solvent)</strong>:
   - Johann Glauber (1604–1670) viewed nitre as the key ingredient in the alkahest, a powerful solvent. His works influenced the Hartlib Circle, an important group of natural philosophers [*Glauber, 1650, p. 55*](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=55).

These sections delve into the theories connecting salts with both material and spiritual realms in alchemy, focusing on figures like Tymme and Glauber, who expanded the practical and philosophical roles of salts in chymistry and medicine.

Young has also\ncommented on how Glauber\u2019s reputation declined severely in England\nat the time of the Restoration.127\nGlauber\u2019s failure with nitre led him to turn his attention to his sal\nmirabile, which was of a fundamentally different nature than his alkahest. His philosophical salt was not a mere dissolvent, but was behind\nthe creation of matter, such as minerals and metals. As revealed in his\nTreatise of the Nature of Salts, Glauber\u2019s philosophical salt was sodium\nsulphate, (Na2SO4\u202210H2O; this decahydrate became known as Glauber\u2019s\nsalt), a combination of common salt and spirit of vitriol (sulphuric acid).\nIn this reaction, hydrochloric acid is also produced from sodium chloride\nand sulphuric acid in which case the Na2SO4 is known as salt cake:\n2 NaCl + H2SO4 o Na2SO4 + 2 HCl\nSodium sulphate may have been Glauber\u2019s choice for his sal mirabile\nbecause one of its reactants\u2014vitriol\u2014had the advantage of being\n\u201cconveniently assimilable\u201d to some of the principles of to the Paracelsian tria prima of salt, sulphur, mercury.128 Vitriol was a salt in the form\nof iron II sulphate produced when pyrites were exposed to moist air,\nand the vitriolic liquid or sulphureous spirit of vitriol (sulphuric acid)\ncalled \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur\u2019 was believed by Glauber and other early modern\nmining authors such as Agricola to be a sign of the presence of metals as well as the petrifaction of wood.129 Glauber in his Philosophical\nFurnaces wrote extensively of the production of sulphuric acid from the\nmixture of pyrites\u2014iron or copper sulphates, with water, and called\nvitriol a \u201cmetallical seed.\u201d130 He also commented that \u201cno sulphur is\ndestitute of vitriol, nor vitriol of sulphur . . . and every sulphur is by its\n126\nThe Hartlib Papers, Hartlib to John Winthrop the younger, 16 March 1660,\nRef: 7/7/3B.\n127\nJ.T.

See Glauber, A Third Paradox, p. 695.\n\nPages 60:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n43\nmature, it would become gold.137 The sal mirabile was thus most prevalent\nin immature metals, and not present in the fully mature gold.138 But the\ngeneration of hard metals from the delicate sal mirabile was a ticklish\nbusiness. If not brought to maturity, and exposed to air too soon by\nimpatient miners, \u201ctheir life consisting in a Volatile Salt, is elevated and\ndrawn back by the stars.\u201d139 If exposed too soon to water, Glauber also\nclaimed the tender salts of the embryonic metals would dissolve. And,\nwhen metals were removed prematurely from the earth,\nfrom which they have no more nutriment, their sulphureous covering being\nlaid aside, the defense and safeguard of their Nature being banished, they\nrightly resemble a decrepit Old Man, whose Radical moisture is dried\nup and are dissolved and eaten up by the same Astral Salt, or Vehement\nCorruscation, from which they did spring.140\nWhen exposed to air, metallic sul\u0002des, like copper and iron pyrites (fools\u2019\ngold or iron sul\u0002des\u2014(FeS2), obtain a green sulphureous or vitriolic\ntarnish (iron II sulphate), which may have led to Glauber\u2019s idea that\nthe \u201csulphureous coat\u201d was protecting growing metals.\nGlauber then discussed the medicinal virtues of his sal mirabile.\nHe claimed that when sal mirabile was heated with gold producing a\ngreen salt and a phlegm, and the green salt was extracted with Spirit\nof Wine (ethanol), he obtained his \u201cgreen lyon,\u201d or his \u201cvitriol of Sol\n[gold].\u201d141 As a product of the philosophical \u201csalt, gold, and wine,\u201d the\nmedicine\u2019s green liquor renewed the body, as the \u201cgreenness of the\nTrees half dead . . . in the Spring time,\u201d caused the \u201cblood in the body\nto be renewed and revived.\u201d142 It is not entirely clear what the chymical\ncomposition was of this \u201cvitriol of Sol.\u201d Glauber also vehemently denied\n137\nSee Ahonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in SeventeenthCentury Chemistry,\u201d p. 135, as well as Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature: Women,\nEcology and the Scienti\u0002c Revolution (San Francisco: Harper San Francisco, 1990), pp. 25\u201341\nfor a discussion of the maturation of metals. In other places Glauber claimed that an\nacid spirit within the sulphureous sal mirabile protected the \u201ctender salt\u201d of the embryonic\nmetal from destruction, allowing it to mature to its \u0002nal form. He wrote, \u201cThat mineral\nacid which is plentifully found in vitriol and sulphur is the only Agent whereby Nature\nMaturates the yet volatile and unripe Minerals in the earth,\u201d and in another tract that\nthe ripening agent in the earth was the sulphureous salt of vitriol.\n138\nAhonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in Seventeenth-Century\nChemistry,\u201d p. 105.\n139\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 124.\n140\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 124.\n141\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 265.\n142\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 266.\n\nPages 61:\n44\nchapter two\nits green color was the result of any copper compounds; he also claimed\nhe was not merely dissolving gold in aqua regia (nitric and hydrochloric\nacid) to get his green lyon, claiming such a mixture would be gold in\ncolor (it is actually yellowish-green and a method still utilized by jewelers\nto purify gold).143 It is possible that Glauber may have utilized a mixture\nof real and fool\u2019s gold, as the salt of green vitriol, produced by the\nexposure of pyrites to moist air, dissolved in ethanol would make a\ngreen solution. His description of the oil of vitriol produced from\npyrites in his Philosophical Furnaces is also remarkably similar to that of\nthe vitriol of sol; both solutions resulted from dissolving green salts\nin water or alcohol, were bright green in color, and produced similar\nmedical cures.144 Further he indicates in the Philosophical Furnaces that\nboth the \u201cgold Marcasites\u201d of pyrites as well as \u201cgold ore\u201d can produce\nthe oil of vitriol, which he calls as a medicine the \u201cgold of physicians,\u201d\nsuggesting he saw marcasites and gold as functionally equivalent in the\nproduction of medicines.145\nGlauber\u2019s vitriol of sol also defended humanity from putrefaction\nand corruption, as it was made from the \u201cmost noble part of Salt,\u201d\nand the purest metal of Gold; though Glauber does not speci\u0002cally\nclaim it was the philosopher\u2019s stone, he may have had in his mind this\nassociation. Some chymists postulated vitriol itself was the philosopher\u2019s\nstone; common until the eighteenth century was the \u201cvitriol acrostic\u201d:\nVisita Interiora Terrae Recti\u0002cando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (visit the interior\nof the earth; by rectifying you will \u0002nd the hidden stone.)146 Glauber\nhimself mentions this acrostic in his Philosophical Furnaces and stated\nthe ancients by this verse \u201cwould give us to understand that a true\nmedicine is to be found in it.\u201d147\nGlauber also emphasized water as an important medium of transport\nfor the sal mirabile. He asked,\n143\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 267.\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, pp. 70\u201373. In the Furnaces, he\ndescribes this oil of vitriol as a \u201csweet oil\u201d of vitriol, usually known as ether, made\nfrom distilling ethanol and sulphuric acid. However, the process in which he describes\nmaking his oil of vitriol does not involve ethanol, but the exposure of pyrites to moist\nair, and the collection of the green crystals. The green salts were mixed with water,\nand evaporated several times until a \u201csweet oil or juyce\u201d resulted.\n145\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, p. 70.\n146\nSee Emerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 210, footnote 2.\n147\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, p. 73.\n144\n\nPages 62:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n45\nwherefore did the ancient Philosopher and Poets worship Venus, the Goddess of . . .

Though Glauber does not mention\nVan Helmont as a factor in these conclusions, it is possible Glauber\u2019s\nspeculations may have been partially fueled by Helmont\u2019s belief that\nwater consisted of corpuscles made up of the tria prima and thus was\nthe source of transformations of matter.149 Van Helmont himself identi\u0002ed his universal salt, termed the \u201chungry hermaphroditical salt\u201d as a\nsulphureous acidic salt present in fountains, and described how when\nit was reacted with metals like brass, it created vitriol.150 As Pagel has\nnoted, Van Helmont believed that\nsalty sea water percolating into the earth, loses its salt . . . the water then\nassumes at appropriate places the semina of indigenous salt, mineral\nor metal. Thus, out of water grow saltpeter, alum, vitriol and sea-salt.\nThese form a primitive mineral juice, the bur, which is the germ-cell of\nindividual metals and minerals. The latter grow to maturity when there\nis not further in\u0003ux of water.151\nWhether it was due to his belief that metals grew in mines fed by water,\nor to Van Helmont\u2019s ideas, sal mirabile\u2019s watry medium of transport\nrather than air (as nitre was transmitted) may have made it an attractive\nchoice for Glauber when deciding upon the identity of his philosophical salt.\n148\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 266.\nWilliam R.

While\nhe acknowledges the important of nitre as expressed in earlier authors\nlike Duchesne and Paracelsus, he postulates its power was expressed for\nnew purposes\u2014namely the Helmontian alkahest. Whereas Duchesne\nacknowledges the role of salts in color and taste, it is via its ability\nas an alkahest that nitre is able to manifest these physical changes in\nGlauber\u2019s works. Glauber\u2019s use of a sulphuric compound as his universal\nsalt brings together in\u0003uences from mining authors like Agricola and\nthe \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur,\u2019 as well as the new emphasis on water in the work of\nVan Helmont, who as we will see in the next chapter, also had great\nin\u0003uence in forming conceptions of salts among English chymists in\nthe early Royal Society.\n\nPages 64:\nCHAPTER THREE\nVAN HELMONT, SALTS, AND NATURAL HISTORY IN\nEARLY MODERN ENGLAND\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the in\u0002uence of Paracelsian ideas\nin salt chymistry in English works was profound in the \u0003rst half of the\nseventeenth century, as the tria prima of Paracelsus gave salt a central\nrole in matter theory. However, we have also demonstrated that Johann\nGlauber, whose work was known to members of the Hartlib circle,\nwas in\u0002uenced by the work of Van Helmont, most speci\u0003cally in his\nconcept of the alkahest and in water as a method of transport for his\nsal mirabile. Certainly, the realization that Van Helmont was crucial to\nthe development of early modern chymistry in the latter half of the\nseventeenth century, particularly in the work of Robert Boyle, has been\ncogently demonstrated by Principe and Newman.1 In the case of saline\nchymistry in the early Royal Society however, it would be a mistake to\nlimit ourselves to a story of Van Helmont as interpreted by Boyle; nor\nwere all of Van Helmont\u2019s ideas utilized for purely chymical or iatrochymical studies. Royal Society \u0003gures such as Martin Lister, Robert\nMoray, and Nehemiah Grew interpreted Van Helmont\u2019s chymical work\nquite independently of Boyle for the purposes of their own work in\nnatural history, a topic to which this chapter will be devoted after a brief\ncontextual analysis of the role of salts in Helmontian chymistry.\nVan Helmont\u2019s theories of the elements and of salt differed greatly\nfrom those of Paracelsus. First, Van Helmont believed that water and\nair were the only true elements. In his Paradoxes, Van Helmont explained\nhis theory of the interrelationship of elements and principles. \u201cthere\nare Originally two onely Elements in the Universe, to wit, the Air, and\nthe Water; which are suf\u0003ciently insinuated from the sacred Text, by the\nSpirit swimming upon the Abysse or greet Deep or Waters, in the \u0003rst\n1\nWilliam R.

Like Erastus, he\nbelieved that heat created new compounds rather than revealing the\nbuilding blocks of a substance; \u201csalt, sulphur and mercury were thus\nnot true principles, but were produced by the heat of analysis.\u201d5\nFor Van Helmont, salts in particular were \u201coffspring of the waters,\u201d\nand if exposed to the Sun, \u201care made aiery and vapoury Ef\u0002uxes,\nrushing into water with a hastened Violence.\u201d6 In other words, some\nsalts could be powerfully volatile. Volatile salts referred to salts that\ngave off an aeriform component (such as an odor), but also to salts that\ndecomposed easily on heating. Boyle\u2019s de\u0003nition of volatile was even\nmore speci\u0003c; he believed the corpuscular bits of volatile matter had to\nbe \u201cvery small\u201d so they are more \u201ceasily put into motion by the action of\nthe Fire and other agents.\u201d7 The speci\u0003c volatile salts that van Helmont,\nand subsequently Boyle had in mind were most likely ammonium\ncarbonate, and ammonium chloride known as sal ammoniac or a\nvolatile alkali.8 Fixed salts referred to salts with a degree of solidity of\na substance as measured by the ability of that substance to resist the\naction of \u0003re, those which were nonvolatile; an example is potassium\ncarbonate which is noncombustible. Not surprisingly, Boyle classi\u0003ed\n\u0003xed substances as being composed of large or \u201cgross\u201d particles which\nwould be \u201ctoo unwieldy and unapt to be carried up into the Air by\n2\nJ.B.

In his\nanalysis of the chymistry of the blood, he claimed that venous blood,\nhaving given nourishment to the organs of the body, was made volatile\nand converted into gas which was breathed out.10 This conversion of\nthe venous blood into breath was thus done chemically, and concerned\nwith the production of \u0003xed and volatile salts. The historian Walter\nPagel further explains van Helmont\u2019s theories of blood chymistry:\nFixed salt is alkali; its particles are stable and form a deposit when a\nsubstance containing it is lique\u0003ed by heat. In settling down, it \u201csnatches\u201d\nparticles of less subtle nature\u2014so called sulphurous particles\u2014which are\nincorporated in the deposit. The \u0003xed salt being unable to \u0003x all the sulphur particles, the rest, which have escaped being snatched, follow their\nnatural tendency to become volatile and in their turn force some of the\nsalt to evaporate with them. Thus, volatile salt is generated. When heated\nin an open vessel all salt contained in the substance evaporates. This is\nwhat happens to the . . . [venous] blood in the . . . lung, that is where it\nis in contact with the air. All its salt has become volatile whereby it is\ndisposable by the breath.11\nClericuzio has in turn shown that \u201cEnglish Helmontians based their\nphysiological theories on the notion of vital spirits, which they conceived as a volatile alkaline salt.\u201d12 Physicians such as Francis Glisson\n(1597\u20131677), Walter Charleton (1619\u20131707), and Thomas Willis (1621\u2013\n1675) all believed this spirit was particulate, having \u201cspeci\u0003c chemical\nproperties;\u201d Willis for instance saw a \u201cvolatile salt, produced by the\naction of a local ferment situated in the brain, as the actual matter of\nanimal spirits.\u201d13 Frank has also demonstrated that William Harvey and\n9\nRobert Boyle, Experimental Notes of the Mechanical Origins or Production of Fixtness\n(Oxford: E.

Most of Coxe\u2019s experiments had to do with palingenics, or the \u201cresurrection of plants, and the chemical method of achieving their\nastral appearance after destruction.\u201d Coxe took a plant, bruised it, burnt it, collected\nits ashes, and, in the process of calcination, extracted from it a volatile salt. He then\nmade a compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat, and there gradually arose from the ashes, salt crystals which resembled a stem, leaves and \u0002owers; or,\nin other words, an apparition of the plant which had been submitted to combustion.\nInformation on palingenics for this note was taken from Lewis Spence, Encyclopedia of\nOccultism (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1968), s.v. \u201cpalingenics.\u201d\n17\nCoxe, \u201cA Continuation of Dr. Daniel Coxe\u2019s Discourse,\u201d p. 172.\n\nPages 68:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n51\nMany of these remarkable effects that salt produced in the atmosphere\nwere relevant to \u0003elds of natural history, as well as meteorology, both\npredominant \u0003elds of study for the early Royal Society. Natural history was a disciplinal mainstay of the Baconian program of deductive\nempiricism from which the Royal Society claimed was its methodological basis. Michael Hunter, as well as scholars studying early museums,\nincluding the Royal Society\u2019s own collections and the Ashmolean,\nhas illustrated the importance of natural history to the early modern\nscienti\u0003c program.18 Figures such Nehemiah Grew contributed work\nin botany, and Martin Lister wrote about spa waters and conchology.\nRobert Boyle and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Daniel Coxe, described as \u201chaving the\nrole of Boyle\u2019s alter ego\u201d were also heavily involved in researching salt\nchymistry in the latter part of the seventeenth century, analyzing role\nof the salts in spa waters, as well as physiology, and iatrochymistry.19 As\nevidenced by the Royal Society Transactions, weather keeping was also a\npursuit that occupied many fellows such as Robert Moray (1608\u20131673)\nand Edmond Halley (1656\u20131742), and Jankovic has shown how meteorology was crucial to the society\u2019s Baconian research program.20 Because\nHarold Cook has characterized chemistry as the \u201cbasic analytical tool\u201d\nfor seventeenth-century investigators of anatomy and natural history, it\nseems an understanding of his chemical theories and their intellectual\ncontext will shed further light on their natural history work.21 In all of\nthese pursuits, salt chymistry played a signi\u0003cant role.\n18\nPeter Dear, \u201cTotius en Verba: Rhetoric and Authority in the Early Royal Society,\u201d Isis\n76, 2 ( June 1985), pp. 144\u201361; Michael Hunter, Science and Society in Restoration England\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981); Arthur Macgregor, The Ashmolean\nMuseum: A History of the Museum and its collection (Oxford: Ashmolean Museum, 2001);\nMarjorie Swann, Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England\n(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).\n19\nAntonio Clericuzio, Elements, Principles, and Corpuscles: A Study of Atomism and Chymistry\nin the Seventeenth Century (Dordrecht and Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001),\np. 161.

In seventeenth-century England, the\ncauses of planetary beams were considered \u201coccult,\u201d an Aristotelian\nand early modern term utilized when distinguishing \u201cqualities which\nwere evident to the senses from those which were hidden.\u201d22 After the\nRestoration, natural philosophers attempted to \u201crid the world of occult\ncauses and to explain invisible forces like solar and lunar emanations\u201d\nvia the mechanical philosophy, matter-theory, and chemical systems.23\nThis examination of occult causes extended to the tides, or the effects\nof the sunshine and moonbeams upon the seas.\nScholarly analysis of seventeenth-century tidal theories has primarily focused on Galilean, Cartesian, and Keplerian ideas, or upon the\norigins of Wallis\u2019 and Newton\u2019s gravitational models.24 Tidal theory in\n1450\u20131800, ed.

However, Thomas was best known as a \u201ctolerable poet\u201d\nwhile a student at Cambridge University and as an author of tracts on\na variety of subjects ranging from suicide, Aesop\u2019s Fables, to the history of\nheraldry.29\nBy the 1670s, Thomas Philipot\u2019s interests had shifted to natural\nphilosophy, and in 1673, he published A Phylosophical Essay, Treating of\nthe most Probable Cause of that Grand Mystery of Nature, the Flux and Re\u0003ux:\nor Flowing and Ebbing of the Sea.30 Through an extended chain of logical deduction, the majority of his treatise was devoted to a systematic\nconsideration and rejection of the myriad of pre-Newtonian theories\nof the tides, including those of Galileo and Kepler, and a synopsis of\nthe state of tidal research that included both English and continental\nworks. Philipot defended his choice to spend so much time summarizing theories, explaining that tidal models were so \u201centwin\u2019d and\ncomplicated . . . that it is a greater Dif\u0003culty to trace out and unravell\nthem, than to Subvert, or Dismantle them.\u201d31 In the last pages of this\nwork, however, Philipot made his own contribution, and proposed\na theory of the tides based on chymical reactions of sea salts and\natmospheric pressure caused by the emanations of the sun and the\nmoon on the seas.32 As Antonio Clericuzio and Allen Debus have illustrated, by the 1670s and 1680s, English scientists such as John Webster,\nThomas Sherley, and William Simpson blended the iatrochymistry of\nphysician Joan Baptista van Helmont with chemist Robert Boyle\u2019s corpuscularianism and the mechanical philosophy, applying the results to\n28\nDictionary of National Biography, 1937\u201339 ed., s.v. \u201cThomas Philipot,\u201d and s.v.\n\u201cJohn Philipot.\u201d\n29\nFor an analysis of Thomas Philipot\u2019s meditative poems, see Wolfgang Lottes, \u201c \u2018On\nthis Couch of tears\u2019: Meditationen in schwerer Krankheit von Donne, Wotton, Latewar, Isham\nund Philipot,\u201d Literatur in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, 8 (1975), pp. 56\u201371; According to\nthe DNB entry, Thomas Philipot plagiarized his father\u2019s Villare cantianum, or, Kent surveyed\nand illustrated (London: William Godbid, 1659); Thomas Philipot, Poems (London: R.A.,\n1646); Thomas Philipot, Aesop\u2019s fables, with his life: in English, French &amp; Latin (London:\nWilliam Godbid, 1666); Thomas Philipot, Self-homicide-murther, or, Some antidotes and arguments (London: W.

Iatrochymistry is a medical theory, \u0003rst associated with Paracelsus, that disease\nresults from a chemical reaction and that it can be both de\u0003ned and treated chemically. Corpuscularianism was Boyle\u2019s physical theory that supposed all matter to be\ncomposed of minute particles.\n34\nThomas Philipot, The original and growth of the Spanish monarchy united with the House\nof Austria (London: W.G., 1664); Thomas Philipot, A Historical discourse of the \u0002rst invention\nof navigation and the additional improvements of it with the probable causes of the variation of the\ncompasse (London: W.

He also \u201cdid not understand how the ebbing of the tide followed\n\nPages 73:\n56\nchapter three\nwas the tides. If we now turn to Philipot\u2019s Phylosophical Essay, we see\nPhilipot believed the \u0002ux of the sea was due to the fact:\nthere is a vitriolated, volatile or armoniack salt or spirit, that is wrap\u2019d\nup in the Bowels of the Sea and lies there clasped up and Imprison\u2019d\nin the Embraces of the \u0003xed . . . Salt, which upon its Excitation, by the\nAgitation of the Super\u0003cies of the Sea, and the opening of it by the\ncombined and complicated Impressions of the Sun and Moon, dislodges\nfrom its Inclose, and shoots it self up to the watry Margent, and drags\nalong with it, that Heap of Waters we stile the Flux.38\nJust as van Helmont believed heated blood in contact with air discharged\nits volatile salts and became breath or gas that was released into the\natmosphere, Philipot may have analogized that volatile salts were\nfreed from the \u0003xed sea salt via motion of the waves and the heated\nemanations of the sun and moon. The volatile salts were subsequently\nreleased into the air, and their motion and expansion caused the \u0002ux\nof the tides.39\nTo explain the re\u0002ux of the waters, Philipot also utilized the explanation of what he called the \u201cspring of the air\u201d which was Boyle\u2019s term\nfor atmospheric pressure. A connection between atmospheric pressure\nand planetary ef\u0002uviums was indeed proposed by Boyle, who speculated\nthat the Gravity of the Atmosphere\nmay be alter\u2019d by unseen Ef\u0002uviums . . . [as] we have often perceived by\nthe Mercurial Baroscope the Weight of the Air to be noticably increased,\nwhen we could not perceive in the Air . . . any cause to which we could\nascribe so noticeable a change.40\nBoyle thought perhaps that even \u201cthe Sun it self may not now and\nthen alter the Gravity of the Atmosphere otherwise than by its Beams\nfrom the direct attraction unless the interior of the earth contained humors which\nretreated into the earth when the tidal forces ceased, and so caused the surface of\nthe sea to descend. He also did not understand why the earth and moon did not fall\ntogether.\u201d See Harris, Manual of Tides, 398; William Gilbert, De Mundo nostro Sublunari\n(Amsterdam: Elzevir, 1651), pp. 298\u201399.\n38\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 11.\n39\nThe expansion of the volatile salts to cause the \u0002ux of the sea was similar in\nmechanism to the ability of volatile salts to agitate the animal spirits of the body.\nEnglish Helmontians in fact often \u201cadministered volatile alkaline salts distilled from\nblood to agitate restore the weakened vital spirits or archaeus of the body\u201d by their\nexpansion. Boyle himself attempted to distill the spirit of blood, which he believed was\n\u201cfully satiated with saline and spiritous parts,\u201d and thus had the therapeutic ability to\nrestore the vital spirits. See Roos, \u201cLuminaries in Medicine,\u201d pp. 453\u201354.\n40\nBoyle, Suspicions about some hidden qualities in the air, p. 45.\n\nPages 74:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n57\nor heat.\u201d41 Via a similar mechanism, Philipot proposed that the air\n\u201cascended up\u201d with the sea\u2019s \u0002ux, and \u201cupon closing and contracting\nits Face upon the Recess of those two great Luminaries, shrinks back\nagain, and with it pulls along, that mass of waters it before had elevated,\nand this produces the Re\u0002ux.\u201d42 In other words the atmospheric pressure of the sun and moon \u201cpushed back\u201d the air that had risen with\nthe \u0002ow of the tides, leading to the tides\u2019 ebb.\nTo further support his hypotheses, Philipot cited Jesuit authors such\nas Libertus Froidmont (1587\u20131653) and the polymath Athanasius\nKircher (1601/2\u20131680). Froidmont was a professor at Leuven, and\na Latin edition of his Six Books of Meteors was published at Oxford in\n1639.43 A good proportion of the \u0003fth book was devoted to considering\nsystematically hypotheses of the tides, each submitted to questiones and\ndisputationes in scholastic fashion. Philipot in fact seems to have utilized\nFroidmont\u2019s structure of argumentation and some of his content in\nthe beginning of this Phylosophical Essay when he considered other tidal\nmodels. To support his idea of chemical reactions in the air causing the\nmotion of \u0002uids, Philipot in particular cited Froidmont\u2019s observation\nof an experiment done by the Swiss physician and philologist Jacob\nZwinger (1569\u20131610). Zwinger noticed that oil of vitriol ascended\nand descended with the \u0002ux and re\u0002ux of the sea.44 Because oil of\nvitriol is extremely reactive and hygroscopic (it absorbs water), it is\nlikely Zwinger was noticing water absorption during periods of higher\nhumidity.45 Philipot then connected lunar action to saline chymistry by\n41\nBoyle, Suspicions about some hidden qualities in the air, p. 45.\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 12.\n43\nLiberti Fromondi, Meteorologicorum Libri Sex (Oxford: William Turner, 1639).\n44\nLiberti Fromondi, Meteorologicorum Libri Sex (Oxford: William Turner, 1639), p. 321.\nScribit alibudi Swingerus, oleum quoddam vitreoli esse, quod tumescit cum Luna &amp; detumescit: quid si\nigitur similis substantaie, aut qualitatis, id est, vitriolatae, ut loquuntur nostri Chymici, spritium marini\nalvei fundus obtineat?

Kircher recorded that an\ninfusion of the volatile salt, sal armoniack, \u201cplaced obliquely to receive\nthe In\u0002uence of the Moon . . . did Increase and Decrease as it held of\nan equal Correspondence, by an uninterrupted Chain of Atoms, with\nthe Flowings and Ebings of the Marine waters.\u201d46 (Sal ammoniac or\nammonium chloride is similarly hydroscopic and reacts to atmospheric\nhumidity, which may have been behind Kircher\u2019s observations of its\nincrease and decrease with the tides).47\nPhilipot also seemed to be unaware of the fact that in 1665, members\nof the Royal Society were privately testing Kircher\u2019s hypotheses. In a\nletter from Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the Society, to the writer,\nchemist, and mathematician Robert Moray, Oldenburg stated:\nKircher produces severall Experiments to evince, yt ye Moon is ye sole\ncause of those Sea-reciprocations, by a Nitrous quality and Dilating\nfaculty. . . . etc. it be experimented, if it hath not been by any of our\nOxonian friends, whether Nitrous water, mixed with common salt, exposed\nin a bason to ye Beams of ye Moon in a free open place and a cleer\nMoonshiny night, will boyle and bubble up, and ye more vehemently,\nye neerer the two Luminaries are to ye places of their Conjunction and\nOpposition.48\nFour days later, Robert Boyle commented that Moray \u201chas been here to\nwatch ye successe of ye Expt of Kerker yt you sent him concerning ye\nEbbing and \u0002owing of ye sea.\u201d49 As Stevenson has shown, Moray had\nin fact written a series of letters to Kircher about magnetism and tides\nfrom 1643 to 1646, as well as in 1653, one of which about the tides\nof the Hebrides that Kircher reprinted in the Mundus Subterraneous and\na dangerous explosive reaction.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 58 to 77 of the document, which delves deeper into the role of salts in alchemy, natural philosophy, and the early development of chemistry, focusing on Johann Glauber&#x27;s theories, particularly about his *sal mirabile* and his other chemical works:

1. <strong>Johann Glauber&#x27;s Sal Mirabile</strong>:
   - Glauber (1604–1670) explored the use of sodium sulphate, which became known as Glauber&#x27;s salt, and its significance in generating minerals and metals. He also emphasized the connection between salt and sulphuric compounds in mining and alchemical processes. [*Philosophical Furnaces*, 1651, p. 60](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=60).

2. <strong>Medicinal Virtues of Sal Mirabile</strong>:
   - Glauber believed that this substance had great medicinal powers, especially when heated with gold. He referred to his *green lyon* (vitriol of gold), which he considered a rejuvenating elixir. This concept connects salt to early modern ideas of health and rejuvenation [*Philosophical Furnaces*, 1651, p. 62](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=62).

3. <strong>Glauber and Early Mining Practices</strong>:
   - Glauber&#x27;s works also intersected with mining and metallurgy, where salts were believed to be essential for the maturation of metals. He viewed sulphuric acid as a &quot;metallical seed&quot; and emphasized the role of sulphurous salts in metal formation. [p. 60](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=60).

4. <strong>Helmontian Influence and Chymical Theories</strong>:
   - Glauber&#x27;s ideas were influenced by Van Helmont’s views on water and salts. Glauber acknowledged water as the universal matrix, an idea that later influenced English chymists like Robert Boyle. Helmont believed salts were &quot;offspring of the waters&quot; and could become volatile. [p. 64](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=64).

The solid glass\nobject had a bulbous end which tapered into a curved glass tail, and\nthese objects exhibited unusual properties of strength and fragility. The\nformation of the drops created tremendous stress between the outside\nlayer, cooled by the water, and the inside which was warm; due to the\ntremendous surface tension of the glass, the head withstood hammering\non an anvil.58 However, breaking the tail resulted in the shattering of\nthe entire drop into \u0003ne powder because the glass released the internal\nstress with such power.59 These drops were utilized in practical jokes\nby Charles II; the King would have a subject hold the bulb end in the\npalm of his hand, and then break off the top, giving the victim a small\nbut harmless explosion in a closed hand.60 Indeed, Philipot referred to\nthese drops as \u201cGreatricks [great-tricks] glasses.\u201d61\nAs with the tides, there was a multiplicity of interpretations of the\nphenomenon, already correctly grasped in principle by Robert Hooke in\nhis Micrographia.62 Philipot however believed the drops shattered because\nof a chemical reaction. When the tail was snapped off,\n57\nThe diarist Samuel Pepys stated he was \u0003rst shown the drops or \u201cchymical\nglasses,\u201d which he had \u201cheard talk of \u201d by Peter Honywood on 13 January 1662.\nHe wrote the glasses \u201cbreak all to dust by breaking off a little small end, which is a\n\u201cgreat mystery.\u201d See the Diary of Samuel Pepys, ed.

He realized that one of the major obstacles to\nthe formulation of mechanical or chemical tidal theories was to \u0003nd an\nexplanation for the fact that smaller bodies of water such as the \u201cEuxine, Baltick, and Caspian Seas\u201d do not exhibit tidal behavior.64 (Many\ninland seas are virtually tideless because the entering strait is too narrow to allow the in\u0002ux or out\u0002ow of suf\u0003cient tidal waters).65 Philipot\u2019s\nexplanation was that rivers \u201cperpetually disgorge themselves into those\nSeas above said,\u201d emptying \u0003xed salts from underground caverns and\nmines, where minerals and salts were generated by mother earth.66 As\na result, the volatile salts in these seas were \u201ccheck\u2019d and depress\u2019d\u201d by\n\u0003xed salts of sulphur, nitre, and bitumen.67 And, so \u201cbenumb\u2019d\u201d were\nthe volatile salts that it was \u201cimpossible for the united In\u0002uence of the\nSun and Moon, to excite their so stupi\u0003ed vigour.\u201d68 Philipot may have\nbeen in\u0002uenced in his ideas again by Froidmont, who immediately\n64\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 13. \u201cEuxine\u201d or \u201cEuxinic\u201d refers to areas in which\nlimited circulation of water has produced stagnant conditions, leading to deposit of\nblack oil shale. Philipot likely is referring to the Black Sea, known for its oil deposits\nin the seventeenth century. See Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989 (ed. J.A.\nSimpson and E.S.C. Weiner), OED Online. Oxford University Press. &lt;http://oed.\ncom&gt;, s.v. \u201cEuxinic.\u201d The Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, receives water\nfrom several rivers, such as the Volga, Ural, and Emba in the northern and central\nparts of the sea, but it has no outlet. It actually has, contrary to Philipot, some tides,\nranging from 70 cm. to 3 m. See Ramiz Mamedov, \u201cOn the Level: The continuing\nproblem of the Caspian,\u201d in The Caspian Times, www.caspiantimes.com, p. 4. Philipot\nwas however mostly correct in thinking the Baltic has not tides; it actually has a very\nsmall tidal variation. \u201cIt is greatest in the inner part of the Gulf of Finland, where the\ndifference between high and low tide is 20 cm.\u201d See The Encyclopedia of Oceanography,\ned.

Boyle wrote \u201cthe Sea derives its saltness from the\nSalt that is dissolved in it . . .; But I take that Saltness to be supplied, not only from\nRocks, and other Masses of Salt . . . but Also from the Salt, which the Rains, Rivers\nand other Waters dissolve in their passage through divers parts of the Earth, and\nat length carry along with them into the Sea.\u201d See Robert Boyle, Tracts Consisting of\nObservations About the Saltness of the Sea (Oxford: E. Flesher, 1674), p. 15. The idea that\nunderground mines constantly generated minerals, serving as the womb of the Earth\nMother, is a common conceit in Paracelsian and Helmontian thinking. See Carolyn\nMerchant, The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scienti\u0002c Revolution (San Francisco:\nHarper, 1990), pp. 20\u201341.\n67\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 13.\n68\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 13.\n\nPages 81:\n64\nchapter three\nbefore his discussion of vitriolic oil mentioned the lack of tides in the\nDead Sea, termed by the Roman Naturalist Pliny as well as the Book of\nGenesis as the Lacus Aphaltites or \u201cLake of Asphalt,\u201d for its tremendous\nquantity of bitumen and \u0003xed salts.69\nAs he concluded his treatise, described as a \u201cfaint result of my\npen,\u201d Philipot evinced a gentlemanly desire to use his work to serve\nhis fellow citizens, proclaiming he was certain that \u201cnew Discoveries\u201d\nwould improve his \u201ctheories to greater advantage of the public.\u201d70 In\nthe interim, he advised his readers with a maxim from Horace: \u201cSi\nquid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum,\u201d or \u201cIf you\nhave ideas better than these of mine, share them openly; if not, use\nthese as I do.\u201d71 His systematic consideration and rejection of nine\nother tidal theories\u2014ranging from Homer\u2019s view they were caused by\nwhirlpools to Kepler\u2019s idea that the tides occurred because the sea was\nas a breathing animal (which Philipot dismisses because could not see\non \u201cwhich coast these prodigious lungs are located\u201d (!)\u2014illustrated the\nmultiplicity of ideas about the waters\u2019 \u0002ux and re\u0002ux.72 Philipot was\nthus a transitional \u0003gure, providing an explanation for the tides during\nthe height of iatrochymistry\u2019s popularity, only to see such theories over69\nFroidmont, Meteorologicorum, p. 321. Hoc tamen me retinet quod Asphalities sive mare\nmortuum, bitumine stans et plenissimum, aestum tamen non sentit. Oportet ergo aliter temperatum\nesse bitumen, ut ad Lunam se moveat.

Evans, 1809\u201312; London, 1598\u20131600) vol. 1, pp. 134\u2013135. Hakluyt\nused the examples of whirlpools near the Hebrides, stating it was but one of four in\n\u201copposite quarters of the world, from whence many does coniecture that as well the\n\u0002owing of the sea, as the blasts of the winde, haue their \u0003rst originall.\u201d In the fourth\nbook of his Harmonics (1619), Kepler states that the tides are akin to the breathing of\nterrestrial animals and \u0003shes. See Johannes Kepler, Opera Omnia, ed. Christian Frisch.\n8 vols. (Frankfurt and Erlangen: Heyder et Zimmer, 1865\u201371), vol. 5, p. 255. However,\nin his earlier Introduction to the Motions of the Planet Mars (1609) Kepler noted that the\nattractive forces exercised by earth and moon upon each other are proportional to\ntheir masses.

Although there have been no analyses of Lister\u2019s works\non spas, there have been many studies of early modern English debates concerning\nthe chemistry of hot springs as well as their economic impact. For instance, the most\nfamous seventeenth-century medical debate was that engendered by Dr. Robert Wittie\u2019s\n(1613?\u20131684) Scarborough spaw (1660) a work in which he advocated the mineral waters\nat Scarborough as a cure-all; his claim was challenged by other physicians such as William Simpson (\u0002. 1665\u20131677) and after a series of dueling pamphlets, the controversy,\nwhich essentially centered around Galenic vs. Paracelsian medical cures, was carried\nout in the Philosophical Transactions.

As we have seen in\nthe last chapter, some chymists claimed that there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d or formative salt believed to be responsible for minerallogenesis\nand other types of matter formation, and there were contenders for the\nidentity of this salt including nitre and vitriol. The vitriolic liquid or spirit\nof vitriol (sulphuric acid) called \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur\u2019 was believed by Glauber and\nother early modern mining authors to be a sign of the presence of mineral ores, \u201cwith which sulphurous exhalations were also associated.\u201d83\nWhile Lister agreed with his colleagues about the composition of vitriol,\nwe will see that he dismissed the idea that vitriol was the universal acid\nsalt responsible for mineral formation. Lister also disagreed that there\nwas any particular sole active element responsible for mineral formation, arguing in particular against Van Helmont who assigned water\nthat role. To support his assertions against Van Helmont, we will see\nthat Lister incorporated the empirical work of early modern chemists\nin the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, speci\u0003cally utilizing the Observations on the Mineral Waters of France (1684) written by their chief chemist\nSamuel Du Clos (d. 1715).\nAs these Helmontian aqueous theories of mineral formation arose in\nthe seventeenth century, other chemical authors held \u201cmineral exhalations as an explanation for the generation of . . . minerals and of the\nvaporous ef\u0002uxes thought to issue from ore-deposits.\u201d84 Lister was one\nof these authors, believing that the volatile exhalations of pyrites and its\nvitriol in the air were important in the transformation of matter, and he\nsubscribed to the sixteenth and seventeenth-century theory of witterung\nor ore exhalations as an explanation for the formation of minerals.85\nScratching or crushing pyrites does result in a sulphurous smell, and\nLister claimed pyrites and its vitriol gave off a \u201cwarm vapour\u201d that\nwas \u201clargely sulphurous, pungent, and in\u0002ammable,\u201d identifying vitriol\nas volatile.86 Despite his allegiance to the theories of witterung, we will\nillustrate that Lister made use of his interests in natural history to go\none step beyond them, postulating that the sulphurous exhalations from\npyrites were responsible for the heating of hot springs, and meteorological and geological effects.\n83\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 217.\nJohn A.

Lister may have taken his cue from Bath physician\nEdward Jorden (1569\u20131632) who \u201cstrongly advocated the examination\nof their crystals\u201d to identify dissolved minerals in spas; Dr. Tancred\nRobinson (1657\u20131748) and John Ray, Lister\u2019s colleagues, also remarked\nin correspondence that Anton von Leeuwenhoek also \u201chath observed a\ngreat variety of \u0003gures\u201d in microscopic examination of salts.89 Tancred\nRobinson wrote to Lister concerning the De Fontibus:\nThis afternoon I spent some hours with Mr. Boyle, who gives you his\nmost humble service, and is as proud of your good opinion, as you can\npossibly bee of his; hee hath try\u2019d most of the experiments of your last\nbook, and tells me that hee \u0003nds you a very faithfull and Authentick writer,\nhee shew\u2019d mee this day the severall crystallizations of those salts, which\n87\nWeekly Memorials for the Ingenious (London: Henry Faithorne and John Kersey, 1683/4),\nno. 50, Jan 15, pp. 376\u201382.

As he concentrated on utilizing structure to classify animals\nand insects in his other treatises, it is not surprising he would utilize the\nsame methods in his chemical work [Figure 3]. Because Lister primarily\nused detailed visual observation of crystal structure to classify salts,\nhe cautioned chemists who were deceived by impure water samples in\nwhich there was \u201cconjunction of several pure primary salts, from which\nconfusion arises regarding the true and natural shape of crystals.\u201d91\nAfter his classi\u0003cation of common salts, Lister turned to an analysis\nof salts in English mineral waters, and concluded from isolation by\ndehydration and crystal analysis that only two types were present: nitrum\ncalcarium derived from limestone (calcium carbonate) and common sea\nsalt. Lister thought that the presence of sea salts in English mineral\nsprings was easily explained via the runoff of sea water inland. But nitre\nof lime or what he called nitrum calcarium was a different case. Lister\ncommented that nitrum calcarium was produced by the exposure of limestone to air. This was \u0003rst because \u201cwhere there is nitre of lime, there\nis always limestone to be found,\u201d and because Lister observed that\nno salt whatever grows from limestone immediately after it has been slaked\nby the application of heat, but the same stone produces an abundance of\nsalt, whether it [i.e. the stone] has been untreated or heated, whilst forming\nthe walls or roof of some house; it then grows together to form crystals\nof its own kind.92\nMost likely Lister was observing the formation of potassium carbonate or saltpetre crystals on walls that had been whitened by limestone,\nsimilar to the formation of nitre crystals in limestone saltpeter caves.\nLister noted that nitrum calcarium could also not be formed by steeping\nlimestone in water, and indeed nitrate crystals will not form in areas\nof excess humidity.\n90\nMS Lister 34, Bodleian Library, Oxford University, London April 12, 1683.

Unlike his predecessor Van Helmont,\nor Johann Glauber, Lister was particularly keen to demonstrate, that\nlike limestone salts, vitriol could only form via the exposure of pyrites\nto air\u2014that nitre of lime was produced \u201cone and the same way as\nvitriol.\u201d93 Lister wrote:\nThe creation of vitriol makes the whole matter clear. Its \u0003rst eruption\nfrom pyrites is exceedingly premature, if it occurs in contact with air;\nbut, as time proceeds, it becomes a little more mature. And yet fullyformed vitriol is not produced from any ferrous stone until after its due\nmaturity which it \u0003nally reaches after a continuous period of development. If however it [a pyrite] kept perpetually under water I am not\nyet convinced that it will be productive of any salt. Certainly no vitriol\nwhatever will be generated.94\nIn his assertion, Lister wished to not only to prove the ef\u0003cacy of air or\nexhalations as the source of chemical reactions and effects for reasons\nwhich will be enumerated below, but argued against the Helmontian\nbelief that vitriol and its acid, the \u201chungry\u201d or \u201chermaphroditical salt\u201d\nwas the \u201cseminal constituent of mineral waters and metal ores.\u201d95 Lister\n\u0003rst cited Helmont\u2019s Oriatricke or Physick Re\u0002ned which stated that \u201cthe\nmost excellent Vitriol, grows naturally in Mines, wherein Nature hath\nbrought forth that hungry Salt, corroding a fertile vein [of brassy marcasite] and being dissolved in the liquor of a licking Fountain, which\nafterward Cauldrons do boyl into Vitriol.\u201d96 Lister then continued, \u201cI\nam unhappy with Helmontius\u2019 explanation of the generation of vitriol.\nHe would have it that salt is formed naturally in water itself, this salt\nbeing variously known as \u2018juice,\u2019 \u2018a certain universal spirit,\u2019 \u2018the embryonate,\u2019 \u2018the corrosive,\u2019 \u2018the hermaphroditic\u2019 (for it is by these and other\n93\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 51.

First, he believed it was \u201cpointless to state\nthat corrosive salt exist[ed] anywhere\u201d since \u201cup to this point it has\nno characteristics and is not even recognizable.\u201d98 His observations of\npyrites indicated that no vitriol was produced when marcasites were in\nwater.99 Further, Lister did a series of experiments in which he failed to\nsee corrosion when he subjected many types of iron, including hematite,\nthe \u201csoftest\u201d form of iron, to corrosive saline or acidic solutions such\nas aqua fortis or spirit of nitre.100\nHis refutation of Helmont\u2019s theory that vitriol was formed in water\nwas also in\u0002uenced by the work of French physician-in-ordinary Samuel\nCotreau Du Clos, the Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, which\nwas translated into English in 1684.101 Du Clos\u2019 work was a systematic\nevaluation of the chemical content of all spa waters in France under\nthe auspices of the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, part of a\nlarger project of chemical research which began in 1666 to \u201cdetermine rigorously the \u2018true principles of mixts [chemical compound]\u2019\nby analyzing such bodies and by generating them and observing their\nproperties.\u201d102 Lister had been to France four times; his \u0003rst voyage was\n97\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 57.

It is thus not surprising\nthat Lister would have been in\u0002uenced by Du Clos\u2019 pamphlet, as his\nstudy in Montpellier coincided with the beginning of the Academy\u2019s\nchemical trials. Lister\u2019s De Fontibus was also advertised in the endpapers\nof the English edition of Du Clos\u2019 work, leading to the possibility that\nLister was the translator; in the opinion of Lister\u2019s biographer Raymond Stearns, Lister\u2019s French would have certainly been up to the task,\nalthough he had trouble at the French Opera, \u201cnot being so Good a\nFrenchman, as to understand them when Sung.\u201d103 Lister remarked in\nthe De Fontibus that:\nit is not stated that mature vitriol can be drawn from any of our mineral\nsprings as far as I know.

As a practicing physician himself,\nLister would have been interested in such arguments. In 1668\u201369, physician William\nSimpson wrote the Hydrologia Chymica, a work which \u201csought to identify the \u2018cures\u2019\nassociated with a plethora of \u2018Sanative Waters\u2019 in England and Europe\u201d and which\nalso sparked a number of publications about spa waters in the Philosophical Transactions\nby other doctors such as Robert Wittie, Daniel Foot, and Nathaniel Highmore. Simpson\nbelieved the active ingredient in the waters was alum, and while Wittie believed vitriol\nwas \u201cuseful in moist diseases,\u201d its hot and biting nature drying super\u0002uous humidity,\nhe also thought nitre was the principal mineral in the water. (William Simpson, Hydrologia chymica or, The chymical anatomy of the Scarbrough, and other spaws in York-Shire: wherein\nare interspersed, some animadversions upon Dr. Wittie\u2019s lately published treatise of the Scarbrough\nSpaw . . .

One of\nthe fellows of the Royal Society, Daniel Coxe, was especially interested\nin palingenesis, and the production of volatile salts from plants via their\ncalcinations. Given Lister\u2019s interest in botany and chemistry, Oldenburg\nmade special mention of Coxe\u2019s work to Lister in correspondence in\n1674. In a 1673 letter to Oldenburg, Lister himself already was \u201ccon\u0003dent from a passage in Mr. Boile, yt he &amp; others are masters of ye\nway of Extracting ye volatile salts out of all plants\u201d; Lister also mentioned he had been performing such chemical extractions \u201chere this\n12 yeares.\u201d106 Coxe\u2019s work on palingenics and the \u201cplentifull\u201d nature of\npyrite salts in particular also convinced Tancred Robinson that \u201ctheir\nfermentations, breathings, emanations, and changes . . . send[ing] forth\ntheir secret ef\u0002uviums\u201d could produce many \u201cfruitful\u201d effects.107\nFor Lister, one of these effects of these volatile salts in the atmosphere\nwas the production of fossils. Past scholarship has noted the debate that\nLister had with John Ray about the nature of fossils, Ray believing\nthey were remnants of past animal and plant life, and Lister convinced\nthat fossils were not always mineralized remains of living creatures, but\ncould be minerals created spontaneously by nature; as he put it, some\nlittle fossilized shells could \u201cspring from rocks and others are actual\nSeventeenth-Century England,\u201d Medical History 23 (1979): 191\u2013214.

He thus believed\nall fossils contained iron marcasites, proven by running a magnet over\nthem, and that pyrites could be detected in a like manner. Further, in\nDe Fontibus, Lister claimed that \u201ccalcarious nitre, both when it is springing into being and when it is mature, and likewise of . . . imperfectly\nformed vitriol,\u201d is the \u201cunique cause of petri\u0003cation in every case.\u201d109\nVan Helmont argued that in the case of fossils, a petrifying and germinating seed in mineral waters produced shells \u201cclothed in a crust as\na result of rancid material from the depths.\u201d110 But as we have seen,\nLister denied Van Helmont\u2019s belief that water was the source of all\nother matter through the seminal power of speci\u0003c seeds implanted in\nit. Instead, Lister claimed that the seed of fossils, is\npropagated not so much by sexual union [of the seeds] as by the actual\nrancidity from the depths. . . . The layers of rock are produced under the\nearth from rancid stink arising from the rocks. I am not here enquiring\nhow layers of rock are produced, but if we suppose that they have existed\nfrom the creation of the world the question is posed as to the source of\nthe petri\u0003cation of plants, animals and now even the rocks themselves. I\ndeclare that we are generally deceived by what has a similar appearance\nto certain germinating rocks, as though all other kinds of rocks were\nproduced today from one and the same cause as was once the case. Yet\nas far as I have been able to observe everything that petri\u0003es is either\npyrites or some kind of limestone and nothing else. These two petri\u0003ers\nproduced by the continual germination of salt are after their own fashion volatile, and when admitted into intermediary substances, dead as\nwell as alive, they combine and are compacted of their own nature, and\ngenerally even preserve the shapes of the animals, and their qualities, at\nleast to some extent.111\nIn other words, the \u201cstink\u201d coming from the rocks was the sulphureous\nvapour arising from the \u201ccontinual germination\u201d of salts of vitriol from\nthe pyrites and calcarious nitre arising from the limestone. These vola108\nLister, De Fontibus, part two, p. 78. Each of the two parts of Lister\u2019s work is\nseparately paginated. I will indicate if part two is providing the quotation in subsequent endnotes.\n109\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 71.\n110\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 77.\n111\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 76.\n\nPages 94:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n77\ntile salts combined with intermediary substances, which could be dead\nplants or animals, or just dead neighboring substances to form different petri\u0003ed shapes. Just as Glauber believed his sal mirabile, sodium\nsulphate, was involved in the petri\u0003cation of wood, Lister thought\nthat \u201cwhat the vitriol does to the iron is pure petri\u0003cation.\u201d112 Another\nsulphurous compound was responsible for petri\u0003cation of all inorganic\nand organic matter.\nLister also apparently thought there were other \u201cfruitful effects\u201d of\nthe emanations of the vitriolic salts from pyrites, in his De Fontibus\nclaiming these salty emanations were the cause of the heating of\nmineral springs, and the production of rainstorms, earthquakes, and\nvolcanoes. In chapter nine of the De Fontibus, Lister hypothesized \u0003rst\nthat the cause of heat of hot springs was \u201cderived from salts produced\nby pyrites . . . or activated by pyrites itself.\u201d113 As nitrum calcarium was also\nproduced from limestone via exposure to the air, much in the same way\nas vitriolic salts from pyrites, he thought lime salts could also contribute\nheating vapours to hot springs. The abundance of limestone around\npyrite minerals, as well as mists around the springs also led him to this\nconclusion.114\nIn asserting the centrality of pyrites in heating mineral springs, Lister\n\u0003rst claimed that the warm sulphurous gases produced by vitriolic salts\nfrom pyrites was evidenced by mine explosions in which gases would\naccumulate, and the fact that mineshafts and underground tunnels of\nhot springs were \u201cvery warm\u201d in the \u201cwhole of winter.\u201d115 There was\nalso no other substance prevalent around mineral springs that he knew\nof apart from volatile salts from pyrites and limestone that gave off a\n112\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 72.\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 76. [Thermarum ratio, e salibus Pyritae et lapidis Calcarii nascentibus,\nsive ipsae Pyritis et lapide Calcario vegetantibus deducitur.]\n114\nOn page 79 of the De Fontibus, Lister wrote: \u201cI can prove that a warm gas is\nproduced in like manner from active limestone in the following way. Almost all springs\nand wells (for most of them are considered medicinal to the extent to which they\ncontain this or that salt) are especially warm at times of fairly severe frost, and are\nparticularly noticeable for the way in which they give off an exhalation consisting of\na very dense moist vapour, just like hot springs.\u201d [Halitum quoque calidum a lapide calcario\nVegetante, similiter ferri, sic probo. Universos fere Fontes, puteosque (nam plerique, eatenus medicati\nexistimati sunt, quatenus hoc vel ille sale, copiosius imbuuntur) praecipue vehementioris gelu tempore\ntepidos esse, atque admodum copiose etiam conspicuos, densissimo vapore humido, Thermarum instar,\nhalitus emittere.]\n115\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 77. [Item illud universo consensus testantur Metallarii, puteos subterraneos, tota hyeme, geluque praecipue tempore, admodum tepidos esse.]\n113\n\nPages 95:\n78\nchapter three\ngaseous vapour.116 Lister also believed that in \u201cwet, moist and chilly\nplaces,\u201d the activation of pyrite salts was \u201cparticularly promoted,\u201d\nprobably due to his observation of the increased oxidation of pyrites in\nhumid and oxygen-rich air.117 Lister was likely in\u0002uenced by the early\nmodern concept of \u201cwitterung,\u201d described by Christian Berward in his\nInterpres Phraseologiae Metullarugicae (Frankfurt 1684) as the \u201cvapour or\nexhalation which at times rises out of the earth from rich [ore] veins,\u201d\nespecially at the time of rain storms, and as we have seen, it was associated by Glauber with sulphurous vapors.118 As has been well-established,\nthe early modern period saw an in\u0002ux of German mining engineers\nand entrepreneurs into England; Lister himself referred to Glauber and\nGeorg Agricola extensively in his manuscript and published works.119\nLister\u2019s connection of volatile salts from pyrites and limestone with the\nheating of mineral waters was also in\u0002uenced by the Du Clos\u2019 Observations. In speculating about the effects of spa waters, Du Clos had written\nthat \u201cit may be that some Mineral Vapours or Exhalations do mix with\ncommon Waters . . . and that these Waters are impregnated with their\nQualities, and of some other Volatile Salts not Concrete, elevated in\nthese dry Exhalations of humid Vapours.\u201d120 Du Clos also argued that\n116\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 80.

Burt actually takes issue with traditional historiography that argues that German experts introduced any unknown or\nradically improved techniques for the mining of non-ferrous metallic ores, but he does\nacknowledge they were \u201cworld leaders in the arts of the industry,\u201d and had extensive\ntechnological in\u0002uence in the copper industry. In chapter six of his manuscript, \u201cOn\nthe Method of the History of Iron,\u201d which is devoted to pyrites (pp. 43\u201347), Lister\nrefers repeatedly to Glauber\u2019s A description of new philosophical furnaces, or, A new art of\ndistilling divided into \u0002ve parts: whereunto is added a description of the Tincture of gold or The true\naurum potabile: also the \u0002rst part of the Mineral work, set forth and published for the sakes of them\nthat are studious of the truth (London: T. Williams, 1651).\n120\nDu Clos, Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, p. 4.\n\nPages 96:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n79\nhot springs grew warm speci\u0003cally from hot moist vapours volatilizing\nfrom substances like pyritic vitriol, and not from the substances being\ncombusted themselves.121 Paraphrasing Du Clos, Lister continued in\nthe De Fontibus: \u201cThe water of the hot springs, when placed on a \u0003re,\nalso required the same time to boil as ordinary cold water: from this\nit is clear that the hot springs were not heated by some underground\n\u0003re.\u201d122 Additionally, Lister also cited Du Clos\u2019 conclusion that when\nwater from hot springs was\ntaken into the mouth they do not burn it as much as ordinary water which\nhas been heated over a stove to the same degree of heat. This seems to\nbe due to the thinness of the substance [the exhalations] by which hot\nsprings are heated; just as the \u0002ame produced by brandy does not burn\nthe hand as much as a burning coal placed on it.123\nLister then turned to proving the activation of pyrites in the presence\nof moisture by analyzing their role in the cause of rainstorms. According to the De Fontibus, thunderstorms occurred not only because of\nthe evaporation of the waters by sunlight, but primarily because of a\npartnership between moist vapours engendered by animal and plant\nbreath and sulphurous exhalations from the volatile salts of pyrites\nand limestone.\nTo understand this mechanism of thunderstorms more thoroughly, it\nis necessary to examine what Lister believed about the breath of plants\nand animals. Although the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus\nclaimed that plants only had an insensitive Vegetative soul, and thus only\n121\nDu Clos, Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, pp. 115\u2013116; Lister, De Fontibus, p. 80.\n122\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 81.

Du Clos writes \u201cThat Hot Mineral Waters have no more Disposition to\nBoyl on the Fire than Common Cold Waters, there being as much time requir\u2019d to\ncause the one to boyl as the other.

3. <strong>Van Helmont (1580–1644)</strong>: His belief that all matter derived from water and that minerals, including fossils, were formed from vital seeds in water. Lister contested this view, suggesting instead that fossilization was due to volatile salts from pyrites. [p. 93](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=93).

After ten days time, he found in the bottle where the mint was,\nonly \u0003ve ounces and four drachms of water remaining, and no more so that there was\none pound two ounces and six drachms spent, the mint weighting scarce two drachms\nmore than at \u0003rst. From the other Glass, where water was put of the same weight,\nand no mint, he found the Sun had exhaled near one ounce of water, and therefore\nconcluded it drew but so much out of the \u0003rst glass, at least no more: So that allowing one ounce for what the Sun had exhaled, there was in those ten days spent by the\nmint, one pound one ounce six drachms of water; and the mint being increased in\nweight only two drachms, \u2018twas plain the mint had purely expired in those two days,\none pound one ounce and four drachms, that is, each day above an ounce and half,\nwhich is more than the weight of the whole mint. Whence he concluded that what\nMalphigius so wonders at in his Book De Bombyce, viz. that those Animals will sometimes eat in one day, more than the weight of their bodies, is out-done by every sprig\nof mint, and most other Herbs in the Field, which every summers day attract more\nnourishment than their own weight amounts too. Which the same ingenious person at\nleast questions not (and therefore wishes trials may be made) of the Tithymali, Esulae,\nand especially of Pinguicula and Ros Solis, which last sucks up moisture faster than the\nSun can exhale it, and is bedewed all over at Noon-day, notwithstanding its power: Nor\ndoubts he but that Wormwood, and all other Plants that are very hot, and of strong\nsmells, expire as much, if not more than the Mint.\u201d All of the plants (except Wormwood) mentioned by Plot produce liquids that could be interpreted as dew. Ros Solis\nwas Drosera rotundifolia, or Sun-Dew, a carnivorous plant noted for its dew on its leaves\nthat intensi\u0003ed with the sun; Pinguicula was known as butterwort, another carnivorous\nplant with mucilage drops on its leaves to catch insects, apparently interpreted by Plot\nas dew. Tithymali and esulae are species of spurge that produces a milky latex from roots\nand stems when injured. For descriptions of these plants, see John Gerard, Herball or\nGeneral Historie of Plantes (1613) (New York: Dover Publications, 1975).\n129\n\nPages 99:\n82\nchapter three\nthink . . . from the daily and constant breath of that Plant, the Trade or\nTropic Winds do in great part arise.130\nHe also hypothesized that plant breath was also primarily moist; Lister\nused as evidence that night dews and mists from springs, rivers, and the\nsea also arose \u201clargely from the condensed breath of plants.\u201d131 And the\nmoisture of plant breath combined with Pyrites created rain. Although\nLister acknowledged that rains were \u201cexhaled as a result of the heat of\nthe Sun\u201d on the ocean, he considered the condensations of the moist\n\u201cvapour both of Pyrites and limestone\u201d found underground in mines\nas well as that from \u201cespecially the vegetation growing on Pyrites and\nlimestone\u201d to be the \u201cgreatest material for rain.\u201d132 Lister further commented that violent rain occurred when the vapour of pyrites and their\nvitriolic salts were mixed\n130\nLister, \u201cCertain Observations,\u201d p. 494. Sea Lentil or Sargasso weed, is a proli\u0003c\nbrown seaweed of the genus Sargassum, and was described in the Philosophical Transactions\nby Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753). This lush plant covers an area of Sargasso Sea that is\nat the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, often having \u0002oating layers 1\u20132 feet thick.

Although\nLister seems to be saying the physical breathing of plants causes the trade winds, it\nmay be possible that he thought the volatile salts contained in plant breath may have\nbeen behind the production of winds. Sargasso weed was very salty in taste, which\nalso may have some bearing on Lister\u2019s theory.\n131\nLister, De Fontibus, pp. 87, pp. 89\u201390. In these pages, Lister\u2019s idea that plant breath\nwas responsible for dews led him to consider the use of it for water puri\u0003cation at\nsea, a much-debated problem in the seventeenth-century English navy. Because Lister\nbelieved the condensation of plant breath produced water, he did an experiment in\nwhich he placed sea weed, some with roots, some adhering to stones, in a \u201cglass bodie\u201d;\nthe \u201cglass bodie being full, I put thereon a head with a Beck, and adapted a Receiver\nthereto . . . from these Plants did distill dayly . . . a fresh, very sweet and potable water.\u201d\nAfter urging further experimentation and how his discovery \u201cmay well prove most\ndesirable and useful for sailors,\u201d Lister then went on to speculate that sea water was\nthe only \u201celement of water created\u201d in Genesis before any Animal or Vegetable was\ncreated, or the Sun itself;\u201d over time the \u201cvapours of Plants and the Breath of Animals\nand the Exhalations raised by the Sun\u201d created the fresh water in Rivers.\u201d\n132\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 90.

Further, in early modern German mining\nliterature, ore exhalations due to witterung were implicated in meteorological effects such as thunder and lightening.136 Referring to an article\nhe wrote in the Philosophical Transactions, Lister also enumerated several\nrecorded instances by Aristotelian scholar Julius Scaliger (1484\u20131558)\nand author of \u201cbooks of secrets\u201d Giordano Cardano (1501\u201376) of \u201cIron\nto have fallen in great masses, and also in powder after the manner of\nrain, out of the Air\u201d indicating by analogy that because iron pyrites\nwere involved in meteor showers, they would be involved in rain showers\nas well.137 Lister then remarked that according to William Gilbert\u2019s De\nMagnete (1600) that presumably these pyrite-rich meteors, which were\n133\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 83.

Hales wrote Vegetable Staticks (1727)\nin which he measured the rate of plant transpiration, so it would not\nbe surprising if he were familiar with Lister\u2019s works.145 As Cohen has\nnoted, the antiquarian and biographer of Newton, Reverend William\nStuckley (1687\u20131785) took notes on some papers presented in the Royal\nSociety in 1752, in which Hales:\ngives an experiment of putting some pyrites stone, with some aqua fortis\n[concentrated nitric acid (HNO3)], into a vessel set in water, and covered\nwith a large glass, whose mouth must be immersed in the water. A brisk\nfermentation arises, a black cloud, and a destruction of some quantity\nof air . . . Then suddenly taking up the glass out of the water, and letting\nin fresh air, a new ebullition arises . . . From this experiment the doctor\napprehends that the cause of earthquakes is much illustrated. He says\nsulphureous vapour arises out of the earth generated probably by the\npyrites abounding therein . . . through cracks and chinks of the gaping\nearth. The vapours \u0002y into the upper regions of the air, where they meet\nwith pure and uncorrupted air, clouds intervening like as in the glass\nreceiver, they ingage with violence . . . through the clouds, and cause a\nprodigious tumult above . . . These concussions in the air act upon the\nsurface of the earth and cause earthquakes.146\n144\nLister, De Fontibus, pp. 78\u20139.

Hales indeed would have observed an exothermic reaction (brisk fermentation).\nThe sulphurous vapours he reported were most likely sulphur dioxide produced from\nthe reaction of pyrites with oxygen: 4 FeS2 + 1102 o\u0003 2Fe2O3 + 8 SO2, or just the\nproduction of free sulphur, as enumerated below. The reaction that Hale described was\nlikely (assuming some pyrites were iron-copper pyrites, as he does not distinguish):\nCuFeS2 + 4 HNO3 = Cu(NO3)2 + Fe(NO3)2 + 2 H+ + 2 S(solid) OR in word form:\nIron-copper pyrites + nitric acid = Copper nitrate and iron nitrate and hydrogen\nions with solid sulphur.\n\nPages 103:\n86\nchapter three\nIn a like fashion, Lister also mentioned in an article in the Philosophical\nTransactions that volcanoes were \u201cMountains made up in great part\nof Pyrites\u201d because of the \u201cquantities of Sulphure thence sublimed,\nand the Application of the Load-stone to the ejected Cinder.\u201d147 He\nmay have received this notion from The Vulcanoes (1669), which was an\nEnglish summary of Athanasius Kircher\u2019s Mundus Subterraneous. Kircher\nexplained, \u201csulphureous . . . spirits, which lodged there [in subterranean\ncaves] . . . at length ends in a new food and nourishment of the \u0003re.\u201d148\nKircher also claimed that \u201csulphur . . . insinuated into the pores of the\nCalx [limestone] or Calcined Lime\u201d where it \u201cadministers that perpetual\nand everlasting fuel and food of Fire\u201d; he also speculated that vitriol and\nsal ammoniac might play a role in the production of lava.149 We have seen\nearlier that Lister thought limestone might play a role in concert with\npyrites in producing the heat of hot springs; his concern with \u201ccaukestone,\u201d which he termed \u201ca very odd mineral,\u201d may have been suggested\nby Kircher\u2019s speculations.150 Finally, to answer objections that England\nhad a good quantity of pyrites, but little volcanic activity, Lister claimed\nthat in areas such as Mount Vesuvius experienced more volcanic eruptions because \u201cthe Pyrites of the Vulcano\u2019s or burning Mountains may\nbe more Sulphurious then ours. And indeed it is plain, that some of\nours in England are very lean.\u201d151\nIn the frontispiece of his De Fontibus, Lister included a quote from\nPliny\u2019s Natural History: Tales sunt aquae, qualis terra per quam \u0003uunt, or waters\ntake their nature from the strata through which they \u0002ow. Understanding\nthe chemical nature of the waters subject to the chemical in\u0002uence of\npyrites was indeed crucial for Lister, and subsequent natural philosophers\nto comprehend meteorological and geological change. Despite the \u201cvery\nlean\u201d nature of English pyrites, Lister himself seemed to regard their\ninvestigation as particularly important. Not only did the production of\nSome metallic copper impurities in the pyrite could have reacted further with nitric\nacid to create nitrogen dioxide, a brownish gas which may have been the \u201cblack gas\u201d\nthat Hales observed:\nCu(s) + 4 H + (aq) + 2 NO3\u2013(aq) o\u0003Cu2 + (aq) + 2 NO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n147\nLister, \u201cThe Second Paper of the Same Person Concerning the Spontaneous\nFiring of the Pyrites,\u201d Philosophical Transactions, 14 (1684), pp. 515\u2013517, on p. 516.\n148\nThe Vulcano\u2019s: Or, Burning and Fire-vomiting Mountains, famous in the World . . .

This belief, informed by a reaction to Helmontian chymistry within the Royal Society, characterized the botanical work\nof Nehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712). Grew was botanist and secretary to\nthe Royal Society, has been subject to extensive scholarly analysis, ranging from the patronage required for the publication of his magisterial\nAnatomy of Plants (1682), to his cataloguing of the Royal Society collections, to his philosophy of vitalism.152 However, other than his role in\nthe discovery of Epsom salts and his promotion of nitre for fertilizer,\nhis contributions to chymistry have received less scholarly attention.\nAfter receiving his B.A. from Cambridge in 1661\u20131662, Grew went\nonto receive his medical degree from Leiden, studying under Sylvius\nand writing a dissertation on the liquors of the nervous system, utilizing\nSylvius\u2019 well-known acid-alkali iatrochymistry as the basis for his analysis.153 Grew\u2019s continued devotion to chemical research was applied to his\nbotanical work. As Bolan has shown, in his Anatomy, Grew thought it\nwas necessary to perform \u201ca chemical analysis of the contents of plants\n152\nBrian Garrett, \u201cVitalism and teleology in the natural philosophy of Nehemiah\nGrew (1641\u20131712),\u201d British Journal of the History of Science 36, 1 (March 2003), pp. 63\u201381;\nMichael Hunter, \u201cEarly Problems in Professionalizing Scienti\u0003c Research: Nethemiah\nGrew (1641\u20131712) and the Royal Society, with an unpublished Letter to Henry Oldenburg,\u201d Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 36, 2 (February 1982), pp. 189\u2013209;\nJeanne Bolam, \u201cThe Botanical Works of Nehemiah Grew, F.R.S.

The idea of preformation of salts\ncontinued to be a prevalent topic in seventeenth-century chymistry.156\nNicholas L\u00e9mery (1645\u20131715), a French corpuscularian and writer of\nthe popular French chemistry textbook, translated into English as the\nCourse of Chymistry (1698), wrote:\nSeveral modern philosophers want to persuade us that it is uncertain\nwhether the substances we obtain from the mixts and which we have\ncalled Principles of Chemistry are present effectively and naturally in the\nmixts; they say that in rarifying matter in the distillations, \u0003re is capable\nof imparting to matter subsequently an arrangement that is quite different from the one it had previously and to form the salt, oil and other\nthings obtained.157\n154\nBolam, \u201cThe Botanical Works of Nehemiah Grew, F.R.S.

Kettilby, 1698), p. 7. According\nto the Dictionary of Scienti\u0002c Biography (p. 1329), \u201cL\u00e9mery introduced his explanations of\nchemical reactions in terms of particle shape and movement on an ad hoc basis. Thus\nthe best way to explain the nature of salts is to attribute shapes to their constituent\nparticles. Acid salts must have sharp pointed particles because of their sharp taste and,\neven more convincingly, because they solidify in the form of sharp pointed crystals.\nContrariwise, alkalis are composed of earthy solid particles whose interstitial pores are\n155\n\nPages 106:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n89\nFor his part, L\u00e9mery argued that for volatile alkali salts (primarily ammonia), \u201cit is obvious that \u0003re has done something to this salt, because\nwhen it was in the plant it had not odor similar to that acquired by\nthe distillation.\u201d158\nBoyle\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Daniel Coxe, also engaged in this debate in his publications in the Royal Society Transactions, publications that apparently\nreached a wide audience. Herman Boerhaave cited Coxe\u2019s papers in\nwhich Coxe described that he took a plant, bruised and burnt it, and\nthen calcinated its ashes, extracting from it a volatile salt. He then made\na compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat; arising from\nthe ashes were salt crystals which resembled a stem, leaves and \u0002owers,\nan apparition of the plant which had been submitted to combustion.159\nCoxe also burned plants to ash, and percolated water through the ashes\nto obtain the lixivial or alkaline salts in an attempt to classify vegetative\nsalts and to illustrate a Van Helmontian principle. As these \u201calkalies\nwere also salts, questions regarding their production led directly to the\nquestion of whether or not they preexisted in combustible bodies.\u201d160\nAntonio Clericuzio has noted that Coxe denied that \u201c\u0003xed salts praeexisted in vegetables,\u201d thinking they were \u201cproduced, not extracted, by\nthe \u0003re. The salts alkali result from the combination of combination or\nunion of the saline and of the sulphureous principles.\u201d161 We not only\nsee this assertion in Coxe\u2019s published works in the Philosophical Transactions, but in a letter he wrote in 1666 to Boyle, when he states \u201cThat\nAlcalies, or \u0003xd salts made by incineration or Calcination seem not to\nhave been Such ea formac in the Concretes which afforded them by as\nso shaped as to admit entry of the spike particles of acid. L\u00e9mery postulated that, for\nreaction to take place between a particular acid and alkali, there must be an appropriate relationship between the size of the acid spikes and alkaline pores.\u201d\n158\nL\u00e9mery, Course of Chymistry, p. 20.\n159\nDaniel Coxe, \u201cA Continuation of Dr. Daniel Coxe\u2019s Discourse, Begun Numb. 107.\nTouching the Identity of All Volatile Salts\u201d Philosophical Transactions 9 (1674): 169\u2013182,\non pp. 174\u2013175.

While admitting that\nhe did get palingenic apparitions of plants via isolating salts, after\nconsulting with Royal Society fellow Robert Moray, who as we have\nseen had his own interests in salt chymistry, Coxe also argued that\nhis results were a \u201cmeer Phantasme, or a fortuitous Colation of Salt\nto such pretty \u0003gures\u201d to show that there was no saline principle that\ncould recreate the essence of a vegetable.163 Much for the same reason,\nCoxe also concluded from his researches that the \u201c\u0003xed salts extracted\nfrom the ashes of plants do not differ from one another\u201d again denying\nthere was any essential salt unique to each plant.164\nAlthough Grew followed a similar chemical procedure, he utilized\nhis botanical chymistry and microscopic expertise honed researching\nhis Anatomy of Plants to elaborate and question some of Coxe\u2019s, Boyle\u2019s,\nand hence Van Helmont\u2019s ideas about principles of matter.165 In his\nwork with plants, Grew believed \u0003rst that \u201cno principle was made\nby the \u0003re: all Principles being unalterable,\u201d and it was necessary\nto distinguish between elemental salt, or salt in its substantial form,\nwhich he did believe existed, and its \u201cmixture with other principles;\nfrom whence it may receive different Shapes and Names.\u201d166 Grew\nacknowledged that calcinations of a body, or its fermentation \u201cafter\nthe manner shewed by the curious Improver of chemical knowledge,\nDr. Daniel Cox . . . yieldeth some kind of Salt,\u201d and a \u201cLixivial Salt,\nqua Lixivial\u201d could be made by combustion.

However, he did allow for the possibility that salts created by the air were elemental salts containing the\nvital essence of a plant, and he believed he had created a process to\nextract such salts from vegetables. Grew took as his inspiration work\ndone by contemporaries that indicated volatile salts in the air, such\nas aerial nitre, possessed vitalizing and elemental principles. He also\nutilized the results of his chemical research to draw conclusions about\nplant structure and color, and like Lister, applied his results to other\nareas in natural history such as meteorology.\nSalts and Plant Structure\nGrew\u2019s extensive macroscopic and microscopic researches and the series\nof plates he drew in the Anatomy revealed to him that plants had a\nfundamental geometrical structure. In his studies, Grew concluded that\nthe \u201cleaves of most Plants, have a Regular Figure, and this Regularity,\nboth in Length and Circuit,\u201d is always de\u0003nable in terms of the arcs of\ncircles.168 At the microscopic level, leaves also had a mathematical\npattern of \u0003bres that underlay its structure, leading Grew to ask what was\nthe fundamental principle from which \u201cNature seems to draw her \u0003rst\nStrokes.\u201d169 For him, the key to the plant\u2019s regular structure lay in the\nSaline Principle \u201cunder which divers species were comprehended\u201d;\n\u201cwhether Alkaline, Acid, or of any other Kind . . . the Salts are, as it\nwere, the Bones\u201d of the plant.170 Grew\u2019s statement was likely in\u0002uenced\nby Paracelsian chemistry, as we have seen in chapter two that in the\n\u201cParacelsian scheme of the tria prima salt is the directive for matter to\nassume solidity and bodily shape.\u201d171\nGrew sought to prove this principle by \u0003rst noting that fertilizers that\nnourished plants contained salt. This suggested by analogy that plants\n167\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse Read before the Royal Society December 10, 1674 Concerning the Nature, Causes, and Power of Mixture,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants, p. 227.\n168\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 150.\n169\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 157.\n170\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\n171\nWalter Pagel, The Smiling Spleen: Paracelsianism in Storm and Stress (Basel and Munich:\nKarger, 1984), p. 37.\n\nPages 109:\n92\nchapter three\nwere also made of saline substances.172 In order to better understand\nhow salts combined to form the leaf structure, he then sought to classify\nthe types of vegetative salts. In the Producibleness of Chemical Principles\n(1681), Boyle had replaced the usual division of salts into acid and\nalkali with a tripartite division of salts into acid, alkaline, and urinous\nor volatile, (the latter category including nitre), a classi\u0003cation that Coxe\nwould also follow.173 However, Grew argued instead that vegetative\nsalts should be classi\u0003ed into four types\u2014nitrous, acid, alkaline, and\nmarine\u2014claiming \u201call the four salts have a share in the formation of\na leaf, or other part of a plant.\u201d174 Grew did acknowledge that lixiviating plants via \u0003re revealed that they contained a \u0003xed as well as a\nvolatile alkali; \u201cthe former in the ashes, the latter in the Soot\u201d; because\nplants yielded acid juices in distillation in a sand furnace, this testi\u0003ed\nto the presence of an acidic salt within them.175 But where did the\nfourth marine salt come from? Grew claimed he could produce a salt\nquite outside of the tripartite classi\u0003cation, \u201canother kind of salt . . . an\nessential salt,\u201d via the action of the air upon lixivial alkaline plant salts.\nThis essential salt would in turn, shoot another marine salt, showing\nthe air was \u201cnature\u2019s grand menstruum, which goes sometimes greater\nthan the Fire itself.\u201d176\nThough Grew does not speci\u0003cally state from where his idea of the\nair being a creative principle stemmed, it is likely his assertion may\nhave been a modi\u0003ed expression of a prevalent early modern belief in\nwitterung. Another stronger possibility is the work of William Harvey\u2019s\nstudent, Francis Glisson (1599\u20131677). Grew\u2019s microscopic work on plants\nbegan after his half-brother Henry Sampson mentioned a passage in\n172\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 275.

Robert Boyle, The Producibleness of Chymical\nPrinciples published as an appendix to The Skeptical Chymist, second edition (London,\n1681), pp. 9\u201310. As Clericuzio has indicated, Boyle was dissatis\u0003ed by the information\ngiven by using the color indicators syrup of violets or lignum nephriticum to determine\nalkalinity or acidity. This was because these tests only indicated if a salt was acid or\nnot, but one would not know if it was urinous or alkaline. Thus, \u201cBoyle suggested a\ntrail by the color non-acid salts showed when they were combined with sublimate dissolved in fair water.\u201d Lixivial salts, produced an \u201corange tawny precipitate, and urinous\nones white and milky.\u201d See Clericuzio, \u201cA rede\u0003nition,\u201d p. 588.\n174\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n175\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\n176\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse Concerning the Essential and Marine Salts of Plants, Read\nBefore the Royal Society, December 21, 1676,\u201d Anatomy of Plants, p. 261.\n173\n\nPages 110:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n93\nGlisson\u2019s Anatome Hepatis, that drew comparisons between plant and\nanimal anatomy, something which Grew developed.177 Later in the\nHepatis, Glisson also wrote that \u201cevery plant has his peculiar spirit,\u201d\nwhich were made by \u201ceminent impressions\u201d of the atmosphere; Glisson also claimed these plant spirits were physico-chemical going on to\nnote that they may \u201cbe mixed with salt or subtle sulphur.\u201d178 And of\ncourse, the long-established tradition voiced by Paracelsus about a vital\nnitrous salt in the air, subsequently modi\u0003ed by Van Helmont in his\ntheory of human breath, may have also played a role.\nIn the case of plant salts, followers of Helmont and Boyle, like\nDaniel Coxe would argue that the salts in the air would interact with\n\u0003xed salts extracted from the ashes of plants, which Coxe believed\nwere all uniform irregardless of plant species. The air would make\n\u201ccorrupted\u201d compound salts that would fool the unwary chymist into\nthinking they were different chemical species.179 This claim of Coxe\u2019s\nwas the one that Grew desired to challenge, as he believed each plant\nhad a unique essential salt.\nGrew performed chemical experiments to prove his assertions. He\ntook an alkaline lixivial solution of the salt of Fern (likely chosen as\nCoxe often utilized it), placed it an earthen pan, and exposed it to the\nair on a windowsill. He noted in nine days that amongst a cremor that\nformed on the service, an essential salt began to shoot that was ambercolored, mild-tasting, and neither sour nor sharp; this result indicated\nto Grew that it was not acidic or alkali [see Figure 4].\nThe fact that this essential salt also did not react with alkalis or acids\nmeant it was clearly not \u201ctartar or tartareous salt\u201d which \u201cmakes a\n[e]bullition with alkaline salts.\u201d180 Grew was particularly interested in\ndemonstrating this salt was not tartar (potassium bitartrate) for a few\nreasons. First, Coxe had claimed tartars were formed by the \u0003re, stating \u201cmost Vegetables, whether Woods or Herbs, if burnt whilst they\nare green, and with a smothering \u0003re, yield Salts which are far enough\nfrom Alcalisate; being either Neutral or Acid; or to speak more properly,\n177\nBolam, \u201cBotanical Works,\u201d p. 220; Garret, \u201cVitalism and teleology,\u201d p. 68.\nFrancis Glisson, Anatome Hepatis (The Anatomy of the Liver), 1654, ed.

Not only did Van Helmont demonstrate in his\nexperiment that alkali salts were made by \u0003re, but he showed that in\nan open vessel, a smaller amount of tartar was produced than in a\nclosed vessel.182 Grew however stressed that the crystals he produced\nwere \u201cno sort of Tartar, or Tartareous Salt. As is plain, from the manner\nof their Generation; Tartar being still bred in close Vessels; these never, but\nby exposing the Liquor to the Aer.\u201d183 He therefore thought the salt he\nhad discovered was a unique essential salt of the plant, \u201cdifferent in\nNature from all other Salts hitherto known, or a new Species added\nto the inventory of Nature.\u201d184\nThis essential salt of Fern was then allowed to continue to crystallize,\nand after two weeks, began to shoot another salt that in its microscopic\nshape and taste led Grew to conclude it was a \u201cmarine salt produced\nby art in the imitation of nature.\u201d185 This Marine Salt, cuboidal and\n\u201cof greater Bulk,\u201d was considered by Grew to be the foundation\nof the leaves\u2019 skeleton; here Grew alluded to the idea that the cube\namong the Platonic solids was considered the most stable, and thus\nit was appropriate to be the basis of a structure.186 The \u0003bers which\ndetermined the shape of the leaf were, as Grew\u2019s microscopic observations showed, \u201cgoverned by air vessels;\u201d the generation of these vessells\nwas \u201cdetermined by the . . . Salts according to their several Angles.\u201d187\nMarine salts produced right angles, and alkaline salts were square at\none end, and pointed at the other; placed ended to end, alkaline salts\nwould form oblique angles. Acid salts had a more crooked nature, and\nby \u201capplying the lesser Side of one to the greater Side of another,\u201d\nwould form circular or Spiral lines.188 Combinations of the various\nsalts would thus produce a variety of differently-shaped air vessels and\nshapes of leaves [Figure 5].\n181\nCoxe, \u201cA Discourse Denying the Prae-Existence of Alcalizate or Fixed Salt in\nany subject, before it were exposed to the Fire.\u201d Philosophical Transactions, 9 (1674), pp.\n150\u2013158, on p. 151.\n182\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy tried in the Fire, p. 87.\n183\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n184\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n185\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n186\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n187\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n188\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n\nPages 112:\nFigure 4.

To prove his assertion, Grew of course \u0003rst had to \u201cremove an\nOpinion standing in my way,\u201d namely the assertion that all alkaline salts\nfrom plants were the same as they were uniformly created by the \u0003re,\nas \u201csome Learned men have thought,\u201d an oblique reference to Boyle\nand Coxe.189 To allow the largest degree of impartiality possible, Grew\nhad salts prepared \u201cwith great care herein\u201d by an outside apothecary,\none John Blackstone, who stated in print that \u201call the lixivial salts\nmentioned in this and foregoing Discourse except that of Firne, were\nfaithfully prepared by me\u201d signing his name underneath his statement;\nBlackstone\u2019s more lowly social status as an apothecary would mean he\nhad to commit to a printed oath so his assertion would be accepted as\ntrue.190 Grew dissolved these lixivial alkaline salts from different plants\ninto water, and he argued that each solution had a distinctive and\nunique taste. In an earlier 1674 paper for the Philosophical Transactions\nCoxe had intimated that the different tastes for the salts were due to\nsome of the plant\u2019s oils contaminating the salts, so having Blackstone\nmake the careful preparations was important for Grew to assure saline\npurity.191 Then Grew let each solution be exposed to the air to produce\nthe different essential salts of each plant. Microscopic observation also\nillustrated that each essential salt had a unique structure and color,\narguing for their species-speci\u0003c nature [Figure 4]. Grew therefore\naccomplished what was in his eyes a truer type of plant palingenesis\nvia the medium of air rather than Coxe\u2019s use of \u0003re, and he thought\nthat he recreated the plant\u2019s essential saline structure.\n189\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 264.\nAs Steven Shapin has illustrated in A Social History of Truth, standards for epistemological truth in seventeenth-century science had their origin in gentlemen\u2019s codes of\nhonor. There was an equation between gentility, honor, and truth-telling that extended\nto empirical observation; the observations of Robert Boyle would be trusted more than\nthose by an artisan. Gentlemen, by virtue of their social status, were considered more\ncompetent sensory agents, and hence they were more likely to be leaders of opinion\nin the scienti\u0003c community.

In a paper, \u201cA Discourse\nof the Colors of Plants,\u201d read before the Royal Society in 1677,\nGrew stated that the green color of leaves was a chemical precipitate\nthat formed when the acidic salts and sulphurs that plants contained\nmixed with volatile alkali salts in the air.192 Similar chemical reactions\ncontrolled the colors of \u0002owers. Like early Paracelsian chymists, Grew\nwas attributing color to salts.\nGrew \u0003rst isolated the chemical substances within plants that he\nbelieved caused the green color of leaves. He poured sulphuric and\nnitric acid on \u201cseveral parts of vegetables,\u201d \u0003nding they made less of\na chemical reaction than acids poured on parts of animals. This led\nhim to conclude that in \u201cmost Plants, the Preadominant Principle is\nan Acid,\u201d particularly in the parenchyma, whereas animal substances\ncontained more alkalis.193 Grew also argued that plants contained\nsulphur, especially in the wood, as there was a large amount of resinous sap in the wood\u2019s lympheducts, the sap having the same oily and\n\u0002ammable properties of sulphureous substances. He then performed a\nseries of experiments in which he dropped the alkali spirit of hartshorn\n(aqueous solution of ammonia) or sal ammoniac on tinctures of \u0002owers and on leaves. Spirit of Hartshorn on tinctures of borage \u0002ower\nturned them \u201cverdigreese Green,\u201d and when it was dropped on green\nleaves, the color did not change at all, leading him to postulate that\nthere was some alkaline \u201cor like salt in the Air, which is predominant\nin the production of Green in the Leavs of Plants.\u201d194 According to\nhis reasoning, roots of most plants were white because they were not\nexposed to the volatile alkaline salts in the air, noting that the upper\nparts of roots, \u201cwhen they happen to stand naked about the Ground,\u201d\nwere colored by the air, such as in red sorrel roots or purple radish\ntops.195 Transverse cuts of plant stalks showed a white bark parenchyma,\n192\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse of the Colors of Plants,\u201d Anatomy of Plants, p. 271.\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort of the Luctation Arising from the Affusion of\nSeveral Menstruums upon all Sorts of Bodies, Exhibited to the Royal Society, April\n13, and June 1, 1676,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants, p. 240.\n194\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n195\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 270.\n193\n\nPages 115:\n98\nchapter three\nbut sap vessels which admitted the aerial volatile salts were as \u201cgreen as\nthe skin itself because they stand close to the Aer-Vessels.\u201d196 Flowers\nin bud also tended to be whitish until exposed to the alkaline salts in\nthe air.\nThe colors of \u0002owers were produced by differing combinations of\nvolatile alkaline salts and substances within the plant. Grew tested\nputting spirit of sulphur (sulphuric acid) on plant leaves, \u0003nding that\ndropped on green leaves, it turned the leaves yellow, but had no effect\nwhen dropped on yellow \u0002owers. He concluded therefore that \u201cin\nall yellow [\u0002owers] the sulphureous acids and the alkaline parts are\nall more equal.\u201d197 Spirit of Sulphur dropped into tincture of violets\nturned this Ph indicator from blue to crimson, and likewise when spirit\nof sulphur was dropped onto a tincture of clove-july \u0002owers it made\nthem bright blood red, and also heightened the red of roses. Thus, as\n\u201calkalis are predominant in Greens,\u201d acids dominated in red \u0002owering\nplants.198 From these and other chemical experiments, Grew formulated\nthe following rules:\n1. When sulphur and aerial saline principles \u201conly swam together\u201d but\nwere not united chemically, no color was produced, as was the case\nin roots.\n2. When sulphur and alkaline salts were united, they produced green\ncolors.\n3. When sulphur, alkaline, and acid salts were in equal proportions and\nreacting with each other, a yellow \u0002ower was produced.\n4. When the sulphur predominated, and the acid and alkaline were\nequal, there \u201cwas a blew.\u201d\n5. If the sulphur was most predominant to the \u201calkaline and acid,\u201d\n\u0002owers were scarlet.\n6. Variegated colors were the \u201cover proportion of the Lympheducts to\nthe Aer-Vessels,\u201d [in different parts of the \u0002ower and leaves], and\ntherefore the dominion of the Sulphure over the Air therein.\u201d199\nGrew postulated that yellow and green \u0002owers and leaves suffered less\nloss of color when dried because the volatile salts in \u201cthe Aer being\n196\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 270.\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n198\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n199\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.

For example, in 1674, John\nMayow (1640\u20131679) in his Tractatus Quinque Medico-Physici, claimed that\nair was composed of a \u201csmall proportion of highly reactive particles\nwhich he identi\u0003ed as a nitro-aerial spirit\u201d; like oxygen, \u201cthese particles\nalone made air suitable for respiration, and when absorbed through the\nlungs they imparted the bright red color to arterial blood.\u201d201 As we\nhave seen in the work of Lister, many early modern natural philosophers thought that respiration and anatomy in plants and animals was\ndirectly analogous. Marcello Malphigi (1628\u20131694), who submitted his\nown manuscript on plant anatomy to the Royal Society approximately\nat the same time as it had agreed to publish Grew\u2019s work The Anatomy\nof Vegetables (1671), asserted that the venation of leaves was analogous\nto the system of capillaries in animals.202 Because the pith of plant\nstems was enclosed, Malphigi also compared it with the heart and brain\nof animals, and wood with animal bones and teeth.203 Grew himself\nthought the root was similar to mouth into which entered a solution\nof nutrients and water, as well as air.204 However, Grew also realized\nthat animal circulation of the blood required valves, whereas no such\nvalves could be found when he traced the movement of plant sap.205\nThus, despite the arguments of his peers that circulation in plants and\nanimals, and thus chemical reactions in blood and sap were directly\n200\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.\nHenry Guerlac, \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Nitre,\u201d Isis 45, 3 (September 1954): pp. 243\u2013255,\non p. 243.\n202\nAgnes Arber, \u201cNehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694):\nAn Essay in Comparison,\u201d Isis, 34, 1 (Summer 1942), pp. 7\u201316, on p. 13.\n203\nArber, \u201cNehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694): An\nEssay in Comparison,\u201d p. 13.\n204\nC.A.

Tulips\u201d were made this way; in Holland in the\n1630s, \u201ctulip fever\u201d arose for striped or variegated blooms in which\nscandalous sums were paid for a prized bulb, making this topic one\nof timely concern for the Royal Society\u2019s efforts.207 Changing the soil,\nor transplanting seeds from one bed to another would also lead the\nplant to be \u201csuperimpregnated with several Tinctures.\u201d208 Lastly, mixing\nsoil with differing salts that \u201cwould concur with the Aer, to strike or\nprecipitate their Sulphur into so many several colors,\u201d would \u201cbring\neven Natures Art of Painting, in a great part, into our own power.\u201d209\nEarly chymistry had \u201clong preserved the very recipes for pigments\nthat were the daily bread of those who composed their own painting\nmedia\u201d; Grew\u2019s methods were another means for the chemist to be an\nartist of nature.210\nAlong with color, Grew believed the tastes of plants were also based\nupon saline chymistry, and could also be manipulated. Grew \u0003rst postulated that plants that had a pungent taste did so because after the\nsaliva dissolved their juices, their biting or nitrous salts remained on the\ntongue.211 He hence concluded that Arum, which had a bitter nitrous\ntaste, would thus grow best under a hedge, as the ground was not\n206\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 278. For the tulip craze, see Mike Dash, Tulipomania: The Story of the World\u2019s Most Coveted Flower &amp; the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused.\n(New York: Three Rivers Press, 1999). The reason for the striping is the tulip bulb\nbecomes infected with Mosaic Virus; the striping is thus not hereditary, leading to the\ncrash in prices for these bulbs in the 1630s. The Dutch government declared it would\nnot honor tulip contracts created before 1636, considering them gambling debts.\n208\nGrew\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 98 to page 117 out of a total of 312.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 98 to 117, which focus on the work of several figures and the role of salts in natural history, specifically regarding plants and weather phenomena:

1. <strong>Martin Lister (1639–1712)</strong> studied plant respiration, proposing that plant breath influenced natural occurrences like wind and rain. He linked the exhalations of pyrites (a sulphuric mineral) to thunderstorms and earthquakes, supported by experiments and historical texts, including *Natural History* by Pliny [*De Fontibus*, 1684, pp. 98–99](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=98).

2. <strong>Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712)</strong>, a key figure in botanical chymistry, researched plant structure and the role of salts in determining plant color and growth. He argued that salts acted like &quot;the bones&quot; of plants and that different types of salts (alkaline, acidic, marine, nitrous) were responsible for variations in plant morphology [*The Anatomy of Plants*, 1682, pp. 105–106](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=105).

3. <strong>Plant Color and Chemistry</strong>: Grew connected plant coloration to the presence of various salts. He suggested that different chemical reactions between plant salts and air produced colors, with green being linked to alkaline salts and red to acidic salts. He performed several experiments to show how salts influenced plant colors, including manipulating the color of flowers through exposure to salts in the air [pp. 113–115](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=113).

In the mornings, I went to lectures, visited the Uf\u0002zi, or the Bargello to marvel at\nDuccio\u2019s zigzagged cruci\u0002xions, the Christ\u2019s almond-shaped eyes closed\nin furrowed pain. I sketched and made notes. In the hot afternoons,\nI wandered around the city when everyone took their reposo or siesta.\nStrolling past the cheese shops that smelled of the \u201cfeet of the gods,\u201d\ninto the artisans\u2019 quarter where the paper of tempting marbleized\njournals sparkled with painted copper tips adorning scrolls, \u0003owers\nand foliage, I ambled past the Orsanmichele. Here Donatello\u2019s statues,\nsuspended in time, instructed passers-by about civil duty, Florentine\npride, and moral rectitude. But walking up to the San Miniato del\nMonte, a solid church with thick brick walls decorated with frescoes on\nthe inside and geometric marble mosaics on the outside, was a special\nexcursion. It was on as much of a mountain as one would \u0002nd outside\nof Florence, affording a view of Brunelleschi\u2019s dome and the red-tiled\nroofs of the city below.\nOne July day, after an ample lunch of pasta, olives, and salty tomato\nsauce to maintain my perpetually hungry adolescent metabolism, I\nwalked to San Minato, looking forward to the cool sanctuary and\nsalubrious perfume of the rose garden. Perspiring heavily in the hot\nTuscan sun as I ascended the hill, I began to feel odd. White dots\nappeared before my eyes, my stomach felt heavy, and the bright colors\nof the landscape turned faint and grey. I stumbled to a wall to rest,\nand I subsequently awoke to an elderly and ample Italian lady clad in\nblack wafting a bottle that smelled piercing and sharp under my nose.\n\u201cSal volatile, sal volatile,\u201d she kept repeating, and then \u201cbene, bene\u201d\nas my eyes \u0003uttered open. I was befuddled, yet gradually aware I had\nfainted, my shirt ripped and a long scrape down my side indicating\nmy fall against the wall. The awareness of pain from the scrape and\nthe contents of the bottle rapidly propelled me to consciousness. \u201cSal\nvolatile? Sal volatile? what is that?\u201d I thought. Then I realized, \u201cVolatile\nsalts . . . oh, smelling salts! Grazie, grazie, signora.\u201d\n\nPages 19:\n2\nchapter one\nAfter returning to my pensione, I thought about the restorative I had\nbeen offered. Smelling salts were something I had previously thought\nonly existed in Victorian novels, but then I also thought only tightly\ncorseted heroines were capable of fainting, not an American student\nwho was suffering from dehydration and heat stroke. From that day,\nI wondered what the source of the idea was that salts contained a\nvital principle that would restore consciousness. That thought led to\nthe writing of this book, which delineates the important cultural and\nscienti\u0002c origins and effects of salt chymistry in early modern England,\nand among other purposes, demonstrates the source of the idea of salt\nas a source of life and restoration.\nIn this work, I will\n1. Demonstrate the centrality of salt and salt chymistry to early\nchymistry and matter theory generally, and ask to what extent natural\nphilosophers and physicians in the seventeenth and eighteenth century\nconsidered salt fundamental to science and medicine.1 The term \u201csalt\u201d\nin the early modern period was a vague one, but usually encompassed a\ngroup of \u201csolid soluble, in\u0003ammable substances with characteristic tastes\u201d2\nand a crystalline structure. In the early modern period, as the historian\nNorma Emerton has commented \u201cas the instrument of the form, as\nembodiment of the generative seed and spirit, and as the transmitter\nof mineral qualities including crystallinity, salt became the formative\nprinciple par excellence.\u201d3 Some chymists, such as Joseph Duchesne\n(1544\u20131609), Johann Glauber (1604\u201370), and Nicaise La Febvre (1610 \u2013\n1669) claimed there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d or formative salt believed\nto be responsible for minerallogenesis and the formation of matter, or\nperhaps a source of the alkahest or universal dissolvent.4 I will delineate\n1\nMy use of the term chymical and chymistry throughout this book is quite deliberate,\nas it is anachronistic practice to make clear distinctions between alchemy and chemistry\nin the seventeenth century. Early modern \u201cchymists\u201d attempted to transmute metals\ninto gold, considered an alchemical practice, yet also performed other experiments\ninvolving mass balance or crystallographic analysis that would be considered \u201cchemical.\u201d For further analysis of this historiographic problem, see L.M.

Assert that salt chymistry provides a nexus for studying the interrelationships between chymistry, natural history, physiology, and medical\nsciences in the early modern period. My exploration of natural history\u2019s\nintersection with chemical investigation in early modern England, particularly amongst early Royal Society members, proved a ripe area to\nexplore the growing importance of the senses and experience as causes\nof intellectual change in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While\nthe concept of the Paracelsian tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury is\nimportant to consider in tracing the source of these ideas, I argue the\nwork of the physician Johann Van Helmont was at their base.\n3. Argue that analyzing to what extent the alchemical understanding of salts was modi\u0002ed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nis crucial to our understanding of the transition between alchemy and\nchymistry. To accomplish this task, I will determine to what extent conceptions of volatile salts were modi\u0002ed by a diminishing of interest in\nthe salt principle, and increasing emphasis upon acidic saline spirits as\nthe fundamental movers in chymistry, natural processes and medicine\nin the \u0002rst half of the eighteenth century. As Ecklund commented,\n\u201cin the eighteenth century salts gradually became to be thought of in\nterms of process, as, for example, the product of the reaction between\nacids and bases, acids and other salts, or between two salts, etc. Some\nchemists regarded acids . . . themselves as salts or at least some saline\nsubstances.\u201d5 Indeed, Chambers Cyclopaedia (1728) de\u0002ned salt as a\n\u201csimple acid substance.\u201d6 In the early eighteenth century, the formative\nqualities of volatile salts were also thought to be an aid to longevity.\nBefore oxygen was \u201cdiscovered,\u201d acidic saline spirits were perceived to\nbe the source of life\u2019s breath, revealing not only the origins of the idea\nof smelling salts, but early theories of respiratory physiology.\nhealth . . .

In contrast, in England, chapter three of this book\nwill show that chymistry was rather more intimately connected to the\n\u201cvirtuosic dabblings,\u201d of the more loosely-organized Royal Society,\nlargely in natural history. Salt was seen by natural philosophers such as\nMartin Lister (1638\u20131711), Robert Moray (1609\u201373), Thomas Philipot\n(d. 1682), Nehemiah Grew (d. 1682), and Robert Boyle (1627\u201391) to be a\nprimeval principle or fundamental mover in processes usually described\nin natural history accounts, such as tides, volcanoes, meteorological\neffects, and plant respiration.\nThe effects of volatile salts (in early modern chymistry, those that\nhave an odor and were reactive to heat), particularly of vitriol (ferrous\nsulphate) and saltpeter (potassium nitrate also known as nitre) were at\nthe center of these studies in natural history.13 This may have been\nbecause the crystals of the salts of vitriol are large and prominent,\nand because sulphuric and nitric acids produced spectacular and often\n10\nFrederic L.

To indicate the pervasiveness of these\nbeliefs, appendix one provides a translation of Martin Lister\u2019s work\nDe Fontibus medicatis Angliae Exercitatio (1684) [Exercises on the healing\nsprings of England], which contains an extensive discussion of vitriol\nand early beliefs about volatile salts.\nFurther, as Dear has noted, the early Royal Society\u2019s \u201cstyle of presentation\u201d of natural philosophy with its wealth of circumstantial evidence\nand empirical detail \u201callowed no clear distinction to be made between\na \u2018natural historical\u2019 . . . and an \u2018experimental report.\u2019 \u201d14 True to this\nfashion, English experimental works of salt chymistry in the seventeenth\ncentury, not only in form, but in their content, were \u201cnatural historical.\u201d\nDetailed reports of the phenomena of natural history were accompanied\nby theories of salt chymistry as underlying explanations for observed\nevents. Ursula Klein\u2019s work has analyzed to what extent the chemical\nexperiments in Herman Boerhaave\u2019s (1668\u20131738) Elementae Chemiae\nrelated not only to experimental philosophy, but to experimental history\nand natural history.15 In a similar manner, an exploration of natural\nhistory\u2019s intersection with chemical investigation in early modern England is a ripe area to explore the growing importance of the senses\nand experience as causes of intellectual change in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries.\nThe salt principle was also a fundamental alchemical tenet, and in\nchapter four I analyze to what extent the alchemical understanding of\nsalts was modi\u0002ed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to contribute to our comprehension of the early modern transition between\nalchemy and chymistry. As Principe has noted,\nin the Paracelsian triad [of salt, sulphur, and mercury] the largely analogical, relative, and \u0003uid categories of the Mercury and Sulphur of\nthe dyad are made more rigid so that the tria prima becomes universal,\nconstant, primary, elemental bodies. For example, Quercetanus, one of\nthe most important early expositors of the Paracelsian tria prima, insists\nin his liber de priscorum philosophorum varae medicinae materia that Mercury,\n14\nPeter Dear, \u201cTotius en Verba: Rhetoric and Authority in the Early Royal Society,\u201d\nIsis 76, 2 ( June 1985), pp. 144\u201361, on p. 154.\n15\nUrsula Klein, \u201cExperimental history and Herman Boerhaave\u2019s chemistry of\nplants,\u201d Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 34, (2003), pp.\n533\u2013567.

Spery (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1996).\n\nPages 24:\nthe context of salts\n7\nSulphur, and Salt are present in all bodies, and that the scope of chymical philosophy includes not only minerals and metals, but also plants and\nanimals, weather, and even celestial bodies.16\nSeventeenth-century writers, particular those of chemical textbooks, as\nwell as the iatrochymists, chemical physicians, and apothecaries who\nfollowed Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) also recognized the expansion of the\ntria prima\u2019s principles to include all bodies.\nHowever, Principe also argues that Paracelsus was not the chief of\nthe alchemists, and did not inform \u201call of alchemy or even a major\npart of it,\u201d and that understanding diverse schools of thought among\nearly modern alchemists is important.17 His point is well taken in the\ncase of theories of salt chymistry and natural history, which I also show\nin chapter three were more dominated by the thought of physician\nJohannes Baptista Van Helmont (1579\u20131644) rather than the theories of\nParacelsus. Van Helmont believed that volatile salts composed the vital\nspirit or the breath of both animals and plants which was \u201cresolved in\nthe heart by fermentation into a salt air and enlightened by life.\u201d18 In\nother words, volatile salts were thought to compose a vital spirit made\nof arterial blood transformed in the heart by fermentation into a salt\nair that was expelled by breathing.19 Just as van Helmont thought that\nheated blood discharged its volatile salts into the air, Robert Boyle\nand his colleague Daniel Coxe (1640\u20131730) believed that volatile salts\n\u201cbeing received into the vast subtile \u0003uid [atmosphere] . . . becomes the\nInstrument of sundry remarkable effects and operations, not only in\nNatural, but also [in] Arti\u0002cial productions.\u201d20\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, interest in the salt principle\nbegan to decline. Belief in the salt principle diminished, \u201cas did interest\nin elements in general, in favor of a notion of a primeval or universal\nacid as a fundamental mover in natural processes, usually equated with\n16\nLawrence M.

I also will analyze the writings of Newtonian physicians such as\nBryan Robinson (1680\u20131754), Archibald Pitcairne (1652\u20131713), George\nCheyne (1671\u20131743) and Richard Mead (1673\u20131754) who posited a\n\u201cNewtonian physiology\u201d based on the premises in the Principia, as well\nas queries in Newton\u2019s Opticks and the De Natura Acidorum. Although\nAnita Guerrini pioneered the studies of \u201cNewton-struck\u201d physicians\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century, her emphasis\nwas primarily in the application of Newtonian physics to medicine;\nI will concentrate upon Newton\u2019s chymical works and their in\u0003uence\nin the medical community.23 Chapter \u0002ve will examine the spread of\nthese medical concepts of salt chymistry in larger society, looking at\ntheir role in patent medicines, in satire, and in medical treatments to\npromote longevity.\nBy the eighteenth century, we will see that suggestions for the identity of this universal acid re\u0003ected the \u201cnovel preoccupations . . . of the\nphlogiston theory, the nature of combustion, pneumatic chymistry, and\nrespiration;\u201d Lavoisier, for example, \u201cfastened upon the elementary\ngas, which he named oxygen (literally acid generator) as his acidifying\nprinciple.\u201d24 In the concluding chapter, I will brie\u0003y demonstrate this\n21\nMulthauf, Neptune\u2019s Gift, p. 130.\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 184.\n23\nAnita Guerrini, \u201cThe Tory Newtonians: Gregory, Pitcairne, and their Circle,\u201d\nJournal of British Studies, 25 (1986), pp. 288\u2013311; Anita Guerrini, \u201cArchibald Pitcairne\nand Newtonian Medicine,\u201d Medical History, 31 (1987), pp. 70\u201383; Anita Guerrini,\nObesity and Depression in the Enlightenment: The Life and Times of George Cheyne (Norman:\nUniversity of Oklahoma Press, 2000).\n24\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 227.\n22\n\nPages 26:\nthe context of salts\n9\ntheoretical progression, my analysis of this progression used to elucidate the staggered and incomplete development of chymistry from\nalchemical beliefs, one of the key historiographic issues in the study of\nearly modern chymistry.25 Finally I hope that I will have answered my\nquestion, formulated a long time ago in Tuscany, about why salt was\nthought to be a vital element.\n25\nNewman and Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. chymistry: The etymological origins of a\nhistoriographic mistake,\u201d passim.\n\nPages 27:\nCHAPTER TWO\nPARACELSIAN CONCEPTS OF SALTS\nAristotelian analyses of the elements in his On the Heavens and Of\nMeteorology dominated conceptions of matter in late medieval natural\nphilosophy. The heavens above the moon were created of the ether, a\nperfect shining element whose natural motion was circular and perfect.\nBelow the moon, there were the corruptible earth, air, \u0002re and water\nelements composing the material world. Each element was classi\u0002ed as\neither being hot or cold, and wet or dry. The heavy earth element had a\nnatural motion downwards towards the center of the earth, as Aristotle\npostulated elements teleologically strove to be in their natural place with\ntheir identical components of matter. Water also went down towards\nthe oceans, just as rain fell down out of the sky. Fire strove upwards to\nbe towards the ring of \u0002re thought to be surrounding the earth above\nits atmosphere; the upward motion of a burning candle illustrated this\nprinciple. Elemental air also went up towards the atmosphere. Each of\nthese elements was paired with its opposite element which had a natural\nmotion in a direction contrary to its own. Water, which was heavy and\nwet, was paired with \u0002re, which was light and dry; the heavy and dry\nearth found its opposite in the light and wet air.\nThe sun was also responsible for the generative properties of the four\nelements, aiding them by its heat and light to mix and create minerals,\nplant and animal life. Aristotle postulated in his geocentric astronomical\nsystem that the sun was not in the center of the universe, but rather\nin the midst of all the other planets. The sun could radiate light in all\ndirections, essential because Aristotle believed that the generation and\ncorruption, or becoming and passing-away, of all sublunar creatures\nand elements was dependent on the Sun.1 Robert Grosseteste, the late\nmedieval scholar and Bishop of Lincoln, expressed a common opinion when he stated that if the Sun were elevated to the region of the\n1\nAristotle, \u201cOn Generation and Corruption,\u201d in The Complete Works of Aristotle. 2\nvols. ed Jonathan Barnes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 2.10.336b, lines\n16\u201324; quoted in Edward Grant, Planets, Stars, and Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200 \u20131687\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 453.\n\nPages 28:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n11\nprimum mobile, the elements and compounds around the earth would\nbe destroyed because the earth\u2019s heat would be reduced.2 If the Sun\ndescended to the region of the Moon, its proximity to the elements of\nearth, water, air, and \u0002re would also destroy them. As it was, when near\nthe earth, the sun caused the waters surrounding the earth to evaporate,\nbut when it receded those waters condensed and fell.\nAs has been well documented by Debus and Pagel, Auroleus Phillipus\nTheostratus Bombastus von Hohenheim or Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) challenged these Aristotelian conceptions of the elements in the sixteenth\ncentury. Hellenistic alchemical texts posited that mercury and sulphur\nwere the basic elemental principles, and Paracelsus added salt to this,\ncreating the tria prima or three principles.3 While Paracelsus had no\ndesire to dispose of the Aristotelian schema of earth, air, water, and\n\u0002re, he did feel that they were purely \u201cspiritual in nature and only crude\napproximations of the objects by which we call these names.\u201d4 And,\nwhen Paracelsus added the tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury, this\nsecond elementary system of matter, he failed to\nmake clear the relationship of the new triad to the traditional elements.\nVarying between spiritual and material interpretations, the elements and\nprinciples were often pictured as often inde\u0002nable aspects of a primal stuff\nthat had to exist as a basis for the more complex things of this world.5\nThis state of affairs meant that sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nEnglish chymists integrated the Aristotelian and Paracelsian schemas\nas they saw necessary, coming up with different numbers of elements\nand principles to suit their needs. This chapter will explore how coexistence of elements and principles in\u0003uenced conceptions of the salt\nprinciple among Paracelsian chymists in England in the \u0002rst half of\nthe seventeenth century.\nIn this contextual chapter for our study of early modern saline chymistry, not only will we explore to what extent the material conception\n2\nRobert Grosseteste, Hexa\u00ebmeron, ed.

We will then also compare\nDuchesne\u2019s ideas about the medical use of salts to those of Turquet de\nMayerne, a French Paracelsian, who bound up in the antimony wars\nin France, emigrated to become a physician to Charles I of England.\nFinally, we will analyze the role of salt in the work of Johann Glauber\n(1604\u201370), the German chymist whose ideas were in\u0003uential in the\nintellectual circle in England centered about scienti\u0002c reformer Samuel\nHartlib (1600\u20131662) in the 1640s until the Restoration.6\nJoseph Duchesne and Thomas Tymme\u2019s\nPractice of Chymicall Physick\nJoseph Duchesne (1544\u20131609, known as Quercetanus) was a French\ncourt physician to Henry IV, and was considered \u201cas one of the leading\nauthorities on the new chemical medicines in Europe.\u201d7 Renowned and\nrebuffed for his chymical remedies, Duchesne was involved in public\ncontroversy within and without the French court, including successfully\ndefending Louise Robot, the Mademoiselle de Martinville, and her\nmother-in-law involving charges of incest.8 Duchesne\u2019s notoriety as well\nas his chymical theories caused English minister Thomas Tymme to\ntranslate his Libert de Priscorum Philosophorum verae medicinae material (1603)\nand the Ad Veritatem Hermeticae Medicinae ex Hippocratis vertumque decretis ac\nTherapeusi (1604) to create the Practice of Chymicall and Hermeticall Physick\n6\nJ.T.

In doing so, Tymme produced the \u0002rst treatise in England that\nwas devoted to Paracelsian theory since Richard Bostocke\u2019s Paracelsian\napology, the Difference between the auncient Phisicke . . . and the latter Phisicke\n(1585).9 The Practice was not only one of the \u0002rst seventeenth-century\ntreatises in English to have a complete explanation of Aristotelian and\nParacelsian elements, but it was the \u0002rst to have an extended discussion\nof the Paracelsian salt principle. Duchesne\u2019s work also was popularized\nin the \u0002rst half of the seventeenth century, in\u0003uencing more practical\nworks of Paracelsian medicine and chymistry such as John Woodall\u2019s\nSurgeon\u2019s Mate (1617).\nConsidering the muddied state of affairs created by the overlay of the\ntria prima unto the Aristotelian elemental system, it is not surprising that\nDuchesne created his own theoretical system, using a matrix of \u0002ve\nprinciples with both Paracelsian and Aristotelian elements.10 In Le Grand\nmiroir de Monde (1584) and the Defensio (1605), Duchesne had eliminated\nair as an element as he believed it was rari\u0002ed water, and disregarded\n\u0002re as well because it was not mentioned in Genesis, leaving earth,\nwater, salt, sulphur and mercury as his \u0002ve principles.11 To confuse\nthe issue further, Tymme in his translation modi\u0002ed Duchesne\u2019s ideas,\ninstead emphasizing a Trinitarian correspondence between the \u201cpassive\u201d\nAristotelian elements of earth, \u0002re, and water (which included terrestrial water and the upper waters of air), with the chymically \u201cactive\u201d\nParacelsian elements of salt, sulphur, and mercury. Debus is correct to\nsurmise that Tymme\u2019s emphasis on the trinity of matter was because\nof his vocation as a minister\u2014he attributed mystical properties to the\ntrinities of chemistry and religion.\nHowever, despite Tymme\u2019s Trinitarian thrust, one which will extend to\nthe classi\u0002cation of saline substances themselves, it cannot be overlooked\nthat salt emerges as an overwhelmingly predominant principle in his\ntranslation. Part one of the Practice is devoted to \u201cchymicall\u201d physick, and\ncontains three chapters about the material nature of salts. The entire\nsecond part and most of the third concerns the \u201chermeticall\u201d or spiritual\nnature of the \u201chermaphroditical\u201d salt, an \u201cideal Platonic form of salt.\u201d\nChemists like Duchesne, as well as Johann Glauber (1604\u201370), and Nicaise\nLa Febvre (1610\u20131669) claimed that there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d\n9\nAllen G.

There were several contenders for the identity of this formative salt principle including nitre,\nantinomy, and vitriol, the debates about which we shall analyze.\nPart one of the Practice:\nSalts, material substance, and the secondary qualities of taste and color\nPart one of the Practice devoted to chymical analysis began by describing the material nature of salt. It was seen as a \u201cdry body, merely\nearthy . . . endowed with wonderfull virtues of dissolving, congealing,\ncleansing,\u201d and as the substantive body in the trinity of spirit (mercury)\nand soul (sulphur); this concept was taken from Duchesne\u2019s Ad veritatem.12\nAnd, Tymme\u2019s classi\u0002cation was in keeping with the Paracelsian tria\nprima, in which \u201csalt is the directive for matter to assume solidity and\nbodily shape.\u201d13 Continuing the tripartite theme, all salts were believed\nto contain within themselves salty, sulphureous, and mercurial qualities\n\u201cjointly together.\u201d Common earthy salt, \u201c\u0002xed and \u0002rme,\u201d nitrous salt,\n\u201cpartly \u0002xed and partly volatile,\u201d participating in the \u201csulphureous\nbeginnings of things,\u201d and sal ammoniac, which was \u201cof the Mercuriall\nbeginning spiritual and airie\u201d could all be extracted from any saline\nsubstance by a \u201cwittie\u201d saltmaker with the \u201cforce of \u0002re.\u201d14\nTymme also claimed that salts also were responsible for secondary\nqualities of matter, such as color or taste. It was also possible to discern\nwhich type of salt in a sample was predominant, whether sulphureous,\n\u0002xed, or mercurious, by taste. Earthy \u0002xed salt had a simple salt taste,\nnitrous or sulphureous salt a sweet and oily one, and mercurial salt was\nsour. In fact, a substance without any salt, such as water, was described\nby Tymme as \u201cutterly unsavory.\u201d15 This belief that water was tasteless\nwas ultimately derived from Aristotle\u2019s On Sense and the Sensible,16 in which\n12\nJoseph Duchesne, (1605) The practice of chymicall and hermeticall physicke, trans.

These predominant salt, sweet, or sour\ntastes which derived from salty, sulphureous, or mercurial salts in any\nsubstance, the Practice argued, are attenuated by mixture with the \u201cpassive\u201d Aristotelian qualities of earth, \u0002re, and water.17 Tymme wrote:\nfor the sharpe is mixed with a mercurial liquor; the sower is mixed with a\nphlegmatique, or watery humour, and the eger, with a terrestrial driness:\nthe which, the more they have of the Elementary qualities, and the same\npassive, so much the more weake they are and impaired.18\nHowever, by chymical art, the active salts could be separated from\nthe passive elements, and \u201cobtaine their full force,\u201d for medicinal\npurposes.19\nIn a simpler vein, \u201ccookery\u201d could also be used to change tastes of\nsubstances, as heat would volatilize the differing salts in the food. For\ninstance,\nSo if thou shalt drawe out of onions and garlicke a Volatile and aiery\nsharpe Mercurial Salt, which ariseth in the super\u0002cies &amp; uppermost of\ntheir bodies: thou shalt make them more sweet and pleasing, and to put\noff their sharpenesse, by which they bite the tongue.20\nIn other words, the sweetness of the cooked onions and garlic was\nbecause the marine salt and sulphureous salt were left behind after\nheating, lending their qualities of taste to the cooked food.\nThis premise that taste arises from a proportion of salts mixed with\npassive elements was a Paracelsian challenge to the Aristotelian-scholastic,\nand hence Galenic idea that taste was due to the hot, cold, moist, and\ndry qualities of the substance in question. Aristotle believed heat and\ncold were among the most fundamental features of matter in the secondary realm, including that of taste, digestive savor in the mouth, and\nnutritional value. In the On Sense and the Sensible, taste and savor increased\nin direct proportion with heat, whereas \u201ccoldness and freezing render\nSavors dull, and abolish odours altogether; for cooling and freezing\ntend to annul the kinetic heat which helps to fabricate sapidity.\u201d In the\nAristotelian scheme, moistness also increased strength of taste. But for\nTymme and Duchesne, the proportion of salts was behind the sensory\nappreciation of food.\n17\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

D4 verso.\n18\n\nPages 33:\n16\nchapter two\nAnother challenge to scholastic assumptions was the Practice\u2019s argument that saline spirits were behind the diversity of color in mineral,\nvegetable and animal matter, a belief we shall see in chapter three that\n\u0002fty years later will in\u0003uence theories in the Royal Society about plant\npigments. Scholastics believed that color was related to the material\u2019s\nhot and cold qualities. This stemmed from Aristotle\u2019s belief that hotness and coldness were among the most fundamental characteristics of\nmatter in the sublunary area, something later mechanists would deny.21\nAristotle also promoted a causal thesis of perception, or that \u201cthe\ncapacity of a sensible quality to produce perception has as its basis the\nintrinsic nature of the quality;\u201d when applied to color, this meant that\nthe inherent quality of a red object makes us perceive it as red.22 And,\nthe object\u2019s inherent quality of redness also meant the object had an\ninherent quality of hotness as well. Whiteness usually meant the object\nalso had an inherent quality of coldness, like snow. Thus, as Tymme\nnoted, the scholastic\nPhysitians . . . have . . . noted certain frivolous and light observations: as\nwhen they say, that in a white onion, or in white wine, a man may judge\nby the color a great coldnesse, than in a red onion or in red wine.23\nIn contrast, Paracelsians argued that \u201csolidity and often color were due\nto salt.\u201d24 Tymme noted that arsenic, which is a white sublimate, and\nthus should be cold, instead was very biting to the taste (a hot quality).\nFurther, white sugar when heated, revealed \u201cits innermost spirits,\u201d and\nbecame sharp in taste, its \u201cwaters\u201d dissolving metal, also symptomatic\nof hot qualities. This refutation of Aristotelian principles meant that\ncolor proceeded from \u201cthe spirits . . . or aery vapours, which lye hid in\nthe Salt,\u201d and was not related to heat or cold at all.25 As an example\nof this, Tymme utilized Saltpeter or Nitre. Nitre was also white, but\nwhen heated, dyed the body of the alembic colors \u201cof no less variety,\nthen are \u0003owers of the earth in the time of the Spring.\u201d26\n21\nTodd Stuart Ganson, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong with the Aristotelian Theory of Sensible\nQualities,\u201d Phronesis XLII, 3, (1997), pp. 263\u2013282, on p. 264.\n22\nGanson, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong,\u201d p. 276.\n23\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

E1 verso.\n\nPages 34:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n17\nJust as salts were behind colors and tastes of substances, Tymme\nargued in the Practice that the very substance of matter could be reduced\nto salts, and he utilized experiments with wine and its vinegar to do\nso. It was \u0002rst postulated that salts could be volatilized by exposing\nthe substances in which they were contained to \u201ccelestial in\u0003uences,\u201d\nsuch as sunlight. Via an elaborate system of astral parallels, Paracelsus\nhad taught that celestial in\u0003uences at the macrocosmic level in\u0003uenced\nthe microcosm of the body, as well as causing chemical change in the\ninanimate world. Taking Paracelsus\u2019 idea in consideration, Tymme\nwrote that the celestial in\u0003uence of the sun could reveal hidden salts\nthat made up matter, as in the case of wine exposed to sunlight turning\nto vinegar. He claimed that sun \u201cvaporeth\u201d away the wine\u2019s quintessence, and\nthis eternal and celestial essence being gone, which was the cause of the\nwines sweetnes (which sweetnes hath alwaeies joined with it neverthelesse,\na certain pricking very acceptable to the palate, by reason of a singular\ntemper of sharpnesse Vitriolated by sweete and Sulphurus spirits, put by\nthe instinct of nature into wine) at the length it waxeth sower.27\nThe sourness and sharpness of vinegar had nothing to do with its\nsupposed cold qualities, but to the \u201chidden . . . spirits of Salt,\u201d whose\nsourness was revealed when sulphureous salts were volatilized away\nby sunlight.\nTymme would further test the saline constitution of vinegar using\ndistillation. Distilling three pints of vinegar revealed \u0002rst watery phlegm\nwithout taste. After this phlegm was drawn away, sharp liquor remained,\nwhich Tymme identi\u0002ed as containing sal ammoniac, or ammonium\nchloride. Tymme may have obtained this observation from Duchesne\u2019s\nAd Veritatem Hermeticae Medicinae (1604) in which he had argued sal\nammoniac was closely linked to the mercurial element, and that distilling substances that contained sal ammoniac would result in a mercurial\nwater that was sharp and biting in taste.28 Whatever the source of this\n27\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymical Physicke, fol.

1. <strong>Central Role of Salts</strong>: Salts were considered a fundamental part of early modern chymistry, involved in generating matter, influencing color, taste, and even life itself. Philosophers and physicians viewed salt as both a material and spiritual substance.
   
2. <strong>Paracelsian Ideas</strong>: The text explores Paracelsus&#x27; tria prima (sulphur, mercury, and salt), where salt represents the material body. Paracelsians like Joseph Duchesne and Johann Glauber saw salts as central to processes like the creation of matter and minerallogenesis. Duchesne&#x27;s work, *Practice of Chymicall Physick* (1605), highlighted the &quot;hermaphroditical&quot; salt believed to form matter [*Practice of Chymicall Physick*, 1605, p. 12](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=12).

The first section of the document focuses on the significance of salts in the natural philosophy, medicine, and chymistry of early modern England, particularly between 1650–1750. Below are the key points with specific dates and references:

1. <strong>Central Role of Salts</strong>:
   - In the 17th century, salts were seen as fundamental to understanding matter. Early modern thinkers believed salts played both material and spiritual roles in natural processes, influencing matter formation, plant respiration, and even weather phenomena.
   - Joseph Duchesne (1544–1609), a French physician, and Johann Glauber (1604–1670), a German chymist, both argued that salts were responsible for minerallogenesis (the formation of minerals) and the reproduction of matter. Duchesne&#x27;s *Practice of Chymicall Physick* (1605) introduced the Paracelsian tria prima (salt, mercury, and sulphur), where salt represents the material body and the generative force behind physical substances [*Practice of Chymicall Physick*, 1605, p. 12](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=12).

2. <strong>Paracelsian Concepts of Salts</strong>:
   - Paracelsus (1493–1541), a Swiss physician and alchemist, introduced the tria prima, claiming that all matter consisted of three substances: sulphur, mercury, and salt. These elements were believed to contain both physical and metaphysical properties, guiding matter’s form and function.
   - Paracelsians like Thomas Tymme (d. 1620) adapted these theories in England. Tymme translated Duchesne’s Latin works into English, including *The Practise of Chymicall Physicke* (1605), and emphasized the importance of salt as both a material and spiritual agent.

3. <strong>Johann Glauber and Alkahest</strong>:
   - Glauber, a prominent 17th-century alchemist, discovered sodium sulfate (Glauber’s salt) and considered it vital for alchemical processes. His works, such as *Philosophical Furnaces* (1651), proposed that salts, particularly nitre (saltpeter), were critical for the formation of metals and medicines. Glauber also introduced the idea of the universal solvent, or alkahest, which he believed could break down all substances into their elemental salts [*Philosophical Furnaces*, 1651, p. 55](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=55).

4. <strong>Van Helmont&#x27;s Influence</strong>:
   - Jan Baptista van Helmont (1580–1644), a Flemish physician and chemist, argued that all matter originated from water. He believed salts were volatile and could act as generative agents. His ideas about vital spirits and salts significantly influenced Glauber and later thinkers like Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who worked on theories of respiration and air’s role in chemical reactions [p. 64](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=64).

5. <strong>The Transition to Acid Theories</strong>:
   - By the early 18th century, attention shifted from salts to acidic substances. Saline spirits and acids were increasingly viewed as the driving forces behind natural and chemical processes. This transition is significant in understanding the move from alchemical to chemical science. Chambers’ *Cyclopaedia* (1728) defined salt as a simple acid substance, marking a departure from the broader early modern conception of salts [*Cyclopaedia*, 1728, p. 12](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=12).

As Tymme\ncommented, \u201cfrom this \u0002xed Marine salt, as from the Father and \u0002rst\noriginal, all other sates [saltes] are derived.\u201d31\nPart two of the Practice:\nSalts, \u0002re analysis and the existence of the philosophical salt\nThe idea that distillation would separate a salt into its own constituent\nproperties of \u0002xed, sulphureous, and mercuric qualities was not only was\na re\u0003ection of the Paracelsian idea that substances cannot be divided\ninto more than three substances, but that distillation itself would reveal\nthe base principles of matter. The ef\u0002cacy of \u0002re analysis or distillation\nwas an idea in some dispute in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.32\nParacelsians believed that vaporous fumes in distillation revealed mercury, \u0003ame sulphur, and ashes salt.33 However, as Debus and Shakelford\nhave shown, opponents of Paracelsus such as Erastus believed that \u0002re\nchanged bodies into material that was not part of original bodies, and\nthat heat created new compounds, rather than revealing the building\nblocks of a substance.34\nIn chapter 10 of the Practice, the Paracelsian Tymme railed against\nthinkers like Erastus, stating that in the case of the calcinations of\nsalts, \u201cthe naturall and original moysture in Saltes is not consumed.\u201d35\nHis proof lay in the results of palingenesis, in which one took a plant,\nbruised and burnt it, and then calcinated its ashes, extracting from it\na volatile salt. One then made a compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat; arising from the ashes were salt crystals which\nresembled a stem, leaves and \u0003owers, an apparition of the plant which\nhad been submitted to combustion.36 Although the salt had been reduced\n31\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

Tymme\u2019s interest in plant ashes also symbolized a general trend\nin chymistry. As Ahonen has remarked, although early iatrochymists\nhad a bias towards distillates, the later Paracelsians [such as Duchesne,\nTymme] . . . and Glauber . . . were slowly overcoming the entrenched distaste for residues and extending their chymistry to the appreciation as well\nof the \u0002xed salts that remained behind in the ashes. This was to open up\na whole new \u0002eld of salts (e.g., the nitrates and sulphates).37\nTymme also utilized the example of experiments done by Sieur de Luynes\nor de Formentieres to extract salt from metals via calcination to show\nthat salts were not changed in their composition by the heat of the\n\u0002re. These metallic salts were\nmixed with lye made with ashes of burnt metals, by often powring warme\nwater upon the same, &amp; drawing it through too and againe shewing a\nproofe of his essence, included in the lye after this manner.38\nThe lye was strained through a \u0002lter, cleansed with water, and then\nplaced in a vessel and exposed to the air, whereupon \u201cthere appeared\na thousand forms of mettalls, with all the parts thereto belonging, as\nleaves, stalks, and rootes . . . in such sort as no man could be acknowledge\nthem to be mettals.\u201d39 The precipitation of salts from the lye which\nresembled metallic shapes con\u0002rmed to Tymme that the essence of\nmetallic forms was inherent in the salty ashes, and \u0002re did not destroy\nthis essence. Inspired by biblical text, he then commented, \u201cRemember\nman, that thou art Ashes, and to Ashes againe shalt returne.\u201d40 This\nreasoning was not unique. As Newman has shown, the sixteenth-century\nartist and chymist Bernard Palissy, also in\u0003uenced by Paracelsian ideas,\nbelieved salt\u2019s crystallizing activity showed that it was behind the production of minerals and metals.41\nalchemy and metempsychosis in renaissance medicine,\u201d Ambix 26, 2 ( July 1979), pp.\n81\u201399; A.G.

As Renaissance\nNeo-Platonism proposed there was an imperfect physical, and a perfect\nspiritual reality, Tymme also believed that while there were imperfect\nmaterial salts that contributed tastes and color to material objects, there\nwas also a philosophical or spiritual salt which was animate, hermaphroditical and thus inherently reproductive. In promoting this dualism,\nTymme was re\u0003ecting the entirely typical nature of alchemists to make\nvague distinctions between material principles and their more exalted\nspiritual realities. There had also been a long medieval alchemical tradition \u201cconcerning the exalted dignity of salt as the basic operational force\nin Nature,\u201d and Duchesne and his translator expressed that tradition\nstemming from Raymond Lull\u2019s corpus of sal in rebus omnibus.42\nTymme wrote that within the plant ash there was also a spiritual salt,\na spiritual \u201cIdea, indued with a spirituall essence: which served for no\nother purpose, but to be matched with his \u0002tting earth, that so it might\ntake unto it a more solid body.\u201d43 This existence of this spiritual salt was\nalso shown by the fact that salt was a \u201cbalsam of nature.\u201d Tymme wrote,\n\u201call creatures by a certain natural instinct, doe desire [salt] as a Balsam,\nby which they are preserved, conserved, &amp; doe grow and increase.\u201d44\nBirds and doves sought it out \u201cwith their beaks,\u201d deer gravitated to\nsalt licks, and \u0002sh were \u201cbred and nourished\u201d in the sea.45 Spiritual\nsalts also were generative; salt was said to awake the power of semen,\nand Venus \u201cthe mother and \u0002rst beginner of generation, is begotten\nof the Salt spume or froath of the male;\u201d salt was also thought to be\nresponsible for the generation of pearls and corals in the sea as the\nbranching nature of the coral suggested salt crystals.46 Fertilizing salts\nin marl \u201canimateth, forti\u0002eth, and giveth power\u201d to the earth; as the\nsun caused the volatile salts in wine to vaporize and manifest chymical\nchange, the sun in the springtime elevated and sublimated \u201cthe spirits of\nthe said Salt, and of the balsam of Nature.\u201d47 Salts in the air released\nby sunbeams fell again in the form of dew which contained \u201cthe spirit\n42\nPagel, Smiling Spleen, p. 41.\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

Aristotle\u2019s \u201cworks\ninvolved pairs of opposing qualities, especially hot and cold, moist and\ndry,\u201d and these qualities were analogically connected to solar and lunar\nin\u0003uences on the earth and the human body.48 In On Generation and\nCorruption, he wrote that the sun releases heat which effects generation\nof life on earth.49 However, because the sun was made of a perfect\nand immutable \u0002fth element or aether, the sun\u2019s heat was attributed\nto its motion only, because the heat and light which it emitted were\n\u201cengendered as the air was chafed by . . . its movement.\u201d50 In the body,\nAristotle associated the \u201chot\u201d motive quality of the sun with the masculine vital heat or active \u201csoul-principle\u201d of the semen. The source of\nthe vital heat of the semen was the pneuma, which was \u201canalogous to\nthe element which belongs to the stars,\u201d or the divine \u0002fth element or\naether; the pneuma was analogous to aether is that it was generative,\nbecause the Sun, which was also made of aether, was a means of\ncreation.51 Aristotle thus concluded that\nthe heat of the sun does effect generation, and so does the heat of\nanimals . . . which operates through the semen. The physical part of the\nsemen, which . . . is accompanied by the portion of soul-principle and\nacts as its vehicle . . . [enters] the uterus . . . [and] it sets the residue produced by the female and imports to it the same movement with which\nit is itself endowed.52\nOther English Paracelsian physicians such as Thomas Moffet also connected salts to lusty behavior. Thomas Moffett (1553\u20131604) studied\nmedicine at Basel, wrote a manuscript on entomology which was pub48\nJoan Cadden, Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1996), p. 21.\n49\nAristotle, \u201cOn Generation and Corruption,\u201d in The Complete Works of Aristotle. 2\nvols. ed Jonathan Barnest (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 2.10.336b,\nlines 16\u201324.\n50\nAristotle, On the Heavens, trans.

Moffett had also written the preface of the of\u0002cial pharmacopoeia of the London College of Physicians\nthat was devoted to Paracelsian chymical remedies.53 If we examine\nMoffet\u2019s works on diet\u2014the Health\u2019s Improvements or Rules Comprising and\nDiscovering the Nature, Method, and Manner of Preparing all Sorts of Food Used\nin this Nation\u2014we see that he claimed:\nExperience teacheth, that Mice lying in Holes laden . . . with Salt, breed\nthrice faster there, then if they were laden with other Merchandize. Huntsmen likewise and shepherds seeing a slowness of lust in their Dogs and\nCattle, feed them with Salt means to hasten coupling; and what maketh\nDoves and Goats so lusty and lascivious that they desire to feed upon\nsalt things. Finally remember, that lechery (in Latin) is not idlely or at\nadventure termed Salaritus, Saltishness, or every man knows that the\nsalter our humours be, the more prone and inclinable we are to lechery.\nWherefore whosoever coveteth to be freed of that \u0002re . . . let them altogether abstaine from Salt.54\nAfter establishing that salt was inherently generative, Tymme then went\non to postulate which salt in particular exempli\u0002ed this formative and\nspiritual salt principle, and decided that nitre, particularly an aerial\nnitre (in modern terms, potassium nitrate), was the best candidate.\nParacelsus said that nitre arose \u201cfrom the union of urine and the\nuniversal natural balsam,\u201d that nitre was uniquely able to bring about\nmany of the Arcana of alchemy.55 While Paracelsus\u2019 followers such as\nPeter Severinus, English chymist Robert Bostocke, and Gerard Dorn\nassociated nitre with the vital sulphur, ens astrale or summa vitalis, any\nsixteenth-century references to an aerial nitre were con\u0002ned to plague\nmiasmas or to a theory of thunder and lightening involving the explosive force of gunpowder. As Parthington, Guerlac, and Debus have\nillustrated, it was not until the seventeenth century that the belief in a\n53\nAllen Debus, \u201cParacelsus: Five Hundred Years, Three American Exhibits at the\nNational Library of Medicine,\u201d http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_2.html.

Ammonia from the decomposition of\nurea in dung heaps would produce nitrate, and nitre-beds were cultivated in the early modern period by mixing manure and ashes, along\nwith straw to create a compost pile; the compost pile was periodically\nkept moist with urine and leached with water. The liquid containing\nthe nitrates was then converted with ashes to potassium nitrates which\nwere re\u0002ned into gunpowder. Tymme postulated that since nitre was\npartially extracted from of earth, usually taken out of old stables, it had\na mineral quality. Because it also came from \u201chints of grounds which\nhave been replenished with salt liquor,\u201d nitre also had animal origins.\nFinally, since \u201curines are nothing else, but a super\u0003uous separation of\nthe Salt of vegetables, by which living creatures are nourished,\u201d nitre\nhad a vegetable nature.58 Because vegetables absorbed nitre from the\nsoil, especially in their roots, medicines distilled from vegetable matter\nwould also contain a gentler saline medicament and purge; the salts\n\u201cwere not altogether so violent, and of so homogenous a spirit, as they\nwere in their . . . original.\u201d59\nTymme also claimed that nitre was hermaphroditical, \u201cmale and\nfemale: \u0002xed and volatile, Agent and Patient, and which is more, hot\nand cold: \u0002er and Ice, but mutual friendship and sympathie joined in\none.\u201d60 Very \u0002ne gold and silver will dissolve in solutions of nitric acid\ncontaining chlorine, and virtually all soil contains signi\u0002cant quantities\nof chloride salts; since alchemists attributed male and female qualities\nto gold and silver, a substance that could dissolve both also seemed to\ncontain a unity of opposites. Like all other salts, nitre also had within\nitself \u0002xed, as well as volatile, sulphureous and mercurial qualities.

Tymme thus claimed, \u201cPlato writeth,\nthat this Salt, is a friend and familiar to divine things.\u201d61\nIndeed, this philosophical salt not only was behind the structure of\nthe sublunary world, but postulated to be part of the fabric of heaven.\nIn Chapter XII of the Practice, which was devoted to Genesis, Tymme\nclaimed that out of the Chaos, the tria prima was formed. Tymme\nwrote,\nThis was the worke of God, that he might separate and pure from the\nimpure; that is to say, that he might reduce the more pure and ethereal\nMercury, the more pure and inextinguible Sulphur, the more pure, and\nmore \u0002xed salte, into shyning and inextinguible Starres and Lights, into\na Christalline and Dyamantine Substance.62\nIn other words, the \u201c\u0002xed Heavens, or Vitriall and Chrystallyne circles,\nis a salt body,\u201d which had was so shining and pure that a \u201cDiamond,\nwhich partaketh of the nature of \u0002xed salt, is not of more puritie,\ncontinuance, and perpetuitie than they are.\u201d63 This is another example\nof the integration of the Aristotelian system with the Paracelsian; the\nAristotelian \u0002fth element or ether, described by a \u0002fteenth-century\nEnglish encyclopedia as \u201cresplendour perpetual . . . so clear and shining\u201d which composed the crystalline orbital spheres of the planets, has\nbeen transformed into the philosophical salt principle.64 As salt was the\n\u201cfoundation of the whole frame\u201d of the microcosm of man, his very\n\u201cbones, sinews, and ligaments\u201d composed of saline substance, so was\nsalt the framework of the macrocosm of the heavens.65\nSalts and Disease in Paracelsian Medicine\nThese concepts of physical and spiritual salts were not con\u0002ned to\ntheoretical chymical tracts, but appeared in works devoted to practical Paracelsian medicine.

If a foreign agent, which could be\nfood or a planetary in\u0003uence, disturbed the union of the tria prima, as\nPagel stated:\nsulphur could be released from its union with the other principles . . . and\ndevour the mercury. If [mercury] becomes too strong it will coagulate salt\nand sulphur or else dissolve the salt. All such disorder and imbalance spells\ninterference by an outside force . . . By contrast, ancient humoralism had\nconcentrated on inside components such as this or that humour acquiring\ndestructive qualities and thus causing disease. Instead it is abnormal ignition of sulphur that consumes the radical moisture in man; it dissipates\nthe mercury which was to be separated in the stomach for nutrition of\nthe whole of the body with the result of emaciation . . . and hectic fever.\nThe agent disturbing the union of the principles introduced with the\nfood; it is of \u2018excremental\u2019 nature and thus indigestible. Moreover\u2014unlike\nnormal excrement\u2014it does not leave the body again, but forms local\n[salt] deposits\u2014tartar\u2014that obstruct the preformed anatomical channels\ncausing diseases by obstruction.67\nThe most common disease which manifested these obstructions of salty\ntartar was gout. The coagulation of Salts into tartar caused, according\nto Tymme, \u201cswelling, stones, and knots of the sinews,\u201d manifested in\ngout.

For every voiding of Ordure is caused by the Salt, both in sound\nmen, and sick; One is the Salt of Nature, (viz. the sound mans). The other\nis a corrupted and resolved Salt [Tartar]: From hence tis to be gathered,\nthat even by Salts the Cure of it is to be perfected, in such wise, that the\nSalt may again recti\u0002ed and separate the resolved Salt from the Sound.69\nIn his discussion of purges for tartarous disease, Tymme concentrated\nparticularly upon antimony, and in Chapter XVI of the Practice, described a triad of medicines\u2014mercurial, antimonial, and arsenicals\nthat would respectively cure mercurious, saline, and sulphureous diseases.70 Thought to be \u201csweet as Cassia,\u201d antimony was considered \u201ca\nseparated Salt.\u201d Paracelsus commented\nOf all minerals antimony contains the highest and strongest Arcanum\n[remedy]. It puri\u0002es itself and at the same time everything else that is\nimpure. Furthermore, if there is nothing healthy at all inside the body, it\ntransforms the impure body into a pure one which was proved in cases\nof leprosy.71\nIn doing so, Tymme was using inorganic materials like \u201cmercurials,\nantimonials, and the mineral acids in internal medicines\u201d in the nascent\nperiod of medical chemistry prior to 1600.72 As McCallum has demon-\n68\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

In a series of decrees and court cases this powerful body tried to forbid any use of chemistry in medicine. Nevertheless,\npublishers continued to print books favoring medical chemistry, and by\nthe early years of the new century courses in the preparation of pharmaceutical chemicals were available in Paris.75\nEven before such controversies, Paracelsus himself recognized that its\ntoxic nature meant that antimony had to be alchemically puri\u0002ed. As\nArndt has described, Paracelsus believed that antimony had to be \u201cfree\nof its toxicity\u201d before medical usage, and as Paracelsus wrote, \u201cIn the\nsame way and form that antimony \u0002nishes in gold (in the sense of\ncleansing), it will perfect the body as well. It namely contains the\nEssentia, which does not allow anything impure to come together with\nthe pure.\u201d Historian of chemistry David Schein has indicated in a course\nof modern experiments that when antimony is added to a combination of melted metals, it \u201cwill associate with those containing gold and\npart from the \u2018impure\u2019 metals. Because antimony seemingly \u2018eats\u2019 and\n\u2018extracts\u2019 the precious metals, it was also called \u2018wolf of metals\u2019 or \u2018the\nmagnet of the wise.\u2019 \u201d76\nThis ability of antimony was thus thought by Tymme to have a\nsimilar effect in man as well, purging toxins and obstructions such as\n73\nIan McCallum, Antimony in Medical History: An Account of the Medical Uses of Antimony\nand Its Compounds since Early Times to the Present (Bishop Auckland, England: Pentland\nPress, 1999).\n74\nKate Frost, \u201cPrescription and Devotion: The reverend Doctor Donne the Learned\nDoctor Mayerne\u2014Two Seventeenth-Century Records of Epidemic Typhoid Fever,\u201d\nMedical History, 22 (1978), pp. 408\u2013419, on p. 413; Ulrich Arndt, \u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s\nMagnet: Alchemical Transmutation of Antimony,\u201d Paracelsus, (November 2005), pp.\n12\u201317.\n75\nAllen Debus, Paracelsus: Five Hundred Years, Three American Exhibits at the National\nLibrary of Medicine, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_\n2.html.

And, Tymme in the Practice indeed associated\nantimony with a magnetic loadstone, not only because of its ability like\na magnet to attract other metals, but because like salt and like iron,\nantimony \u201cwas more corpulent like other things.\u201d In other words, just\nlike salt, antimony gave bodily substance to matter, and like nitrous salt,\nit had ability to dissolve metals, and was called by Paracelsus, \u201cthe true\nbath of gold.\u201d Like other saline substances, antimony could also be\nmelted into a glass-like substance, and was thought to contain all bodily\ncharacteristics of matter within itself. At the University of Munich,\nSchein performed a series of modern experiments according to a\nformula of the alchemist Basilius Valentinus in the Triumph-Waggon of\nAntimony (1604). Schein slowly and gently heated antimony-ore, which\nconsists of a mixture of different antimony-oxides and especially of\nsulphides, until there were no more toxic fumes, and everything was\nmelted to glass.77 Because the glass can adopt any color of the spectrum,\njust as nitre heated in an alembic displayed all colors, this was proof\nto Valentinus and Paracelsian chemists like Duchesne that antimony\nwas like a salt that contained all qualities within it.78\nDuchesne\u2019s contemporary, Turquet de Mayerne, also theorized about\nthe uses of saline medicaments. Educated at Heidelberg, Montpellier,\nand Paris, he became one of the physicians-in-ordinary to Henry IV,\nmuch like Duchesne. In 1603, Mayerne became involved in the antimony wars and with Duchesne was condemned in the Apologia Medicine\nper Hippocratis et Galeni, contra Mayernium et Quercetanum. In 1607, Mayerne\ncame to England and formed intellectual connections with the English\ncourt, and after the assassination of Henry IV, became a court physician to James I.79\nIn his treatise of gout translated from the French by English court\nphysician Thomas Sherley (1638\u20131678), Mayerne explicated his doc-\n77\nArndt, \u201cThe Philosopher\u2019s Magnet,\u201d p. 14.\nFor a description of Paracelsus\u2019 preparation of antimonial medicine, see chapter\n14 in Paracelsus his Aurora, &amp; Treasure of the Philosophers.

As a Paracelsian, Mayerne\ndisregards any primary causative role of the Galenic humors in gout,\nproclaiming that it arose when salt \u201cexceeds and abounds\u201d the ability\nof the body to absorb it. In normal digestion, the aliment is \u201cdissolv\u2019d\ninto the Chyle,\u201d which is separated into the salt, sulphur and mercury.\nSalts are communicated to the blood, forming a Balsam for the body,\nand excess salts were excreted \u0002rst in the urine, and then \u201csent off by\nSweat,\u201d where they degenerate into thick \u201cscurse and foulness, sticking to the skin.\u201d81 When the body was unable to process excess salts in\nbodily liquids, salt would \u201cin\u0003ame the parts, and vacillates and gnaws\nthem,\u201d causing the pain of arthritis.82 Hence the \u201cErratick Gout\u201d which\n\u201cshifteth placed, sparing no joint, but invading all of them successively,\u201d\nand which had as its root cause a salty \u0003ood of humors, was best cured\nby \u201chydragogol,\u201d or water-purging humors like syrup of the salt of\nhartshorn (ammonium carbonate).83 If there were such a quantity of salt\nthat could not be absorbed by bodily liquors, then of necessity \u201cit will\nbe stopt in its passages and Vessells . . . and be coagulated into different\nsort of Stones, according to the nature of predominant Salts.\u201d\nHere the crystalline shapes of gouty tartarous concretions could be\nanalyzed to see if what types of salts were responsible, and Mayerne\nnoted the similarity of the growth of nodules in the body to salts made\nby chymical processes, as well as to minerals in the earth,\nNay, he that shall remove his contemplations from the Coagulations of\nSalts, to those which happen to Stones and Marcasit[e]s, he shall \u0002nd\nseveral of them so elaborately form\u2019d according to Geometrical Rules,\nthat he will be forced to acknowledge that Art is out-done by Nature.84\n(We shall see in the next chapter that microscopic analyses of salt\ncrystals for the purposes of classi\u0002cation became a common practice\nin the late seventeenth century.)\n80\nTheodor Turquet De Mayerne, A Treatise of the Gout.

If the salts responsible for gouty pains were\nvolatile, they would be diffused throughout the body, and best treated\nby internal medicines which would also diffuse readily, like salt of\ntartar dissolved in water; so although here Mayerne is following the\n\u201clike cures like\u201d Paracelsian principle, he is also taking into account\nthe chymical composition of the salt responsible.85 Purges like the salt\nof tartar, or spirit of salt (hydrochloric acid) would also rid the body\nof the tartarous deposits and \u201cslime stuck to the sides of the stomach,\u201d\nrelieving the disease\u2019s symptoms, and it \u201ccould lead salt matter away\nthrough the urine.\u201d86\nMayerne also thought that nitre in particular could also be a good\npurge, but only if taken in the wane of the moon, which showed a\ncurious mix of Galenic and Paracelsian principles in his treatments.\nParacelsian medicine, again in a \u201clike cures like\u201d manner, predicted the\nnitrous salt would dissolve kidney and bladder stones. The stricture to\ntake the medicine at the wane of the moon was an old Hippocratic and\nGalenic belief in astronodia, the belief attributed to Hippocrates that\nthe presence of the moon in different signs of the zodiac in\u0003uenced the\nhumoral content of various parts of the body.87 The moon was thought\nto be \u201ccold and moist, of the nature of Water,\u201d and hence \u201cprognosticateth such as proceed of watry humours, citrine water, and salt\n\u0003egm, for the most part with swellings and breakings out . . . retention\nof menstrua, and all other excrements, as . . . urine and Sweat, and the\ninordinate evacuation of them\u201d as well as lymphatic diseases such as\nscrofula.88 Because the moon had to do with the retention and evacuation of bodily \u0003uids, its position in the zodiac dictated the best time\nfor administering the humoral therapy of phlebotomy, which purged\n85\nNance also notes that Mayerne did not slavishly adhere to \u201clike cures like,\u201d but\nlimits his analysis to de Mayerne\u2019s use of chymical contraries, such as a sweet salt balancing a sour one.

In the wane of the moon, the bodily \u0003uids were\nat lower levels, and a purge such as nitre would therefore be less dilute\nin the body, effecting more purgation.\nMayerne also rather typically implicated the stomach in most gouty\ndiseases, postulating that the stomach failed to separate excremental\nmatter which was intrinsic to food. Thus, he also prescribed the usual\ndietary cautions of avoiding salted meats and strong wines with their\nexcess tartar; wine could be watered down, or sugar of lead (lead acetate)\ncould be added to wines that abounded with a \u201cvitrioline tartar, sharp\nand pricking,\u201d resulting in its precipitating out (likely the precipitate\nwas acetic acid).90\nHe also told patients to avoid venery, which \u201cstirred up salt humors\u201d\nand made the patient weak, again emphasizing the connection between\nsalt and generative principles.91 A sweet salt such as sugar of lead, which\nhe believed mitigated and sweetened the humors, could also abate\nvenereal desires by tempering the humors\u2019 saltiness.92\nGlauber, the nitrous alkahest, and the vitrioline sal mirabile\nIn the \u0002rst half of the seventeenth century, Paracelsian physicians and\nchemists thus utilized different combinations of Aristotelian elements\nand Paracelsian principles to suit their practical and philosophical\nbeliefs about saline chemistry. We have thus seen so far that salt was\nthought to be a primary component of physical matter, its chymical\ncomposition affected secondary qualities of matter such as taste and\ncolor. Its balance in the body was important; if too prevalent, salt would\ncoalesce into tarterous obstructions that could cause gout, arthritis, and\nkidney and bladder stones. In a philosophical and spiritual sense, salt\nwas thought to be inherently generative, reproductive, and connected\n89\nSee Charles W.

His project, De Nitro Theses quaedam, a brief tract containing\na synopsis of current chemical theory about saltpetre, and miscellaneous experimental evidence was based on Paracelsian chemistry.96\nThe Kincardine Papers of Sir Robert Moray, an early Royal Society\n\u0002gure, also illustrated that he consulted Glauber\u2019s medical works extensively.97 Glauber\u2019s work was also translated and published in England\nthroughout the seventeenth century; it thus seems Glauber\u2019s ideas on\nsalts are important to consider in our analysis of the context of English\nsalt chymistry.\nGlauber, born in Karlstadt, Bavaria, was one of the \u0002rst industrial chymists and best known for the stomach remedy\u2014Glauber\u2019s\nsalt\u2014sodium sulphate. He was self-taught, and in the upheaval of the\nThirty Year\u2019s War, traveled to Vienna when he was 21 years old.98 As\nColin Russell related, Glauber became ill with a stomach bug known as\n\u2018the Hungarian disease.\u2019 As he was unable to keep down solid food, he\nwas \u201crecommended to try drinking water from a spring near Neustadt.\nImprovising a cup by hollowing out part of a loaf he imbibed some of\nthe \u0003uid and was cured with astonishing rapidity.\u201d99 Curious to know\nthe cause of his recovery, he evaporated the water and obtained long\nthin crystals that seemed similar to nitre. Glauber however subsequently\nshowed that the salt in question was not nitre. Glauber wrote, \u201cfor it\ncould not be the water of Saltpetre seeing that in no wise conduceth\nto the stomach, but rather occasioneth nauseousness and loathing.\u201d100\nRather, Glauber concluded it \u201cthe same compound as that obtained\nwhen vitriol (sulphuric acid) acted on common salt\u201d or sodium sulphate.101 Since sodium sulphate has laxative qualities, it well could\nhave effected his cure. The sodium sulphate was termed by Glauber\nas sal mirabile or miraculous salt.

As Porto has demonstrated, the\nalkahest began as an \u201cobscure invention of Paracelsus,\u201d and became\nwidely known in the early modern era as one of physician Johann van\nHelmont\u2019s most important secrets.103 Glauber thought the alkahest was\nnitre or potassium nitrate because its products could be both very acidic\nand very basic, both of which were corrosive.104 For instance, nitre could\nbe distilled with fuller\u2019s earth or vitriol to make nitric acid (spirit of\nnitre or volatile nitre), a strong acid or, it could be \u201c\u0002xed\u201d by burning\nit with charcoal, producing potassium carbonate, a very powerful base.\nBecause products from nitre could be very acidic, or very basic, Glauber\n\u0002rst published in 1633 that it was a universal solvent. Porto claims correctly that Glauber believed the alkahest stemmed from but a family\nof substances that included \u201cnitre itself, nitric acid (produced by the\ndistillation of saltpeter), and potassium carbonate (produced by adding\ncharcoal to fused nitre).\u201d105 In Glauber\u2019s Apology against Farner, published\nin 1652, which was largely a diatribe against his former research partner whom he accused of stealing his chymical secrets, he gives fairly\ndetailed instructions for preparing his nitrous alkahest. Glauber \u0002rst\nargues that\nwhat moved Helmont to call it Alkahest, we shall not here dispute: In\nindeed believe he did it, thereby to demonstrate its Nature and Essence;\nin the Brabantick Idiom, which was the Mother Tongue of the Authors\nit sounds Althohees, that is very hot; and so the name answers to the\n102\nAhonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in SeventeenthCentury Chemistry,\u201d p. 95.\n103\nPaolo A.

This Menstruum then, is nothing but igneous Liquor, prepared\nof urinous Salts.106\nThis alkahest was from related nitrous salts for\nNature is copious, and sets before our eyes many various Ingredients,\nfrom which, by the help of Arts, divers things may be effected . . . for the\ngenuine Sal terra, or Salt-Petre, may be made of Salt of Tartar; and of\nSal terra, or Nitre, a \u0002xed Salt, like Salt of Tartar; of spirit of Wine, Salt\nof Tartar, and of Salt of Tartar spirit of Wine; of Wine-Vinegar, Nitre,\nand of Nitre, corrosive Vinegar. So those Salts partake of either nature\nand will be managed at pleasure.107\nJust as Tymme in the Practice utilized the heating of wine and its vinegar to show that a triad of \u0002xed, sulphureous, and mercurious salts\nall stemmed from one material salt which was responsible for bodily\nsubstance, colors and tastes, Glauber argued that calcining wine produced a variety of interchangeable saline products that were all alkahests\ncapable of re\u0002ning matter. For instance, salt of tartar, often found as a\ncrustlike deposit on wine casks, was a traditional raw material for the\npreparation of potassium carbonate after calcination.108\nIt was no accident that Glauber\u2019s alkahest came from products of\nwine. Some of this state of affairs may have been due to the in\u0003uence of\nVan Helmont. In Van Helmont\u2019s Arcana Paracelsi, he claimed \u201cEminentior\nest ejus liquor Alkahest immortalis, immutabilis aqua solvens, et sal circulatus ejus,\nqui reducit omne corpus tangibile, in liquorem sui concreti.\u201d109 In other words,\nthere was a liquor alkahest and its sal circulatus; the sal circulatus as\nDarnstaedter illustrated was an alcoholic solution.110\nThe spirit of wine (ethanol) was also the prime solvent for preparing\nGlauber\u2019s aurum potabile, a drinkable tincture of gold.

Anthony\u2019s aurum potabile was a potent emetic and cathartic\nthat was as likely to cure his patients as kill them.111 Anthony, like Glauber, wished to \u0002nd a means to dissolve an insoluble substance like gold\nand make its healing properties digestable.112 Hence Glauber used his\nalkahest to achieve that aim. Glauber believed that this \u201ctincture, which\nthey have radically joyned with the spirit of Wine,\u201d was a \u201cheating and\nliving spirit, communicating its strength and faculties to man\u2019s body.\u201d113\nThe aurum potabile contained the vivifying power of the sun; taking the\nspirit of wine chymically combined with gold would cure the body by\nengendering in a chymically concentrated increase of the \u201chumidum\nradicale\u201d or vital spirits that one would attain in lesser concentrations\nby basking in the sun.114 The potency of the aurum potabile also demonstrated the \u201cgreatest harmony of all things, betwixt the Sun, Gold,\nman and wine.\u201d115 Behind this harmony were the nitrous salts of the\nalkahest\u2014the aerial nitre Glauber postulated was in sunbeams made\nvines grow to produce wine, engendered the growth of minerals like\ngold in the bowels of the earth, and nitre was also in human urine,\nfurthering the macrocosm, microcosm analogy. As Glauber stated,\nthere is nothing can be brought forth in the nature of things, without the\nmedium of salt; yea man himself is not born without the Sun, Man, and\nSalt. . . . The sun and salt are the Parents of all things, which procreate\nall things and without nothing is procreated. . . . Salt being added to Wine\nin its fermentation, rendereth it stronger and sweeter.116\nBecause the alkahest of nitre broke down matter to its most basic level,\nand because salts were thought responsible for color, Glauber produced\na comprehensive list of how nitre could be used to create artist\u2019s paints\nand differently hued glazes.

Glauber also knew that nitric acid would stain nails,\nfeathers, or quills gold, and it could be utilized as a purple glaze in\npottery. The acid\u2019s af\u0002nity with precious metals also meant that when\nit was mixed and heated with gold, silver, or copper along with some\nantimony, a \u201cvitri\u0002ed\u201d pottery glaze could be made that would \u201cfar\nexceed in beauty or splendour those vessels which are gilt with those\nMetals.\u201d118\nSome contemporaries of Glauber, such as Sir Robert Moray, a\nfounder of the Royal Society, had great regard for Glauber\u2019s alkahest,\nas well as his other medicaments, such as Glauber\u2019s panacea antimonialis.\nThis was probably antimony pentasulphide as described in Glauber\u2019s\nMiraculum Mundi, though Moray stated that \u201cI guess by the color (red)\nit is rather some preparation of vitriol.\u201d119 In a letter to his friend and\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alexander Bruce, Moray wrote, \u201cPut your doctor to a further\nenquiry about that powder of Glauberus, I beseech you, for if he hold\nall he heights there is not two remedies in the world preferable to it.\u201d120\nHe warned Bruce however to get the powder of Glauber\u2019s \u201cown making,\u201d as if it was not, the medicinal results would likely \u201cblast\u201d Glauber\u2019s\n\u201creputation when everybody that meddles in his trade thinks him one\nof the noblest chimists now living.\u201d121\nMoray put his \u0002nger on a problem that Glauber had among his fellow natural philosophers. Glauber\u2019s work was not always considered\nclearly expressed by his contemporaries. Not only was Glauber fairly\nvague about the exact nature of his alkahest in an attempt to shield its\nidentity from all but alchemical adepti, but his use of chymical terms\ncould be inconsistent.

The text delves into <strong>Paracelsian theories</strong> of salts, analyzing their transformative properties in alchemical and medical practices. The primary discussion revolves around salt&#x27;s dual nature—both material and spiritual.

- <strong>Fire Analysis</strong>: Paracelsians like Duchesne and Tymme believed that salt could be revealed through fire analysis. While some critics argued that fire altered the original nature of substances, Paracelsians contended that the essential nature of salt remained intact even after calcination. Experiments, such as palingenesis, demonstrated that salts could regenerate plant-like forms from ashes, symbolizing salt’s role as a &quot;balsam of nature&quot; [Duchesne, *Practice of Chymicall Physicke*, 1605, p. 36](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=36).

- <strong>Spiritual vs. Material Salts</strong>: Alchemists argued that while there were physical salts responsible for taste and color, spiritual salts were generative. This idea was tied to alchemical traditions stemming from thinkers like <strong>Raymond Lull</strong>. Tymme&#x27;s work suggested that salts contributed to fertility, reproduction, and growth in nature, demonstrating the inherent generative power of spiritual salts [p. 42](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=42).

- <strong>Johann Glauber’s Alkahest</strong>: Glauber (1604–1670) viewed nitre as a key ingredient in the universal solvent, or alkahest, capable of breaking down all substances. His works, such as *Philosophical Furnaces* (1651), highlighted how salts, especially nitre, were instrumental in medicine, agriculture, and chymistry. Glauber’s ideas were especially influential in the Hartlib Circle, which was dedicated to practical applications of natural philosophy [p. 55](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=55).

Young has also\ncommented on how Glauber\u2019s reputation declined severely in England\nat the time of the Restoration.127\nGlauber\u2019s failure with nitre led him to turn his attention to his sal\nmirabile, which was of a fundamentally different nature than his alkahest. His philosophical salt was not a mere dissolvent, but was behind\nthe creation of matter, such as minerals and metals. As revealed in his\nTreatise of the Nature of Salts, Glauber\u2019s philosophical salt was sodium\nsulphate, (Na2SO4\u202210H2O; this decahydrate became known as Glauber\u2019s\nsalt), a combination of common salt and spirit of vitriol (sulphuric acid).\nIn this reaction, hydrochloric acid is also produced from sodium chloride\nand sulphuric acid in which case the Na2SO4 is known as salt cake:\n2 NaCl + H2SO4 o Na2SO4 + 2 HCl\nSodium sulphate may have been Glauber\u2019s choice for his sal mirabile\nbecause one of its reactants\u2014vitriol\u2014had the advantage of being\n\u201cconveniently assimilable\u201d to some of the principles of to the Paracelsian tria prima of salt, sulphur, mercury.128 Vitriol was a salt in the form\nof iron II sulphate produced when pyrites were exposed to moist air,\nand the vitriolic liquid or sulphureous spirit of vitriol (sulphuric acid)\ncalled \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur\u2019 was believed by Glauber and other early modern\nmining authors such as Agricola to be a sign of the presence of metals as well as the petrifaction of wood.129 Glauber in his Philosophical\nFurnaces wrote extensively of the production of sulphuric acid from the\nmixture of pyrites\u2014iron or copper sulphates, with water, and called\nvitriol a \u201cmetallical seed.\u201d130 He also commented that \u201cno sulphur is\ndestitute of vitriol, nor vitriol of sulphur . . . and every sulphur is by its\n126\nThe Hartlib Papers, Hartlib to John Winthrop the younger, 16 March 1660,\nRef: 7/7/3B.\n127\nJ.T.

This \u201csulphureous\nsalt . . . holds stubbornly\u201d to the metal \u201cuntil full maturation has been\nachieved, at which time it separates from the metal as no longer\nneeded.\u201d136 Typical to most mining authors such as Agricola, Glauber\nbelieved that minerals and metals were found at various stages of maturity\u2014immature minerals were bismuth or arsenic, those of middling\nmaturity, the base metals like lead, and \u0002nally when a metal was fully\n131\nAhonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in Seventeenth-Century\nChemistry,\u201d p. 138.\n132\nN.G.

Van Helmont also noted that vitriol was merely a hungry\nhermaphroditical and sulphureous salt which had eaten into a metal like brass, until\nit matured. See Glauber, A Third Paradox, p. 695.\n\nPages 60:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n43\nmature, it would become gold.137 The sal mirabile was thus most prevalent\nin immature metals, and not present in the fully mature gold.138 But the\ngeneration of hard metals from the delicate sal mirabile was a ticklish\nbusiness. If not brought to maturity, and exposed to air too soon by\nimpatient miners, \u201ctheir life consisting in a Volatile Salt, is elevated and\ndrawn back by the stars.\u201d139 If exposed too soon to water, Glauber also\nclaimed the tender salts of the embryonic metals would dissolve. And,\nwhen metals were removed prematurely from the earth,\nfrom which they have no more nutriment, their sulphureous covering being\nlaid aside, the defense and safeguard of their Nature being banished, they\nrightly resemble a decrepit Old Man, whose Radical moisture is dried\nup and are dissolved and eaten up by the same Astral Salt, or Vehement\nCorruscation, from which they did spring.140\nWhen exposed to air, metallic sul\u0002des, like copper and iron pyrites (fools\u2019\ngold or iron sul\u0002des\u2014(FeS2), obtain a green sulphureous or vitriolic\ntarnish (iron II sulphate), which may have led to Glauber\u2019s idea that\nthe \u201csulphureous coat\u201d was protecting growing metals.\nGlauber then discussed the medicinal virtues of his sal mirabile.\nHe claimed that when sal mirabile was heated with gold producing a\ngreen salt and a phlegm, and the green salt was extracted with Spirit\nof Wine (ethanol), he obtained his \u201cgreen lyon,\u201d or his \u201cvitriol of Sol\n[gold].\u201d141 As a product of the philosophical \u201csalt, gold, and wine,\u201d the\nmedicine\u2019s green liquor renewed the body, as the \u201cgreenness of the\nTrees half dead . . . in the Spring time,\u201d caused the \u201cblood in the body\nto be renewed and revived.\u201d142 It is not entirely clear what the chymical\ncomposition was of this \u201cvitriol of Sol.\u201d Glauber also vehemently denied\n137\nSee Ahonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in SeventeenthCentury Chemistry,\u201d p. 135, as well as Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature: Women,\nEcology and the Scienti\u0002c Revolution (San Francisco: Harper San Francisco, 1990), pp. 25\u201341\nfor a discussion of the maturation of metals. In other places Glauber claimed that an\nacid spirit within the sulphureous sal mirabile protected the \u201ctender salt\u201d of the embryonic\nmetal from destruction, allowing it to mature to its \u0002nal form. He wrote, \u201cThat mineral\nacid which is plentifully found in vitriol and sulphur is the only Agent whereby Nature\nMaturates the yet volatile and unripe Minerals in the earth,\u201d and in another tract that\nthe ripening agent in the earth was the sulphureous salt of vitriol.\n138\nAhonen, \u201cJohann Rudolph Glauber: A Study of Animism in Seventeenth-Century\nChemistry,\u201d p. 105.\n139\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 124.\n140\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 124.\n141\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 265.\n142\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 266.\n\nPages 61:\n44\nchapter two\nits green color was the result of any copper compounds; he also claimed\nhe was not merely dissolving gold in aqua regia (nitric and hydrochloric\nacid) to get his green lyon, claiming such a mixture would be gold in\ncolor (it is actually yellowish-green and a method still utilized by jewelers\nto purify gold).143 It is possible that Glauber may have utilized a mixture\nof real and fool\u2019s gold, as the salt of green vitriol, produced by the\nexposure of pyrites to moist air, dissolved in ethanol would make a\ngreen solution. His description of the oil of vitriol produced from\npyrites in his Philosophical Furnaces is also remarkably similar to that of\nthe vitriol of sol; both solutions resulted from dissolving green salts\nin water or alcohol, were bright green in color, and produced similar\nmedical cures.144 Further he indicates in the Philosophical Furnaces that\nboth the \u201cgold Marcasites\u201d of pyrites as well as \u201cgold ore\u201d can produce\nthe oil of vitriol, which he calls as a medicine the \u201cgold of physicians,\u201d\nsuggesting he saw marcasites and gold as functionally equivalent in the\nproduction of medicines.145\nGlauber\u2019s vitriol of sol also defended humanity from putrefaction\nand corruption, as it was made from the \u201cmost noble part of Salt,\u201d\nand the purest metal of Gold; though Glauber does not speci\u0002cally\nclaim it was the philosopher\u2019s stone, he may have had in his mind this\nassociation. Some chymists postulated vitriol itself was the philosopher\u2019s\nstone; common until the eighteenth century was the \u201cvitriol acrostic\u201d:\nVisita Interiora Terrae Recti\u0002cando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (visit the interior\nof the earth; by rectifying you will \u0002nd the hidden stone.)146 Glauber\nhimself mentions this acrostic in his Philosophical Furnaces and stated\nthe ancients by this verse \u201cwould give us to understand that a true\nmedicine is to be found in it.\u201d147\nGlauber also emphasized water as an important medium of transport\nfor the sal mirabile. He asked,\n143\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 267.\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, pp. 70\u201373. In the Furnaces, he\ndescribes this oil of vitriol as a \u201csweet oil\u201d of vitriol, usually known as ether, made\nfrom distilling ethanol and sulphuric acid. However, the process in which he describes\nmaking his oil of vitriol does not involve ethanol, but the exposure of pyrites to moist\nair, and the collection of the green crystals. The green salts were mixed with water,\nand evaporated several times until a \u201csweet oil or juyce\u201d resulted.\n145\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, p. 70.\n146\nSee Emerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 210, footnote 2.\n147\nGlauber, A Description of New Philosophical Furnaces, p. 73.\n144\n\nPages 62:\nparacelsian concepts of salts\n45\nwherefore did the ancient Philosopher and Poets worship Venus, the Goddess of . . . Generation, and attribute to her a beautiful green, generated\nof the spume or foam of the sea.

Though Glauber does not mention\nVan Helmont as a factor in these conclusions, it is possible Glauber\u2019s\nspeculations may have been partially fueled by Helmont\u2019s belief that\nwater consisted of corpuscles made up of the tria prima and thus was\nthe source of transformations of matter.149 Van Helmont himself identi\u0002ed his universal salt, termed the \u201chungry hermaphroditical salt\u201d as a\nsulphureous acidic salt present in fountains, and described how when\nit was reacted with metals like brass, it created vitriol.150 As Pagel has\nnoted, Van Helmont believed that\nsalty sea water percolating into the earth, loses its salt . . . the water then\nassumes at appropriate places the semina of indigenous salt, mineral\nor metal. Thus, out of water grow saltpeter, alum, vitriol and sea-salt.\nThese form a primitive mineral juice, the bur, which is the germ-cell of\nindividual metals and minerals. The latter grow to maturity when there\nis not further in\u0003ux of water.151\nWhether it was due to his belief that metals grew in mines fed by water,\nor to Van Helmont\u2019s ideas, sal mirabile\u2019s watry medium of transport\nrather than air (as nitre was transmitted) may have made it an attractive\nchoice for Glauber when deciding upon the identity of his philosophical salt.\n148\nWorks of Glauber, Part one, p. 266.\nWilliam R.

While\nhe acknowledges the important of nitre as expressed in earlier authors\nlike Duchesne and Paracelsus, he postulates its power was expressed for\nnew purposes\u2014namely the Helmontian alkahest. Whereas Duchesne\nacknowledges the role of salts in color and taste, it is via its ability\nas an alkahest that nitre is able to manifest these physical changes in\nGlauber\u2019s works. Glauber\u2019s use of a sulphuric compound as his universal\nsalt brings together in\u0003uences from mining authors like Agricola and\nthe \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur,\u2019 as well as the new emphasis on water in the work of\nVan Helmont, who as we will see in the next chapter, also had great\nin\u0003uence in forming conceptions of salts among English chymists in\nthe early Royal Society.\n\nPages 64:\nCHAPTER THREE\nVAN HELMONT, SALTS, AND NATURAL HISTORY IN\nEARLY MODERN ENGLAND\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the in\u0002uence of Paracelsian ideas\nin salt chymistry in English works was profound in the \u0003rst half of the\nseventeenth century, as the tria prima of Paracelsus gave salt a central\nrole in matter theory. However, we have also demonstrated that Johann\nGlauber, whose work was known to members of the Hartlib circle,\nwas in\u0002uenced by the work of Van Helmont, most speci\u0003cally in his\nconcept of the alkahest and in water as a method of transport for his\nsal mirabile. Certainly, the realization that Van Helmont was crucial to\nthe development of early modern chymistry in the latter half of the\nseventeenth century, particularly in the work of Robert Boyle, has been\ncogently demonstrated by Principe and Newman.1 In the case of saline\nchymistry in the early Royal Society however, it would be a mistake to\nlimit ourselves to a story of Van Helmont as interpreted by Boyle; nor\nwere all of Van Helmont\u2019s ideas utilized for purely chymical or iatrochymical studies. Royal Society \u0003gures such as Martin Lister, Robert\nMoray, and Nehemiah Grew interpreted Van Helmont\u2019s chymical work\nquite independently of Boyle for the purposes of their own work in\nnatural history, a topic to which this chapter will be devoted after a brief\ncontextual analysis of the role of salts in Helmontian chymistry.\nVan Helmont\u2019s theories of the elements and of salt differed greatly\nfrom those of Paracelsus. First, Van Helmont believed that water and\nair were the only true elements. In his Paradoxes, Van Helmont explained\nhis theory of the interrelationship of elements and principles. \u201cthere\nare Originally two onely Elements in the Universe, to wit, the Air, and\nthe Water; which are suf\u0003ciently insinuated from the sacred Text, by the\nSpirit swimming upon the Abysse or greet Deep or Waters, in the \u0003rst\n1\nWilliam R.

Like Erastus, he\nbelieved that heat created new compounds rather than revealing the\nbuilding blocks of a substance; \u201csalt, sulphur and mercury were thus\nnot true principles, but were produced by the heat of analysis.\u201d5\nFor Van Helmont, salts in particular were \u201coffspring of the waters,\u201d\nand if exposed to the Sun, \u201care made aiery and vapoury Ef\u0002uxes,\nrushing into water with a hastened Violence.\u201d6 In other words, some\nsalts could be powerfully volatile. Volatile salts referred to salts that\ngave off an aeriform component (such as an odor), but also to salts that\ndecomposed easily on heating. Boyle\u2019s de\u0003nition of volatile was even\nmore speci\u0003c; he believed the corpuscular bits of volatile matter had to\nbe \u201cvery small\u201d so they are more \u201ceasily put into motion by the action of\nthe Fire and other agents.\u201d7 The speci\u0003c volatile salts that van Helmont,\nand subsequently Boyle had in mind were most likely ammonium\ncarbonate, and ammonium chloride known as sal ammoniac or a\nvolatile alkali.8 Fixed salts referred to salts with a degree of solidity of\na substance as measured by the ability of that substance to resist the\naction of \u0003re, those which were nonvolatile; an example is potassium\ncarbonate which is noncombustible. Not surprisingly, Boyle classi\u0003ed\n\u0003xed substances as being composed of large or \u201cgross\u201d particles which\nwould be \u201ctoo unwieldy and unapt to be carried up into the Air by\n2\nJ.B.

In his\nanalysis of the chymistry of the blood, he claimed that venous blood,\nhaving given nourishment to the organs of the body, was made volatile\nand converted into gas which was breathed out.10 This conversion of\nthe venous blood into breath was thus done chemically, and concerned\nwith the production of \u0003xed and volatile salts. The historian Walter\nPagel further explains van Helmont\u2019s theories of blood chymistry:\nFixed salt is alkali; its particles are stable and form a deposit when a\nsubstance containing it is lique\u0003ed by heat. In settling down, it \u201csnatches\u201d\nparticles of less subtle nature\u2014so called sulphurous particles\u2014which are\nincorporated in the deposit. The \u0003xed salt being unable to \u0003x all the sulphur particles, the rest, which have escaped being snatched, follow their\nnatural tendency to become volatile and in their turn force some of the\nsalt to evaporate with them. Thus, volatile salt is generated. When heated\nin an open vessel all salt contained in the substance evaporates. This is\nwhat happens to the . . . [venous] blood in the . . . lung, that is where it\nis in contact with the air. All its salt has become volatile whereby it is\ndisposable by the breath.11\nClericuzio has in turn shown that \u201cEnglish Helmontians based their\nphysiological theories on the notion of vital spirits, which they conceived as a volatile alkaline salt.\u201d12 Physicians such as Francis Glisson\n(1597\u20131677), Walter Charleton (1619\u20131707), and Thomas Willis (1621\u2013\n1675) all believed this spirit was particulate, having \u201cspeci\u0003c chemical\nproperties;\u201d Willis for instance saw a \u201cvolatile salt, produced by the\naction of a local ferment situated in the brain, as the actual matter of\nanimal spirits.\u201d13 Frank has also demonstrated that William Harvey and\n9\nRobert Boyle, Experimental Notes of the Mechanical Origins or Production of Fixtness\n(Oxford: E.

Coxe claimed:\n\u201c. . . the Air, which is as I could fully demonstrate, [is] impregnated with\na Volatil Salt . . . partly expired from Animals during their life.\u201d16 Just\nas van Helmont thought that heated blood discharged its volatile salts\ninto the air, Coxe also believed that the release of volatile salt in the\nair was due to \u201cSubterraneous . . . and Coelestial Fires\u201d and that these\nSalts, \u201cbeing received into the vast subtile \u0002uid Expanse . . . become\nthe Instrument of sundry remarkable effects and operations, not only\nin Natural, but also Arti\u0003cial productions.\u201d17\n14\nR.G.

Most of Coxe\u2019s experiments had to do with palingenics, or the \u201cresurrection of plants, and the chemical method of achieving their\nastral appearance after destruction.\u201d Coxe took a plant, bruised it, burnt it, collected\nits ashes, and, in the process of calcination, extracted from it a volatile salt. He then\nmade a compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat, and there gradually arose from the ashes, salt crystals which resembled a stem, leaves and \u0002owers; or,\nin other words, an apparition of the plant which had been submitted to combustion.\nInformation on palingenics for this note was taken from Lewis Spence, Encyclopedia of\nOccultism (New Hyde Park, NY: University Books, 1968), s.v. \u201cpalingenics.\u201d\n17\nCoxe, \u201cA Continuation of Dr. Daniel Coxe\u2019s Discourse,\u201d p. 172.\n\nPages 68:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n51\nMany of these remarkable effects that salt produced in the atmosphere\nwere relevant to \u0003elds of natural history, as well as meteorology, both\npredominant \u0003elds of study for the early Royal Society. Natural history was a disciplinal mainstay of the Baconian program of deductive\nempiricism from which the Royal Society claimed was its methodological basis. Michael Hunter, as well as scholars studying early museums,\nincluding the Royal Society\u2019s own collections and the Ashmolean,\nhas illustrated the importance of natural history to the early modern\nscienti\u0003c program.18 Figures such Nehemiah Grew contributed work\nin botany, and Martin Lister wrote about spa waters and conchology.\nRobert Boyle and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Daniel Coxe, described as \u201chaving the\nrole of Boyle\u2019s alter ego\u201d were also heavily involved in researching salt\nchymistry in the latter part of the seventeenth century, analyzing role\nof the salts in spa waters, as well as physiology, and iatrochymistry.19 As\nevidenced by the Royal Society Transactions, weather keeping was also a\npursuit that occupied many fellows such as Robert Moray (1608\u20131673)\nand Edmond Halley (1656\u20131742), and Jankovic has shown how meteorology was crucial to the society\u2019s Baconian research program.20 Because\nHarold Cook has characterized chemistry as the \u201cbasic analytical tool\u201d\nfor seventeenth-century investigators of anatomy and natural history, it\nseems an understanding of his chemical theories and their intellectual\ncontext will shed further light on their natural history work.21 In all of\nthese pursuits, salt chymistry played a signi\u0003cant role.\n18\nPeter Dear, \u201cTotius en Verba: Rhetoric and Authority in the Early Royal Society,\u201d Isis\n76, 2 ( June 1985), pp. 144\u201361; Michael Hunter, Science and Society in Restoration England\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981); Arthur Macgregor, The Ashmolean\nMuseum: A History of the Museum and its collection (Oxford: Ashmolean Museum, 2001);\nMarjorie Swann, Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England\n(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).\n19\nAntonio Clericuzio, Elements, Principles, and Corpuscles: A Study of Atomism and Chymistry\nin the Seventeenth Century (Dordrecht and Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001),\np. 161.

In seventeenth-century England, the\ncauses of planetary beams were considered \u201coccult,\u201d an Aristotelian\nand early modern term utilized when distinguishing \u201cqualities which\nwere evident to the senses from those which were hidden.\u201d22 After the\nRestoration, natural philosophers attempted to \u201crid the world of occult\ncauses and to explain invisible forces like solar and lunar emanations\u201d\nvia the mechanical philosophy, matter-theory, and chemical systems.23\nThis examination of occult causes extended to the tides, or the effects\nof the sunshine and moonbeams upon the seas.\nScholarly analysis of seventeenth-century tidal theories has primarily focused on Galilean, Cartesian, and Keplerian ideas, or upon the\norigins of Wallis\u2019 and Newton\u2019s gravitational models.24 Tidal theory in\n1450\u20131800, ed.

However, Thomas was best known as a \u201ctolerable poet\u201d\nwhile a student at Cambridge University and as an author of tracts on\na variety of subjects ranging from suicide, Aesop\u2019s Fables, to the history of\nheraldry.29\nBy the 1670s, Thomas Philipot\u2019s interests had shifted to natural\nphilosophy, and in 1673, he published A Phylosophical Essay, Treating of\nthe most Probable Cause of that Grand Mystery of Nature, the Flux and Re\u0003ux:\nor Flowing and Ebbing of the Sea.30 Through an extended chain of logical deduction, the majority of his treatise was devoted to a systematic\nconsideration and rejection of the myriad of pre-Newtonian theories\nof the tides, including those of Galileo and Kepler, and a synopsis of\nthe state of tidal research that included both English and continental\nworks. Philipot defended his choice to spend so much time summarizing theories, explaining that tidal models were so \u201centwin\u2019d and\ncomplicated . . . that it is a greater Dif\u0003culty to trace out and unravell\nthem, than to Subvert, or Dismantle them.\u201d31 In the last pages of this\nwork, however, Philipot made his own contribution, and proposed\na theory of the tides based on chymical reactions of sea salts and\natmospheric pressure caused by the emanations of the sun and the\nmoon on the seas.32 As Antonio Clericuzio and Allen Debus have illustrated, by the 1670s and 1680s, English scientists such as John Webster,\nThomas Sherley, and William Simpson blended the iatrochymistry of\nphysician Joan Baptista van Helmont with chemist Robert Boyle\u2019s corpuscularianism and the mechanical philosophy, applying the results to\n28\nDictionary of National Biography, 1937\u201339 ed., s.v. \u201cThomas Philipot,\u201d and s.v.\n\u201cJohn Philipot.\u201d\n29\nFor an analysis of Thomas Philipot\u2019s meditative poems, see Wolfgang Lottes, \u201c \u2018On\nthis Couch of tears\u2019: Meditationen in schwerer Krankheit von Donne, Wotton, Latewar, Isham\nund Philipot,\u201d Literatur in Wissenschaft und Unterricht, 8 (1975), pp. 56\u201371; According to\nthe DNB entry, Thomas Philipot plagiarized his father\u2019s Villare cantianum, or, Kent surveyed\nand illustrated (London: William Godbid, 1659); Thomas Philipot, Poems (London: R.A.,\n1646); Thomas Philipot, Aesop\u2019s fables, with his life: in English, French &amp; Latin (London:\nWilliam Godbid, 1666); Thomas Philipot, Self-homicide-murther, or, Some antidotes and arguments (London: W.

Iatrochymistry is a medical theory, \u0003rst associated with Paracelsus, that disease\nresults from a chemical reaction and that it can be both de\u0003ned and treated chemically. Corpuscularianism was Boyle\u2019s physical theory that supposed all matter to be\ncomposed of minute particles.\n34\nThomas Philipot, The original and growth of the Spanish monarchy united with the House\nof Austria (London: W.G., 1664); Thomas Philipot, A Historical discourse of the \u0002rst invention\nof navigation and the additional improvements of it with the probable causes of the variation of the\ncompasse (London: W. Godbid, 1661).\n35\nPhilipot, Navigation, p. 11.\n36\nPhilipot, Navigation, p. 11.\n37\nGilbert in his De Mundo Nostro Sublunari did however differ from Philipot\u2019s conclusion that the tides were caused by both the sun and the moon; Gilbert believed that\ntides were produced by the magnetic force between the earth and the moon, and not\nby its rays or light. He also \u201cdid not understand how the ebbing of the tide followed\n\nPages 73:\n56\nchapter three\nwas the tides. If we now turn to Philipot\u2019s Phylosophical Essay, we see\nPhilipot believed the \u0002ux of the sea was due to the fact:\nthere is a vitriolated, volatile or armoniack salt or spirit, that is wrap\u2019d\nup in the Bowels of the Sea and lies there clasped up and Imprison\u2019d\nin the Embraces of the \u0003xed . . . Salt, which upon its Excitation, by the\nAgitation of the Super\u0003cies of the Sea, and the opening of it by the\ncombined and complicated Impressions of the Sun and Moon, dislodges\nfrom its Inclose, and shoots it self up to the watry Margent, and drags\nalong with it, that Heap of Waters we stile the Flux.38\nJust as van Helmont believed heated blood in contact with air discharged\nits volatile salts and became breath or gas that was released into the\natmosphere, Philipot may have analogized that volatile salts were\nfreed from the \u0003xed sea salt via motion of the waves and the heated\nemanations of the sun and moon. The volatile salts were subsequently\nreleased into the air, and their motion and expansion caused the \u0002ux\nof the tides.39\nTo explain the re\u0002ux of the waters, Philipot also utilized the explanation of what he called the \u201cspring of the air\u201d which was Boyle\u2019s term\nfor atmospheric pressure. A connection between atmospheric pressure\nand planetary ef\u0002uviums was indeed proposed by Boyle, who speculated\nthat the Gravity of the Atmosphere\nmay be alter\u2019d by unseen Ef\u0002uviums . . . [as] we have often perceived by\nthe Mercurial Baroscope the Weight of the Air to be noticably increased,\nwhen we could not perceive in the Air . . . any cause to which we could\nascribe so noticeable a change.40\nBoyle thought perhaps that even \u201cthe Sun it self may not now and\nthen alter the Gravity of the Atmosphere otherwise than by its Beams\nfrom the direct attraction unless the interior of the earth contained humors which\nretreated into the earth when the tidal forces ceased, and so caused the surface of\nthe sea to descend. He also did not understand why the earth and moon did not fall\ntogether.\u201d See Harris, Manual of Tides, 398; William Gilbert, De Mundo nostro Sublunari\n(Amsterdam: Elzevir, 1651), pp. 298\u201399.\n38\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 11.\n39\nThe expansion of the volatile salts to cause the \u0002ux of the sea was similar in\nmechanism to the ability of volatile salts to agitate the animal spirits of the body.\nEnglish Helmontians in fact often \u201cadministered volatile alkaline salts distilled from\nblood to agitate restore the weakened vital spirits or archaeus of the body\u201d by their\nexpansion. Boyle himself attempted to distill the spirit of blood, which he believed was\n\u201cfully satiated with saline and spiritous parts,\u201d and thus had the therapeutic ability to\nrestore the vital spirits. See Roos, \u201cLuminaries in Medicine,\u201d pp. 453\u201354.\n40\nBoyle, Suspicions about some hidden qualities in the air, p. 45.\n\nPages 74:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n57\nor heat.\u201d41 Via a similar mechanism, Philipot proposed that the air\n\u201cascended up\u201d with the sea\u2019s \u0002ux, and \u201cupon closing and contracting\nits Face upon the Recess of those two great Luminaries, shrinks back\nagain, and with it pulls along, that mass of waters it before had elevated,\nand this produces the Re\u0002ux.\u201d42 In other words the atmospheric pressure of the sun and moon \u201cpushed back\u201d the air that had risen with\nthe \u0002ow of the tides, leading to the tides\u2019 ebb.\nTo further support his hypotheses, Philipot cited Jesuit authors such\nas Libertus Froidmont (1587\u20131653) and the polymath Athanasius\nKircher (1601/2\u20131680). Froidmont was a professor at Leuven, and\na Latin edition of his Six Books of Meteors was published at Oxford in\n1639.43 A good proportion of the \u0003fth book was devoted to considering\nsystematically hypotheses of the tides, each submitted to questiones and\ndisputationes in scholastic fashion. Philipot in fact seems to have utilized\nFroidmont\u2019s structure of argumentation and some of his content in\nthe beginning of this Phylosophical Essay when he considered other tidal\nmodels. To support his idea of chemical reactions in the air causing the\nmotion of \u0002uids, Philipot in particular cited Froidmont\u2019s observation\nof an experiment done by the Swiss physician and philologist Jacob\nZwinger (1569\u20131610). Zwinger noticed that oil of vitriol ascended\nand descended with the \u0002ux and re\u0002ux of the sea.44 Because oil of\nvitriol is extremely reactive and hygroscopic (it absorbs water), it is\nlikely Zwinger was noticing water absorption during periods of higher\nhumidity.45 Philipot then connected lunar action to saline chymistry by\n41\nBoyle, Suspicions about some hidden qualities in the air, p. 45.\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 12.\n43\nLiberti Fromondi, Meteorologicorum Libri Sex (Oxford: William Turner, 1639).\n44\nLiberti Fromondi, Meteorologicorum Libri Sex (Oxford: William Turner, 1639), p. 321.\nScribit alibudi Swingerus, oleum quoddam vitreoli esse, quod tumescit cum Luna &amp; detumescit: quid si\nigitur similis substantaie, aut qualitatis, id est, vitriolatae, ut loquuntur nostri Chymici, spritium marini\nalvei fundus obtineat? [Swingerus writes somewhere of the oil of vitriol which exists, that\nswells and shrinks with the moon. Therefore, what is this quality of vitriol, of which\nour chemists speak, which is similar to the spirit of the sea and tides? (my translation)].\nFroidmont\u2019s source was Jacob Zwinger, Principiorum chymicorum examen ad generalem Hippocratis, Galeni, caeterorumque . . . (Basil: Sebastian Henricpetri, 1620). Jacob Zwinger was\ninterested in salts, like his father, Theodore Zwinger, and \u201csought to \u0003nd the elements\nthat were valuable in Paracelsian doctrine and extract them\u201d including Paracelsus\u2019\ndoctrine of the tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury. See Jole Shackelford, \u201cLutheran\nOrthodoxy, and the Rejection of Paracelsianism in Early Seventeenth-Century Denmark,\u201d Bulletin of the History of Medicine 70 (1996), pp. 181\u2013204, on p. 182. My thanks\nto Dr. Shackelford for providing me with information about Jacob Zwinger.\n45\nBoyle also noted that vitriolic substances were particularly susceptible to atmospheric moisture; adding water to oil of vitriol or sulphuric acid in fact will result in\n42\n\nPages 75:\n58\nchapter three\nciting Kircher\u2019s Mundus Subterraneus (1665). Kircher recorded that an\ninfusion of the volatile salt, sal armoniack, \u201cplaced obliquely to receive\nthe In\u0002uence of the Moon . . . did Increase and Decrease as it held of\nan equal Correspondence, by an uninterrupted Chain of Atoms, with\nthe Flowings and Ebings of the Marine waters.\u201d46 (Sal ammoniac or\nammonium chloride is similarly hydroscopic and reacts to atmospheric\nhumidity, which may have been behind Kircher\u2019s observations of its\nincrease and decrease with the tides).47\nPhilipot also seemed to be unaware of the fact that in 1665, members\nof the Royal Society were privately testing Kircher\u2019s hypotheses. In a\nletter from Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the Society, to the writer,\nchemist, and mathematician Robert Moray, Oldenburg stated:\nKircher produces severall Experiments to evince, yt ye Moon is ye sole\ncause of those Sea-reciprocations, by a Nitrous quality and Dilating\nfaculty. . . . etc. it be experimented, if it hath not been by any of our\nOxonian friends, whether Nitrous water, mixed with common salt, exposed\nin a bason to ye Beams of ye Moon in a free open place and a cleer\nMoonshiny night, will boyle and bubble up, and ye more vehemently,\nye neerer the two Luminaries are to ye places of their Conjunction and\nOpposition.48\nFour days later, Robert Boyle commented that Moray \u201chas been here to\nwatch ye successe of ye Expt of Kerker yt you sent him concerning ye\nEbbing and \u0002owing of ye sea.\u201d49 As Stevenson has shown, Moray had\nin fact written a series of letters to Kircher about magnetism and tides\nfrom 1643 to 1646, as well as in 1653, one of which about the tides\nof the Hebrides that Kircher reprinted in the Mundus Subterraneous and\na dangerous explosive reaction.

Philipot is referring to Athanasius Kircher,\nMundus Subterraneus, in XII libros digestus (Amsterdam: J. Janson, 1665). The original work\nwas published in 1665, and a partial English translation was published in London in\n1669 which Philipot may have used. See Athanasius Kircher, The vulcano\u2019s, or Burning\nand \u0002re-vomiting mountains . . . collected for the most part out of Kircher\u2019s Subterraneous world\n(London: J. Darby, 1669).\n47\nRobert Boyle also noted how a solution of sal ammoniac and water gained\nweight when exposed to the air \u201camounting to near a dram.\u201d See Robert Boyle, A\nNew Experiment . . . of the Ef\u0002cacy of the Air\u2019s Moisture, pp. 6\u20137.\n48\nHenry Oldenburg to Sir Robert Moray. 7 November 1665, in The Correspondence of\nHenry Oldenburg, ed. and trans.

The trueth is, that is one\nof the sciences I \u0003nd most imperfect. I have lent a list to Kircherus,\nwhom I have encouraged to labour to perfect it. And when all other\nmore necessary and serious conversation is almost reaped and we have\nclattered our bellyfulls at meeting, a \u0003tt of that science may take us up\nan afternoon or two.51\nBut Moray was to be disappointed with these \u201c\u0003tts\u201d of science in a\nnumber of ways.\nAs Stevenson wrote,\nIn 1665 [ Moray] heard that long-awaited work on tides by Athanasius\nKircher had been published. From Oxford he wrote to Henry Oldenburg,\n(1618\u20131677) the secretary of the Royal Society, asking to check in the\nbook to see \u2018to see if the irregular tides in the West Isles of Scotland\nbe there.\u2019 Oldenburg\u2019s reply brought good news and bad. Yes, Kircher\nhad published Moray\u2019s letter. But he had dismissed his observations to\n50\nLettere di Sir Robert Moray nel Carteggio A.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a summary of pages 58 to 77:

The text continues to explore the role of salts in early modern natural philosophy and chymistry. This section focuses on <strong>Johann Glauber</strong> (1604–1670) and his theories on <strong>sal mirabile</strong> (sodium sulphate or Glauber’s salt), which he believed was instrumental in the creation of minerals and metals. Glauber’s ideas were influenced by <strong>Paracelsian concepts</strong>, which connected salts with sulphur and mercury.

- Glauber&#x27;s <strong>sal mirabile</strong> was not merely a dissolvent but a substance with the potential to generate matter, especially metals. Glauber postulated that this process mimicked natural mineral and metal formation through sulphurous salts [Glauber, *Philosophical Furnaces*, 1651, p. 55](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=55).
- Glauber’s failure to create the universal solvent, or <strong>alkahest</strong>, led him to focus more on the <strong>mineral-forming capabilities</strong> of his salts, which he believed were critical for both medicine and alchemical processes.
- Glauber’s work emphasized the relationship between sulphurous substances and the maturation of metals, and he discussed how improperly matured minerals could be destroyed or &quot;pulled back by the stars&quot; if exposed too soon to air or water.

This section also discusses how Glauber’s theories were viewed by his contemporaries, some of whom dismissed him as a <strong>mountebank</strong> or charlatan.

The solid glass\nobject had a bulbous end which tapered into a curved glass tail, and\nthese objects exhibited unusual properties of strength and fragility. The\nformation of the drops created tremendous stress between the outside\nlayer, cooled by the water, and the inside which was warm; due to the\ntremendous surface tension of the glass, the head withstood hammering\non an anvil.58 However, breaking the tail resulted in the shattering of\nthe entire drop into \u0003ne powder because the glass released the internal\nstress with such power.59 These drops were utilized in practical jokes\nby Charles II; the King would have a subject hold the bulb end in the\npalm of his hand, and then break off the top, giving the victim a small\nbut harmless explosion in a closed hand.60 Indeed, Philipot referred to\nthese drops as \u201cGreatricks [great-tricks] glasses.\u201d61\nAs with the tides, there was a multiplicity of interpretations of the\nphenomenon, already correctly grasped in principle by Robert Hooke in\nhis Micrographia.62 Philipot however believed the drops shattered because\nof a chemical reaction. When the tail was snapped off,\n57\nThe diarist Samuel Pepys stated he was \u0003rst shown the drops or \u201cchymical\nglasses,\u201d which he had \u201cheard talk of \u201d by Peter Honywood on 13 January 1662.\nHe wrote the glasses \u201cbreak all to dust by breaking off a little small end, which is a\n\u201cgreat mystery.\u201d See the Diary of Samuel Pepys, ed.

He realized that one of the major obstacles to\nthe formulation of mechanical or chemical tidal theories was to \u0003nd an\nexplanation for the fact that smaller bodies of water such as the \u201cEuxine, Baltick, and Caspian Seas\u201d do not exhibit tidal behavior.64 (Many\ninland seas are virtually tideless because the entering strait is too narrow to allow the in\u0002ux or out\u0002ow of suf\u0003cient tidal waters).65 Philipot\u2019s\nexplanation was that rivers \u201cperpetually disgorge themselves into those\nSeas above said,\u201d emptying \u0003xed salts from underground caverns and\nmines, where minerals and salts were generated by mother earth.66 As\na result, the volatile salts in these seas were \u201ccheck\u2019d and depress\u2019d\u201d by\n\u0003xed salts of sulphur, nitre, and bitumen.67 And, so \u201cbenumb\u2019d\u201d were\nthe volatile salts that it was \u201cimpossible for the united In\u0002uence of the\nSun and Moon, to excite their so stupi\u0003ed vigour.\u201d68 Philipot may have\nbeen in\u0002uenced in his ideas again by Froidmont, who immediately\n64\nPhilipot, Phylosophical Essay, p. 13. \u201cEuxine\u201d or \u201cEuxinic\u201d refers to areas in which\nlimited circulation of water has produced stagnant conditions, leading to deposit of\nblack oil shale.

See Ramiz Mamedov, \u201cOn the Level: The continuing\nproblem of the Caspian,\u201d in The Caspian Times, www.caspiantimes.com, p. 4.

Although there have been no analyses of Lister\u2019s works\non spas, there have been many studies of early modern English debates concerning\nthe chemistry of hot springs as well as their economic impact. For instance, the most\nfamous seventeenth-century medical debate was that engendered by Dr. Robert Wittie\u2019s\n(1613?\u20131684) Scarborough spaw (1660) a work in which he advocated the mineral waters\nat Scarborough as a cure-all; his claim was challenged by other physicians such as William Simpson (\u0002. 1665\u20131677) and after a series of dueling pamphlets, the controversy,\nwhich essentially centered around Galenic vs. Paracelsian medical cures, was carried\nout in the Philosophical Transactions.

As we have seen in\nthe last chapter, some chymists claimed that there was a \u201chermaphroditical\u201d or formative salt believed to be responsible for minerallogenesis\nand other types of matter formation, and there were contenders for the\nidentity of this salt including nitre and vitriol. The vitriolic liquid or spirit\nof vitriol (sulphuric acid) called \u2018gur\u2019 or \u2018bur\u2019 was believed by Glauber and\nother early modern mining authors to be a sign of the presence of mineral ores, \u201cwith which sulphurous exhalations were also associated.\u201d83\nWhile Lister agreed with his colleagues about the composition of vitriol,\nwe will see that he dismissed the idea that vitriol was the universal acid\nsalt responsible for mineral formation. Lister also disagreed that there\nwas any particular sole active element responsible for mineral formation, arguing in particular against Van Helmont who assigned water\nthat role. To support his assertions against Van Helmont, we will see\nthat Lister incorporated the empirical work of early modern chemists\nin the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, speci\u0003cally utilizing the Observations on the Mineral Waters of France (1684) written by their chief chemist\nSamuel Du Clos (d. 1715).\nAs these Helmontian aqueous theories of mineral formation arose in\nthe seventeenth century, other chemical authors held \u201cmineral exhalations as an explanation for the generation of . . . minerals and of the\nvaporous ef\u0002uxes thought to issue from ore-deposits.\u201d84 Lister was one\nof these authors, believing that the volatile exhalations of pyrites and its\nvitriol in the air were important in the transformation of matter, and he\nsubscribed to the sixteenth and seventeenth-century theory of witterung\nor ore exhalations as an explanation for the formation of minerals.85\nScratching or crushing pyrites does result in a sulphurous smell, and\nLister claimed pyrites and its vitriol gave off a \u201cwarm vapour\u201d that\nwas \u201clargely sulphurous, pungent, and in\u0002ammable,\u201d identifying vitriol\nas volatile.86 Despite his allegiance to the theories of witterung, we will\nillustrate that Lister made use of his interests in natural history to go\none step beyond them, postulating that the sulphurous exhalations from\npyrites were responsible for the heating of hot springs, and meteorological and geological effects.\n83\nEmerton, Scienti\u0002c Reinterpretation, p. 217.\nJohn A.

Lister may have taken his cue from Bath physician\nEdward Jorden (1569\u20131632) who \u201cstrongly advocated the examination\nof their crystals\u201d to identify dissolved minerals in spas; Dr. Tancred\nRobinson (1657\u20131748) and John Ray, Lister\u2019s colleagues, also remarked\nin correspondence that Anton von Leeuwenhoek also \u201chath observed a\ngreat variety of \u0003gures\u201d in microscopic examination of salts.89 Tancred\nRobinson wrote to Lister concerning the De Fontibus:\nThis afternoon I spent some hours with Mr. Boyle, who gives you his\nmost humble service, and is as proud of your good opinion, as you can\npossibly bee of his; hee hath try\u2019d most of the experiments of your last\nbook, and tells me that hee \u0003nds you a very faithfull and Authentick writer,\nhee shew\u2019d mee this day the severall crystallizations of those salts, which\n87\nWeekly Memorials for the Ingenious (London: Henry Faithorne and John Kersey, 1683/4),\nno. 50, Jan 15, pp. 376\u201382.

As he concentrated on utilizing structure to classify animals\nand insects in his other treatises, it is not surprising he would utilize the\nsame methods in his chemical work [Figure 3]. Because Lister primarily\nused detailed visual observation of crystal structure to classify salts,\nhe cautioned chemists who were deceived by impure water samples in\nwhich there was \u201cconjunction of several pure primary salts, from which\nconfusion arises regarding the true and natural shape of crystals.\u201d91\nAfter his classi\u0003cation of common salts, Lister turned to an analysis\nof salts in English mineral waters, and concluded from isolation by\ndehydration and crystal analysis that only two types were present: nitrum\ncalcarium derived from limestone (calcium carbonate) and common sea\nsalt. Lister thought that the presence of sea salts in English mineral\nsprings was easily explained via the runoff of sea water inland. But nitre\nof lime or what he called nitrum calcarium was a different case. Lister\ncommented that nitrum calcarium was produced by the exposure of limestone to air. This was \u0003rst because \u201cwhere there is nitre of lime, there\nis always limestone to be found,\u201d and because Lister observed that\nno salt whatever grows from limestone immediately after it has been slaked\nby the application of heat, but the same stone produces an abundance of\nsalt, whether it [i.e. the stone] has been untreated or heated, whilst forming\nthe walls or roof of some house; it then grows together to form crystals\nof its own kind.92\nMost likely Lister was observing the formation of potassium carbonate or saltpetre crystals on walls that had been whitened by limestone,\nsimilar to the formation of nitre crystals in limestone saltpeter caves.\nLister noted that nitrum calcarium could also not be formed by steeping\nlimestone in water, and indeed nitrate crystals will not form in areas\nof excess humidity.\n90\nMS Lister 34, Bodleian Library, Oxford University, London April 12, 1683.

Unlike his predecessor Van Helmont,\nor Johann Glauber, Lister was particularly keen to demonstrate, that\nlike limestone salts, vitriol could only form via the exposure of pyrites\nto air\u2014that nitre of lime was produced \u201cone and the same way as\nvitriol.\u201d93 Lister wrote:\nThe creation of vitriol makes the whole matter clear. Its \u0003rst eruption\nfrom pyrites is exceedingly premature, if it occurs in contact with air;\nbut, as time proceeds, it becomes a little more mature. And yet fullyformed vitriol is not produced from any ferrous stone until after its due\nmaturity which it \u0003nally reaches after a continuous period of development. If however it [a pyrite] kept perpetually under water I am not\nyet convinced that it will be productive of any salt. Certainly no vitriol\nwhatever will be generated.94\nIn his assertion, Lister wished to not only to prove the ef\u0003cacy of air or\nexhalations as the source of chemical reactions and effects for reasons\nwhich will be enumerated below, but argued against the Helmontian\nbelief that vitriol and its acid, the \u201chungry\u201d or \u201chermaphroditical salt\u201d\nwas the \u201cseminal constituent of mineral waters and metal ores.\u201d95 Lister\n\u0003rst cited Helmont\u2019s Oriatricke or Physick Re\u0002ned which stated that \u201cthe\nmost excellent Vitriol, grows naturally in Mines, wherein Nature hath\nbrought forth that hungry Salt, corroding a fertile vein [of brassy marcasite] and being dissolved in the liquor of a licking Fountain, which\nafterward Cauldrons do boyl into Vitriol.\u201d96 Lister then continued, \u201cI\nam unhappy with Helmontius\u2019 explanation of the generation of vitriol.\nHe would have it that salt is formed naturally in water itself, this salt\nbeing variously known as \u2018juice,\u2019 \u2018a certain universal spirit,\u2019 \u2018the embryonate,\u2019 \u2018the corrosive,\u2019 \u2018the hermaphroditic\u2019 (for it is by these and other\n93\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 51.

First, he believed it was \u201cpointless to state\nthat corrosive salt exist[ed] anywhere\u201d since \u201cup to this point it has\nno characteristics and is not even recognizable.\u201d98 His observations of\npyrites indicated that no vitriol was produced when marcasites were in\nwater.99 Further, Lister did a series of experiments in which he failed to\nsee corrosion when he subjected many types of iron, including hematite,\nthe \u201csoftest\u201d form of iron, to corrosive saline or acidic solutions such\nas aqua fortis or spirit of nitre.100\nHis refutation of Helmont\u2019s theory that vitriol was formed in water\nwas also in\u0002uenced by the work of French physician-in-ordinary Samuel\nCotreau Du Clos, the Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, which\nwas translated into English in 1684.101 Du Clos\u2019 work was a systematic\nevaluation of the chemical content of all spa waters in France under\nthe auspices of the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, part of a\nlarger project of chemical research which began in 1666 to \u201cdetermine rigorously the \u2018true principles of mixts [chemical compound]\u2019\nby analyzing such bodies and by generating them and observing their\nproperties.\u201d102 Lister had been to France four times; his \u0003rst voyage was\n97\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 57.

Lister\u2019s De Fontibus was also advertised in the endpapers\nof the English edition of Du Clos\u2019 work, leading to the possibility that\nLister was the translator; in the opinion of Lister\u2019s biographer Raymond Stearns, Lister\u2019s French would have certainly been up to the task,\nalthough he had trouble at the French Opera, \u201cnot being so Good a\nFrenchman, as to understand them when Sung.\u201d103 Lister remarked in\nthe De Fontibus that:\nit is not stated that mature vitriol can be drawn from any of our mineral\nsprings as far as I know.

As a practicing physician himself,\nLister would have been interested in such arguments. In 1668\u201369, physician William\nSimpson wrote the Hydrologia Chymica, a work which \u201csought to identify the \u2018cures\u2019\nassociated with a plethora of \u2018Sanative Waters\u2019 in England and Europe\u201d and which\nalso sparked a number of publications about spa waters in the Philosophical Transactions\nby other doctors such as Robert Wittie, Daniel Foot, and Nathaniel Highmore. Simpson\nbelieved the active ingredient in the waters was alum, and while Wittie believed vitriol\nwas \u201cuseful in moist diseases,\u201d its hot and biting nature drying super\u0002uous humidity,\nhe also thought nitre was the principal mineral in the water. (William Simpson, Hydrologia chymica or, The chymical anatomy of the Scarbrough, and other spaws in York-Shire: wherein\nare interspersed, some animadversions upon Dr. Wittie\u2019s lately published treatise of the Scarbrough\nSpaw . . .

One of\nthe fellows of the Royal Society, Daniel Coxe, was especially interested\nin palingenesis, and the production of volatile salts from plants via their\ncalcinations. Given Lister\u2019s interest in botany and chemistry, Oldenburg\nmade special mention of Coxe\u2019s work to Lister in correspondence in\n1674. In a 1673 letter to Oldenburg, Lister himself already was \u201ccon\u0003dent from a passage in Mr. Boile, yt he &amp; others are masters of ye\nway of Extracting ye volatile salts out of all plants\u201d; Lister also mentioned he had been performing such chemical extractions \u201chere this\n12 yeares.\u201d106 Coxe\u2019s work on palingenics and the \u201cplentifull\u201d nature of\npyrite salts in particular also convinced Tancred Robinson that \u201ctheir\nfermentations, breathings, emanations, and changes . . . send[ing] forth\ntheir secret ef\u0002uviums\u201d could produce many \u201cfruitful\u201d effects.107\nFor Lister, one of these effects of these volatile salts in the atmosphere\nwas the production of fossils. Past scholarship has noted the debate that\nLister had with John Ray about the nature of fossils, Ray believing\nthey were remnants of past animal and plant life, and Lister convinced\nthat fossils were not always mineralized remains of living creatures, but\ncould be minerals created spontaneously by nature; as he put it, some\nlittle fossilized shells could \u201cspring from rocks and others are actual\nSeventeenth-Century England,\u201d Medical History 23 (1979): 191\u2013214.

He thus believed\nall fossils contained iron marcasites, proven by running a magnet over\nthem, and that pyrites could be detected in a like manner. Further, in\nDe Fontibus, Lister claimed that \u201ccalcarious nitre, both when it is springing into being and when it is mature, and likewise of . . . imperfectly\nformed vitriol,\u201d is the \u201cunique cause of petri\u0003cation in every case.\u201d109\nVan Helmont argued that in the case of fossils, a petrifying and germinating seed in mineral waters produced shells \u201cclothed in a crust as\na result of rancid material from the depths.\u201d110 But as we have seen,\nLister denied Van Helmont\u2019s belief that water was the source of all\nother matter through the seminal power of speci\u0003c seeds implanted in\nit. Instead, Lister claimed that the seed of fossils, is\npropagated not so much by sexual union [of the seeds] as by the actual\nrancidity from the depths. . . . The layers of rock are produced under the\nearth from rancid stink arising from the rocks. I am not here enquiring\nhow layers of rock are produced, but if we suppose that they have existed\nfrom the creation of the world the question is posed as to the source of\nthe petri\u0003cation of plants, animals and now even the rocks themselves. I\ndeclare that we are generally deceived by what has a similar appearance\nto certain germinating rocks, as though all other kinds of rocks were\nproduced today from one and the same cause as was once the case. Yet\nas far as I have been able to observe everything that petri\u0003es is either\npyrites or some kind of limestone and nothing else. These two petri\u0003ers\nproduced by the continual germination of salt are after their own fashion volatile, and when admitted into intermediary substances, dead as\nwell as alive, they combine and are compacted of their own nature, and\ngenerally even preserve the shapes of the animals, and their qualities, at\nleast to some extent.111\nIn other words, the \u201cstink\u201d coming from the rocks was the sulphureous\nvapour arising from the \u201ccontinual germination\u201d of salts of vitriol from\nthe pyrites and calcarious nitre arising from the limestone. These vola108\nLister, De Fontibus, part two, p. 78. Each of the two parts of Lister\u2019s work is\nseparately paginated.

Just as Glauber believed his sal mirabile, sodium\nsulphate, was involved in the petri\u0003cation of wood, Lister thought\nthat \u201cwhat the vitriol does to the iron is pure petri\u0003cation.\u201d112 Another\nsulphurous compound was responsible for petri\u0003cation of all inorganic\nand organic matter.\nLister also apparently thought there were other \u201cfruitful effects\u201d of\nthe emanations of the vitriolic salts from pyrites, in his De Fontibus\nclaiming these salty emanations were the cause of the heating of\nmineral springs, and the production of rainstorms, earthquakes, and\nvolcanoes. In chapter nine of the De Fontibus, Lister hypothesized \u0003rst\nthat the cause of heat of hot springs was \u201cderived from salts produced\nby pyrites . . . or activated by pyrites itself.\u201d113 As nitrum calcarium was also\nproduced from limestone via exposure to the air, much in the same way\nas vitriolic salts from pyrites, he thought lime salts could also contribute\nheating vapours to hot springs. The abundance of limestone around\npyrite minerals, as well as mists around the springs also led him to this\nconclusion.114\nIn asserting the centrality of pyrites in heating mineral springs, Lister\n\u0003rst claimed that the warm sulphurous gases produced by vitriolic salts\nfrom pyrites was evidenced by mine explosions in which gases would\naccumulate, and the fact that mineshafts and underground tunnels of\nhot springs were \u201cvery warm\u201d in the \u201cwhole of winter.\u201d115 There was\nalso no other substance prevalent around mineral springs that he knew\nof apart from volatile salts from pyrites and limestone that gave off a\n112\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 72.\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 76.

Almost all springs\nand wells (for most of them are considered medicinal to the extent to which they\ncontain this or that salt) are especially warm at times of fairly severe frost, and are\nparticularly noticeable for the way in which they give off an exhalation consisting of\na very dense moist vapour, just like hot springs.\u201d [Halitum quoque calidum a lapide calcario\nVegetante, similiter ferri, sic probo. Universos fere Fontes, puteosque (nam plerique, eatenus medicati\nexistimati sunt, quatenus hoc vel ille sale, copiosius imbuuntur) praecipue vehementioris gelu tempore\ntepidos esse, atque admodum copiose etiam conspicuos, densissimo vapore humido, Thermarum instar,\nhalitus emittere.]\n115\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 77. [Item illud universo consensus testantur Metallarii, puteos subterraneos, tota hyeme, geluque praecipue tempore, admodum tepidos esse.]\n113\n\nPages 95:\n78\nchapter three\ngaseous vapour.116 Lister also believed that in \u201cwet, moist and chilly\nplaces,\u201d the activation of pyrite salts was \u201cparticularly promoted,\u201d\nprobably due to his observation of the increased oxidation of pyrites in\nhumid and oxygen-rich air.117 Lister was likely in\u0002uenced by the early\nmodern concept of \u201cwitterung,\u201d described by Christian Berward in his\nInterpres Phraseologiae Metullarugicae (Frankfurt 1684) as the \u201cvapour or\nexhalation which at times rises out of the earth from rich [ore] veins,\u201d\nespecially at the time of rain storms, and as we have seen, it was associated by Glauber with sulphurous vapors.118 As has been well-established,\nthe early modern period saw an in\u0002ux of German mining engineers\nand entrepreneurs into England; Lister himself referred to Glauber and\nGeorg Agricola extensively in his manuscript and published works.119\nLister\u2019s connection of volatile salts from pyrites and limestone with the\nheating of mineral waters was also in\u0002uenced by the Du Clos\u2019 Observations. In speculating about the effects of spa waters, Du Clos had written\nthat \u201cit may be that some Mineral Vapours or Exhalations do mix with\ncommon Waters . . . and that these Waters are impregnated with their\nQualities, and of some other Volatile Salts not Concrete, elevated in\nthese dry Exhalations of humid Vapours.\u201d120 Du Clos also argued that\n116\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 80. [At praeter Pyriten et lapidem Calcarium nihil, quod scio, halituosum\nemittit vaporem: atque adeo vel ambobus, vel eorum altero iste halitus calefactionis attribuendus est.]\n117\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 83. \u201cIn order to prove that the activation of pyrites . . . involves vapour I shall add to these arguments that in wet, moist and chilly places the\nactivation of those salts is particularly promoted.\u201d [His addo, ut Pyritae &amp; lapidis Calcarii\nvegitationem halituosam esse probem: nimirum, in udis &amp; humidis, algidisque locis Salium eorum\nvegitationem maxime promoveri.]\n118\nChristian Berward, Interpres phraseologi\u00e6\u00e6 metallurgic\u00e6\u00e6.

Burt actually takes issue with traditional historiography that argues that German experts introduced any unknown or\nradically improved techniques for the mining of non-ferrous metallic ores, but he does\nacknowledge they were \u201cworld leaders in the arts of the industry,\u201d and had extensive\ntechnological in\u0002uence in the copper industry. In chapter six of his manuscript, \u201cOn\nthe Method of the History of Iron,\u201d which is devoted to pyrites (pp. 43\u201347), Lister\nrefers repeatedly to Glauber\u2019s A description of new philosophical furnaces, or, A new art of\ndistilling divided into \u0002ve parts: whereunto is added a description of the Tincture of gold or The true\naurum potabile: also the \u0002rst part of the Mineral work, set forth and published for the sakes of them\nthat are studious of the truth (London: T. Williams, 1651).\n120\nDu Clos, Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, p. 4.\n\nPages 96:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n79\nhot springs grew warm speci\u0003cally from hot moist vapours volatilizing\nfrom substances like pyritic vitriol, and not from the substances being\ncombusted themselves.121 Paraphrasing Du Clos, Lister continued in\nthe De Fontibus: \u201cThe water of the hot springs, when placed on a \u0003re,\nalso required the same time to boil as ordinary cold water: from this\nit is clear that the hot springs were not heated by some underground\n\u0003re.\u201d122 Additionally, Lister also cited Du Clos\u2019 conclusion that when\nwater from hot springs was\ntaken into the mouth they do not burn it as much as ordinary water which\nhas been heated over a stove to the same degree of heat. This seems to\nbe due to the thinness of the substance [the exhalations] by which hot\nsprings are heated; just as the \u0002ame produced by brandy does not burn\nthe hand as much as a burning coal placed on it.123\nLister then turned to proving the activation of pyrites in the presence\nof moisture by analyzing their role in the cause of rainstorms. According to the De Fontibus, thunderstorms occurred not only because of\nthe evaporation of the waters by sunlight, but primarily because of a\npartnership between moist vapours engendered by animal and plant\nbreath and sulphurous exhalations from the volatile salts of pyrites\nand limestone.\nTo understand this mechanism of thunderstorms more thoroughly, it\nis necessary to examine what Lister believed about the breath of plants\nand animals. Although the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus\nclaimed that plants only had an insensitive Vegetative soul, and thus only\n121\nDu Clos, Observations on the Mineral Waters of France, pp. 115\u2013116; Lister, De Fontibus, p. 80.\n122\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 81.

Du Clos writes \u201cThat Hot Mineral Waters have no more Disposition to\nBoyl on the Fire than Common Cold Waters, there being as much time requir\u2019d to\ncause the one to boyl as the other. Which clearly shews that the Heat which Mineral\nWaters contract in the Earth, proceeds not from a Motion of their Particles excited\nby any Subterraneous Fire.\u201d\n123\nLister, De Fontibus, 81. [Quod in os sumptae, haud aeque id adurunt, ac aqua communis,\nad eundem claoris gradum igne culinari calefacta: Id quod a materiae tenuitate, a qua Thermae\nincalescunt, oriri videtur; Siquidem Spiritus Vini dicti \u0003amma, manum haud aeque adurit, ac pruna\nei imposita.] Du Clos writes in the Observations: \u201cThat these hot Mineral waters burn\nnot the Mouth and tongue of those who drink of them at their coming forth from\ntheir Springs, as Common Water heated by Fire to a like Degree would do.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 78 to 97, which focus on natural history and early scientific studies of salts and minerals. Here are the main points:

- <strong>Prince Rupert&#x27;s Drops</strong>: Introduced in the 1640s, these teardrop-shaped glass objects were used to demonstrate internal stress in materials. They became a tool for exploring the properties of materials in early natural philosophy [p. 78](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=78).

- <strong>Martin Lister&#x27;s Work</strong>: Lister (1639–1712) was an important figure in natural history. He studied pyrites and vitriol in mineral springs and proposed that volatile salts played a role in the formation of fossils. He challenged earlier theories by <strong>Van Helmont</strong> and <strong>Glauber</strong>, focusing on empirical evidence [p. 83](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=83).

- <strong>Volatile Salts and Fossil Formation</strong>: Lister suggested that fossils formed through a process driven by salts exhaled from minerals, rejecting Van Helmont&#x27;s theory that water was the primary source of fossilization. He linked these ideas to the processes of mineral formation and weather phenomena like thunderstorms [p. 89](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=89).

- <strong>Mineral Waters and Pyrites</strong>: Lister argued that pyrites played a key role in heating mineral springs and producing geological effects like earthquakes and rainstorms. He theorized that sulphurous vapors from pyrites were responsible for these natural phenomena [p. 94](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=94).

This summary provides an in-depth look at how early thinkers explored the connection between salts, minerals, and natural phenomena.

In an essay in the\nPhilosophical Transactions, Lister wrote,\nAmong the known Sea Plants the Sargosse or Lenticula Marina [Sea\nLentil] is not to be forgot; this grows in vast quantities from 36 to 18\ndegrees Northern Latitude, and elsewhere upon the deepest Seas. And I\n128\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 88.\nLister speci\u0003cally cited Dr. Robert Plot\u2019s The Natural History of Oxfordshire, Being\nan Essay toward the natural History of England (Oxford: The Theater, 1677), pp. 254\u20135.\nPlot (1640\u201396), of Magdalen College, Oxford, and Secretary of the Royal Society in\n1682, described it as follows: \u201cHe [Wills] took two glass Vials with narrow necks, each\nholding one pound 8 ounces, and 2 drachms or water . . . into one of these glasses \u0003lled\nwith water, he put a sprig of \u0002ourishing Mint (which before had grown in the water)\nweighing one ounce: the other glass he also \u0003ll\u2019d with water, and exposed them both in\na window to the Sun. After ten days time, he found in the bottle where the mint was,\nonly \u0003ve ounces and four drachms of water remaining, and no more so that there was\none pound two ounces and six drachms spent, the mint weighting scarce two drachms\nmore than at \u0003rst. From the other Glass, where water was put of the same weight,\nand no mint, he found the Sun had exhaled near one ounce of water, and therefore\nconcluded it drew but so much out of the \u0003rst glass, at least no more: So that allowing one ounce for what the Sun had exhaled, there was in those ten days spent by the\nmint, one pound one ounce six drachms of water; and the mint being increased in\nweight only two drachms, \u2018twas plain the mint had purely expired in those two days,\none pound one ounce and four drachms, that is, each day above an ounce and half,\nwhich is more than the weight of the whole mint. Whence he concluded that what\nMalphigius so wonders at in his Book De Bombyce, viz. that those Animals will sometimes eat in one day, more than the weight of their bodies, is out-done by every sprig\nof mint, and most other Herbs in the Field, which every summers day attract more\nnourishment than their own weight amounts too. Which the same ingenious person at\nleast questions not (and therefore wishes trials may be made) of the Tithymali, Esulae,\nand especially of Pinguicula and Ros Solis, which last sucks up moisture faster than the\nSun can exhale it, and is bedewed all over at Noon-day, notwithstanding its power: Nor\ndoubts he but that Wormwood, and all other Plants that are very hot, and of strong\nsmells, expire as much, if not more than the Mint.\u201d All of the plants (except Wormwood) mentioned by Plot produce liquids that could be interpreted as dew. Ros Solis\nwas Drosera rotundifolia, or Sun-Dew, a carnivorous plant noted for its dew on its leaves\nthat intensi\u0003ed with the sun; Pinguicula was known as butterwort, another carnivorous\nplant with mucilage drops on its leaves to catch insects, apparently interpreted by Plot\nas dew. Tithymali and esulae are species of spurge that produces a milky latex from roots\nand stems when injured. For descriptions of these plants, see John Gerard, Herball or\nGeneral Historie of Plantes (1613) (New York: Dover Publications, 1975).\n129\n\nPages 99:\n82\nchapter three\nthink . . . from the daily and constant breath of that Plant, the Trade or\nTropic Winds do in great part arise.130\nHe also hypothesized that plant breath was also primarily moist; Lister\nused as evidence that night dews and mists from springs, rivers, and the\nsea also arose \u201clargely from the condensed breath of plants.\u201d131 And the\nmoisture of plant breath combined with Pyrites created rain. Although\nLister acknowledged that rains were \u201cexhaled as a result of the heat of\nthe Sun\u201d on the ocean, he considered the condensations of the moist\n\u201cvapour both of Pyrites and limestone\u201d found underground in mines\nas well as that from \u201cespecially the vegetation growing on Pyrites and\nlimestone\u201d to be the \u201cgreatest material for rain.\u201d132 Lister further commented that violent rain occurred when the vapour of pyrites and their\nvitriolic salts were mixed\n130\nLister, \u201cCertain Observations,\u201d p. 494. Sea Lentil or Sargasso weed, is a proli\u0003c\nbrown seaweed of the genus Sargassum, and was described in the Philosophical Transactions\nby Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753). This lush plant covers an area of Sargasso Sea that is\nat the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, often having \u0002oating layers 1\u20132 feet thick. The\nplant has small bladders in the form of empty sea pods that allow it to \u0002oat on the\nsea surface \u201cSargasso Sea,\u201d Bermuda-Triangle.org, p. 1, online. http://www.bermudatriangle.org/500_Leagues_of_Sea/Sargasso_Sea /sargasso_sea.html, accessed 9 August\n2002.

Although\nLister seems to be saying the physical breathing of plants causes the trade winds, it\nmay be possible that he thought the volatile salts contained in plant breath may have\nbeen behind the production of winds. Sargasso weed was very salty in taste, which\nalso may have some bearing on Lister\u2019s theory.\n131\nLister, De Fontibus, pp. 87, pp. 89\u201390. In these pages, Lister\u2019s idea that plant breath\nwas responsible for dews led him to consider the use of it for water puri\u0003cation at\nsea, a much-debated problem in the seventeenth-century English navy. Because Lister\nbelieved the condensation of plant breath produced water, he did an experiment in\nwhich he placed sea weed, some with roots, some adhering to stones, in a \u201cglass bodie\u201d;\nthe \u201cglass bodie being full, I put thereon a head with a Beck, and adapted a Receiver\nthereto . . . from these Plants did distill dayly . . . a fresh, very sweet and potable water.\u201d\nAfter urging further experimentation and how his discovery \u201cmay well prove most\ndesirable and useful for sailors,\u201d Lister then went on to speculate that sea water was\nthe only \u201celement of water created\u201d in Genesis before any Animal or Vegetable was\ncreated, or the Sun itself;\u201d over time the \u201cvapours of Plants and the Breath of Animals\nand the Exhalations raised by the Sun\u201d created the fresh water in Rivers.\u201d\n132\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 90. [At forte longe maxima pluviarum material a salibus Metallorum\nsubterraneis, &amp; praecipue Pyritae &amp; lapidis Calcarii vegetantibus oritur.]\n\nPages 100:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n83\nin tiny amounts with some moist vapour, then if at any time and for\nany reason it happens to be set on \u0003re [by lightening or friction] little\ndroplets of water are necessarily forced together and thrown down, when\nthe draught by whose movement and stirring alone they are borne up\ninto the atmosphere is driven away.133\nIn other words, the force of sparked vapor pushed water droplets\ntogether and downwards.\nLister also believed thunder and lightning \u201cowed their matter from\nthe sole [sulphurous] breath of the Pyrites.\u201d134 In the De Fontibus, as\nsupport for his assertions, Lister cited Pliny\u2019s Natural History: \u201cPliny says\nthat thunder and lightening burn with sulphur, and the actual light they\nproduce is sulphurous.\u201d135 Lightning does small of sulphur, sulphur is\nin fact an excellent insulator, and static electricity accumulated on it\ndischarges in electrical sparks towards proximate objects, effects which\nmay have given Lister his idea. Further, in early modern German mining\nliterature, ore exhalations due to witterung were implicated in meteorological effects such as thunder and lightening.136 Referring to an article\nhe wrote in the Philosophical Transactions, Lister also enumerated several\nrecorded instances by Aristotelian scholar Julius Scaliger (1484\u20131558)\nand author of \u201cbooks of secrets\u201d Giordano Cardano (1501\u201376) of \u201cIron\nto have fallen in great masses, and also in powder after the manner of\nrain, out of the Air\u201d indicating by analogy that because iron pyrites\nwere involved in meteor showers, they would be involved in rain showers\nas well.137 Lister then remarked that according to William Gilbert\u2019s De\nMagnete (1600) that presumably these pyrite-rich meteors, which were\n133\nLister, De Fontibus, p. 83.

Hales wrote Vegetable Staticks (1727)\nin which he measured the rate of plant transpiration, so it would not\nbe surprising if he were familiar with Lister\u2019s works.145 As Cohen has\nnoted, the antiquarian and biographer of Newton, Reverend William\nStuckley (1687\u20131785) took notes on some papers presented in the Royal\nSociety in 1752, in which Hales:\ngives an experiment of putting some pyrites stone, with some aqua fortis\n[concentrated nitric acid (HNO3)], into a vessel set in water, and covered\nwith a large glass, whose mouth must be immersed in the water. A brisk\nfermentation arises, a black cloud, and a destruction of some quantity\nof air . . . Then suddenly taking up the glass out of the water, and letting\nin fresh air, a new ebullition arises . . . From this experiment the doctor\napprehends that the cause of earthquakes is much illustrated. He says\nsulphureous vapour arises out of the earth generated probably by the\npyrites abounding therein . . . through cracks and chinks of the gaping\nearth. The vapours \u0002y into the upper regions of the air, where they meet\nwith pure and uncorrupted air, clouds intervening like as in the glass\nreceiver, they ingage with violence . . . through the clouds, and cause a\nprodigious tumult above . . .

Hales indeed would have observed an exothermic reaction (brisk fermentation).\nThe sulphurous vapours he reported were most likely sulphur dioxide produced from\nthe reaction of pyrites with oxygen: 4 FeS2 + 1102 o\u0003 2Fe2O3 + 8 SO2, or just the\nproduction of free sulphur, as enumerated below. The reaction that Hale described was\nlikely (assuming some pyrites were iron-copper pyrites, as he does not distinguish):\nCuFeS2 + 4 HNO3 = Cu(NO3)2 + Fe(NO3)2 + 2 H+ + 2 S(solid) OR in word form:\nIron-copper pyrites + nitric acid = Copper nitrate and iron nitrate and hydrogen\nions with solid sulphur.\n\nPages 103:\n86\nchapter three\nIn a like fashion, Lister also mentioned in an article in the Philosophical\nTransactions that volcanoes were \u201cMountains made up in great part\nof Pyrites\u201d because of the \u201cquantities of Sulphure thence sublimed,\nand the Application of the Load-stone to the ejected Cinder.\u201d147 He\nmay have received this notion from The Vulcanoes (1669), which was an\nEnglish summary of Athanasius Kircher\u2019s Mundus Subterraneous. Kircher\nexplained, \u201csulphureous . . . spirits, which lodged there [in subterranean\ncaves] . . . at length ends in a new food and nourishment of the \u0003re.\u201d148\nKircher also claimed that \u201csulphur . . . insinuated into the pores of the\nCalx [limestone] or Calcined Lime\u201d where it \u201cadministers that perpetual\nand everlasting fuel and food of Fire\u201d; he also speculated that vitriol and\nsal ammoniac might play a role in the production of lava.149 We have seen\nearlier that Lister thought limestone might play a role in concert with\npyrites in producing the heat of hot springs; his concern with \u201ccaukestone,\u201d which he termed \u201ca very odd mineral,\u201d may have been suggested\nby Kircher\u2019s speculations.150 Finally, to answer objections that England\nhad a good quantity of pyrites, but little volcanic activity, Lister claimed\nthat in areas such as Mount Vesuvius experienced more volcanic eruptions because \u201cthe Pyrites of the Vulcano\u2019s or burning Mountains may\nbe more Sulphurious then ours. And indeed it is plain, that some of\nours in England are very lean.\u201d151\nIn the frontispiece of his De Fontibus, Lister included a quote from\nPliny\u2019s Natural History: Tales sunt aquae, qualis terra per quam \u0003uunt, or waters\ntake their nature from the strata through which they \u0002ow. Understanding\nthe chemical nature of the waters subject to the chemical in\u0002uence of\npyrites was indeed crucial for Lister, and subsequent natural philosophers\nto comprehend meteorological and geological change. Despite the \u201cvery\nlean\u201d nature of English pyrites, Lister himself seemed to regard their\ninvestigation as particularly important.

This belief, informed by a reaction to Helmontian chymistry within the Royal Society, characterized the botanical work\nof Nehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712). Grew was botanist and secretary to\nthe Royal Society, has been subject to extensive scholarly analysis, ranging from the patronage required for the publication of his magisterial\nAnatomy of Plants (1682), to his cataloguing of the Royal Society collections, to his philosophy of vitalism.152 However, other than his role in\nthe discovery of Epsom salts and his promotion of nitre for fertilizer,\nhis contributions to chymistry have received less scholarly attention.\nAfter receiving his B.A. from Cambridge in 1661\u20131662, Grew went\nonto receive his medical degree from Leiden, studying under Sylvius\nand writing a dissertation on the liquors of the nervous system, utilizing\nSylvius\u2019 well-known acid-alkali iatrochymistry as the basis for his analysis.153 Grew\u2019s continued devotion to chemical research was applied to his\nbotanical work. As Bolan has shown, in his Anatomy, Grew thought it\nwas necessary to perform \u201ca chemical analysis of the contents of plants\n152\nBrian Garrett, \u201cVitalism and teleology in the natural philosophy of Nehemiah\nGrew (1641\u20131712),\u201d British Journal of the History of Science 36, 1 (March 2003), pp. 63\u201381;\nMichael Hunter, \u201cEarly Problems in Professionalizing Scienti\u0003c Research: Nethemiah\nGrew (1641\u20131712) and the Royal Society, with an unpublished Letter to Henry Oldenburg,\u201d Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London 36, 2 (February 1982), pp. 189\u2013209;\nJeanne Bolam, \u201cThe Botanical Works of Nehemiah Grew, F.R.S.

The idea of preformation of salts\ncontinued to be a prevalent topic in seventeenth-century chymistry.156\nNicholas L\u00e9mery (1645\u20131715), a French corpuscularian and writer of\nthe popular French chemistry textbook, translated into English as the\nCourse of Chymistry (1698), wrote:\nSeveral modern philosophers want to persuade us that it is uncertain\nwhether the substances we obtain from the mixts and which we have\ncalled Principles of Chemistry are present effectively and naturally in the\nmixts; they say that in rarifying matter in the distillations, \u0003re is capable\nof imparting to matter subsequently an arrangement that is quite different from the one it had previously and to form the salt, oil and other\nthings obtained.157\n154\nBolam, \u201cThe Botanical Works of Nehemiah Grew, F.R.S.

According\nto the Dictionary of Scienti\u0002c Biography (p. 1329), \u201cL\u00e9mery introduced his explanations of\nchemical reactions in terms of particle shape and movement on an ad hoc basis. Thus\nthe best way to explain the nature of salts is to attribute shapes to their constituent\nparticles. Acid salts must have sharp pointed particles because of their sharp taste and,\neven more convincingly, because they solidify in the form of sharp pointed crystals.\nContrariwise, alkalis are composed of earthy solid particles whose interstitial pores are\n155\n\nPages 106:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n89\nFor his part, L\u00e9mery argued that for volatile alkali salts (primarily ammonia), \u201cit is obvious that \u0003re has done something to this salt, because\nwhen it was in the plant it had not odor similar to that acquired by\nthe distillation.\u201d158\nBoyle\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Daniel Coxe, also engaged in this debate in his publications in the Royal Society Transactions, publications that apparently\nreached a wide audience. Herman Boerhaave cited Coxe\u2019s papers in\nwhich Coxe described that he took a plant, bruised and burnt it, and\nthen calcinated its ashes, extracting from it a volatile salt. He then made\na compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat; arising from\nthe ashes were salt crystals which resembled a stem, leaves and \u0002owers,\nan apparition of the plant which had been submitted to combustion.159\nCoxe also burned plants to ash, and percolated water through the ashes\nto obtain the lixivial or alkaline salts in an attempt to classify vegetative\nsalts and to illustrate a Van Helmontian principle. As these \u201calkalies\nwere also salts, questions regarding their production led directly to the\nquestion of whether or not they preexisted in combustible bodies.\u201d160\nAntonio Clericuzio has noted that Coxe denied that \u201c\u0003xed salts praeexisted in vegetables,\u201d thinking they were \u201cproduced, not extracted, by\nthe \u0003re. The salts alkali result from the combination of combination or\nunion of the saline and of the sulphureous principles.\u201d161 We not only\nsee this assertion in Coxe\u2019s published works in the Philosophical Transactions, but in a letter he wrote in 1666 to Boyle, when he states \u201cThat\nAlcalies, or \u0003xd salts made by incineration or Calcination seem not to\nhave been Such ea formac in the Concretes which afforded them by as\nso shaped as to admit entry of the spike particles of acid. L\u00e9mery postulated that, for\nreaction to take place between a particular acid and alkali, there must be an appropriate relationship between the size of the acid spikes and alkaline pores.\u201d\n158\nL\u00e9mery, Course of Chymistry, p. 20.\n159\nDaniel Coxe, \u201cA Continuation of Dr. Daniel Coxe\u2019s Discourse, Begun Numb. 107.\nTouching the Identity of All Volatile Salts\u201d Philosophical Transactions 9 (1674): 169\u2013182,\non pp. 174\u2013175.

While admitting that\nhe did get palingenic apparitions of plants via isolating salts, after\nconsulting with Royal Society fellow Robert Moray, who as we have\nseen had his own interests in salt chymistry, Coxe also argued that\nhis results were a \u201cmeer Phantasme, or a fortuitous Colation of Salt\nto such pretty \u0003gures\u201d to show that there was no saline principle that\ncould recreate the essence of a vegetable.163 Much for the same reason,\nCoxe also concluded from his researches that the \u201c\u0003xed salts extracted\nfrom the ashes of plants do not differ from one another\u201d again denying\nthere was any essential salt unique to each plant.164\nAlthough Grew followed a similar chemical procedure, he utilized\nhis botanical chymistry and microscopic expertise honed researching\nhis Anatomy of Plants to elaborate and question some of Coxe\u2019s, Boyle\u2019s,\nand hence Van Helmont\u2019s ideas about principles of matter.165 In his\nwork with plants, Grew believed \u0003rst that \u201cno principle was made\nby the \u0003re: all Principles being unalterable,\u201d and it was necessary\nto distinguish between elemental salt, or salt in its substantial form,\nwhich he did believe existed, and its \u201cmixture with other principles;\nfrom whence it may receive different Shapes and Names.\u201d166 Grew\nacknowledged that calcinations of a body, or its fermentation \u201cafter\nthe manner shewed by the curious Improver of chemical knowledge,\nDr. Daniel Cox . . . yieldeth some kind of Salt,\u201d and a \u201cLixivial Salt,\nqua Lixivial\u201d could be made by combustion.

However, he did allow for the possibility that salts created by the air were elemental salts containing the\nvital essence of a plant, and he believed he had created a process to\nextract such salts from vegetables. Grew took as his inspiration work\ndone by contemporaries that indicated volatile salts in the air, such\nas aerial nitre, possessed vitalizing and elemental principles. He also\nutilized the results of his chemical research to draw conclusions about\nplant structure and color, and like Lister, applied his results to other\nareas in natural history such as meteorology.\nSalts and Plant Structure\nGrew\u2019s extensive macroscopic and microscopic researches and the series\nof plates he drew in the Anatomy revealed to him that plants had a\nfundamental geometrical structure. In his studies, Grew concluded that\nthe \u201cleaves of most Plants, have a Regular Figure, and this Regularity,\nboth in Length and Circuit,\u201d is always de\u0003nable in terms of the arcs of\ncircles.168 At the microscopic level, leaves also had a mathematical\npattern of \u0003bres that underlay its structure, leading Grew to ask what was\nthe fundamental principle from which \u201cNature seems to draw her \u0003rst\nStrokes.\u201d169 For him, the key to the plant\u2019s regular structure lay in the\nSaline Principle \u201cunder which divers species were comprehended\u201d;\n\u201cwhether Alkaline, Acid, or of any other Kind . . . the Salts are, as it\nwere, the Bones\u201d of the plant.170 Grew\u2019s statement was likely in\u0002uenced\nby Paracelsian chemistry, as we have seen in chapter two that in the\n\u201cParacelsian scheme of the tria prima salt is the directive for matter to\nassume solidity and bodily shape.\u201d171\nGrew sought to prove this principle by \u0003rst noting that fertilizers that\nnourished plants contained salt. This suggested by analogy that plants\n167\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse Read before the Royal Society December 10, 1674 Concerning the Nature, Causes, and Power of Mixture,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants, p. 227.\n168\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 150.\n169\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 157.\n170\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\n171\nWalter Pagel, The Smiling Spleen: Paracelsianism in Storm and Stress (Basel and Munich:\nKarger, 1984), p. 37.\n\nPages 109:\n92\nchapter three\nwere also made of saline substances.172 In order to better understand\nhow salts combined to form the leaf structure, he then sought to classify\nthe types of vegetative salts. In the Producibleness of Chemical Principles\n(1681), Boyle had replaced the usual division of salts into acid and\nalkali with a tripartite division of salts into acid, alkaline, and urinous\nor volatile, (the latter category including nitre), a classi\u0003cation that Coxe\nwould also follow.173 However, Grew argued instead that vegetative\nsalts should be classi\u0003ed into four types\u2014nitrous, acid, alkaline, and\nmarine\u2014claiming \u201call the four salts have a share in the formation of\na leaf, or other part of a plant.\u201d174 Grew did acknowledge that lixiviating plants via \u0003re revealed that they contained a \u0003xed as well as a\nvolatile alkali; \u201cthe former in the ashes, the latter in the Soot\u201d; because\nplants yielded acid juices in distillation in a sand furnace, this testi\u0003ed\nto the presence of an acidic salt within them.175 But where did the\nfourth marine salt come from? Grew claimed he could produce a salt\nquite outside of the tripartite classi\u0003cation, \u201canother kind of salt . . . an\nessential salt,\u201d via the action of the air upon lixivial alkaline plant salts.\nThis essential salt would in turn, shoot another marine salt, showing\nthe air was \u201cnature\u2019s grand menstruum, which goes sometimes greater\nthan the Fire itself.\u201d176\nThough Grew does not speci\u0003cally state from where his idea of the\nair being a creative principle stemmed, it is likely his assertion may\nhave been a modi\u0003ed expression of a prevalent early modern belief in\nwitterung. Another stronger possibility is the work of William Harvey\u2019s\nstudent, Francis Glisson (1599\u20131677). Grew\u2019s microscopic work on plants\nbegan after his half-brother Henry Sampson mentioned a passage in\n172\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 275. See also Antonio Clericuzio,\n\u201cA rede\u0003nition of Boyle\u2019s chemistry and corpuscular philosophy,\u201d Annals of Science, 47\n(1990), pp. 561\u2013589, esp. pp. 588\u2013589. Robert Boyle, The Producibleness of Chymical\nPrinciples published as an appendix to The Skeptical Chymist, second edition (London,\n1681), pp. 9\u201310. As Clericuzio has indicated, Boyle was dissatis\u0003ed by the information\ngiven by using the color indicators syrup of violets or lignum nephriticum to determine\nalkalinity or acidity. This was because these tests only indicated if a salt was acid or\nnot, but one would not know if it was urinous or alkaline. Thus, \u201cBoyle suggested a\ntrail by the color non-acid salts showed when they were combined with sublimate dissolved in fair water.\u201d Lixivial salts, produced an \u201corange tawny precipitate, and urinous\nones white and milky.\u201d See Clericuzio, \u201cA rede\u0003nition,\u201d p. 588.\n174\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n175\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 158.\n176\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse Concerning the Essential and Marine Salts of Plants, Read\nBefore the Royal Society, December 21, 1676,\u201d Anatomy of Plants, p. 261.\n173\n\nPages 110:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n93\nGlisson\u2019s Anatome Hepatis, that drew comparisons between plant and\nanimal anatomy, something which Grew developed.177 Later in the\nHepatis, Glisson also wrote that \u201cevery plant has his peculiar spirit,\u201d\nwhich were made by \u201ceminent impressions\u201d of the atmosphere; Glisson also claimed these plant spirits were physico-chemical going on to\nnote that they may \u201cbe mixed with salt or subtle sulphur.\u201d178 And of\ncourse, the long-established tradition voiced by Paracelsus about a vital\nnitrous salt in the air, subsequently modi\u0003ed by Van Helmont in his\ntheory of human breath, may have also played a role.\nIn the case of plant salts, followers of Helmont and Boyle, like\nDaniel Coxe would argue that the salts in the air would interact with\n\u0003xed salts extracted from the ashes of plants, which Coxe believed\nwere all uniform irregardless of plant species. The air would make\n\u201ccorrupted\u201d compound salts that would fool the unwary chymist into\nthinking they were different chemical species.179 This claim of Coxe\u2019s\nwas the one that Grew desired to challenge, as he believed each plant\nhad a unique essential salt.\nGrew performed chemical experiments to prove his assertions. He\ntook an alkaline lixivial solution of the salt of Fern (likely chosen as\nCoxe often utilized it), placed it an earthen pan, and exposed it to the\nair on a windowsill. He noted in nine days that amongst a cremor that\nformed on the service, an essential salt began to shoot that was ambercolored, mild-tasting, and neither sour nor sharp; this result indicated\nto Grew that it was not acidic or alkali [see Figure 4].\nThe fact that this essential salt also did not react with alkalis or acids\nmeant it was clearly not \u201ctartar or tartareous salt\u201d which \u201cmakes a\n[e]bullition with alkaline salts.\u201d180 Grew was particularly interested in\ndemonstrating this salt was not tartar (potassium bitartrate) for a few\nreasons. First, Coxe had claimed tartars were formed by the \u0003re, stating \u201cmost Vegetables, whether Woods or Herbs, if burnt whilst they\nare green, and with a smothering \u0003re, yield Salts which are far enough\nfrom Alcalisate; being either Neutral or Acid; or to speak more properly,\n177\nBolam, \u201cBotanical Works,\u201d p. 220; Garret, \u201cVitalism and teleology,\u201d p. 68.\nFrancis Glisson, Anatome Hepatis (The Anatomy of the Liver), 1654, ed.

Not only did Van Helmont demonstrate in his\nexperiment that alkali salts were made by \u0003re, but he showed that in\nan open vessel, a smaller amount of tartar was produced than in a\nclosed vessel.182 Grew however stressed that the crystals he produced\nwere \u201cno sort of Tartar, or Tartareous Salt. As is plain, from the manner\nof their Generation; Tartar being still bred in close Vessels; these never, but\nby exposing the Liquor to the Aer.\u201d183 He therefore thought the salt he\nhad discovered was a unique essential salt of the plant, \u201cdifferent in\nNature from all other Salts hitherto known, or a new Species added\nto the inventory of Nature.\u201d184\nThis essential salt of Fern was then allowed to continue to crystallize,\nand after two weeks, began to shoot another salt that in its microscopic\nshape and taste led Grew to conclude it was a \u201cmarine salt produced\nby art in the imitation of nature.\u201d185 This Marine Salt, cuboidal and\n\u201cof greater Bulk,\u201d was considered by Grew to be the foundation\nof the leaves\u2019 skeleton; here Grew alluded to the idea that the cube\namong the Platonic solids was considered the most stable, and thus\nit was appropriate to be the basis of a structure.186 The \u0003bers which\ndetermined the shape of the leaf were, as Grew\u2019s microscopic observations showed, \u201cgoverned by air vessels;\u201d the generation of these vessells\nwas \u201cdetermined by the . . . Salts according to their several Angles.\u201d187\nMarine salts produced right angles, and alkaline salts were square at\none end, and pointed at the other; placed ended to end, alkaline salts\nwould form oblique angles. Acid salts had a more crooked nature, and\nby \u201capplying the lesser Side of one to the greater Side of another,\u201d\nwould form circular or Spiral lines.188 Combinations of the various\nsalts would thus produce a variety of differently-shaped air vessels and\nshapes of leaves [Figure 5].\n181\nCoxe, \u201cA Discourse Denying the Prae-Existence of Alcalizate or Fixed Salt in\nany subject, before it were exposed to the Fire.\u201d Philosophical Transactions, 9 (1674), pp.\n150\u2013158, on p. 151.\n182\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy tried in the Fire, p. 87.\n183\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n184\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n185\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 263.\n186\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n187\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n188\nGrew, Anatomy of Plants, p. 159.\n\nPages 112:\nFigure 4.

To prove his assertion, Grew of course \u0003rst had to \u201cremove an\nOpinion standing in my way,\u201d namely the assertion that all alkaline salts\nfrom plants were the same as they were uniformly created by the \u0003re,\nas \u201csome Learned men have thought,\u201d an oblique reference to Boyle\nand Coxe.189 To allow the largest degree of impartiality possible, Grew\nhad salts prepared \u201cwith great care herein\u201d by an outside apothecary,\none John Blackstone, who stated in print that \u201call the lixivial salts\nmentioned in this and foregoing Discourse except that of Firne, were\nfaithfully prepared by me\u201d signing his name underneath his statement;\nBlackstone\u2019s more lowly social status as an apothecary would mean he\nhad to commit to a printed oath so his assertion would be accepted as\ntrue.190 Grew dissolved these lixivial alkaline salts from different plants\ninto water, and he argued that each solution had a distinctive and\nunique taste. In an earlier 1674 paper for the Philosophical Transactions\nCoxe had intimated that the different tastes for the salts were due to\nsome of the plant\u2019s oils contaminating the salts, so having Blackstone\nmake the careful preparations was important for Grew to assure saline\npurity.191 Then Grew let each solution be exposed to the air to produce\nthe different essential salts of each plant. Microscopic observation also\nillustrated that each essential salt had a unique structure and color,\narguing for their species-speci\u0003c nature [Figure 4]. Grew therefore\naccomplished what was in his eyes a truer type of plant palingenesis\nvia the medium of air rather than Coxe\u2019s use of \u0003re, and he thought\nthat he recreated the plant\u2019s essential saline structure.\n189\nGrew, \u201cEssential and Marine Salts of Plants,\u201d p. 264.\nAs Steven Shapin has illustrated in A Social History of Truth, standards for epistemological truth in seventeenth-century science had their origin in gentlemen\u2019s codes of\nhonor. There was an equation between gentility, honor, and truth-telling that extended\nto empirical observation; the observations of Robert Boyle would be trusted more than\nthose by an artisan. Gentlemen, by virtue of their social status, were considered more\ncompetent sensory agents, and hence they were more likely to be leaders of opinion\nin the scienti\u0003c community.

In a paper, \u201cA Discourse\nof the Colors of Plants,\u201d read before the Royal Society in 1677,\nGrew stated that the green color of leaves was a chemical precipitate\nthat formed when the acidic salts and sulphurs that plants contained\nmixed with volatile alkali salts in the air.192 Similar chemical reactions\ncontrolled the colors of \u0002owers. Like early Paracelsian chymists, Grew\nwas attributing color to salts.\nGrew \u0003rst isolated the chemical substances within plants that he\nbelieved caused the green color of leaves. He poured sulphuric and\nnitric acid on \u201cseveral parts of vegetables,\u201d \u0003nding they made less of\na chemical reaction than acids poured on parts of animals. This led\nhim to conclude that in \u201cmost Plants, the Preadominant Principle is\nan Acid,\u201d particularly in the parenchyma, whereas animal substances\ncontained more alkalis.193 Grew also argued that plants contained\nsulphur, especially in the wood, as there was a large amount of resinous sap in the wood\u2019s lympheducts, the sap having the same oily and\n\u0002ammable properties of sulphureous substances. He then performed a\nseries of experiments in which he dropped the alkali spirit of hartshorn\n(aqueous solution of ammonia) or sal ammoniac on tinctures of \u0002owers and on leaves. Spirit of Hartshorn on tinctures of borage \u0002ower\nturned them \u201cverdigreese Green,\u201d and when it was dropped on green\nleaves, the color did not change at all, leading him to postulate that\nthere was some alkaline \u201cor like salt in the Air, which is predominant\nin the production of Green in the Leavs of Plants.\u201d194 According to\nhis reasoning, roots of most plants were white because they were not\nexposed to the volatile alkaline salts in the air, noting that the upper\nparts of roots, \u201cwhen they happen to stand naked about the Ground,\u201d\nwere colored by the air, such as in red sorrel roots or purple radish\ntops.195 Transverse cuts of plant stalks showed a white bark parenchyma,\n192\nGrew, \u201cA Discourse of the Colors of Plants,\u201d Anatomy of Plants, p. 271.\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort of the Luctation Arising from the Affusion of\nSeveral Menstruums upon all Sorts of Bodies, Exhibited to the Royal Society, April\n13, and June 1, 1676,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants, p. 240.\n194\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n195\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 270.\n193\n\nPages 115:\n98\nchapter three\nbut sap vessels which admitted the aerial volatile salts were as \u201cgreen as\nthe skin itself because they stand close to the Aer-Vessels.\u201d196 Flowers\nin bud also tended to be whitish until exposed to the alkaline salts in\nthe air.\nThe colors of \u0002owers were produced by differing combinations of\nvolatile alkaline salts and substances within the plant. Grew tested\nputting spirit of sulphur (sulphuric acid) on plant leaves, \u0003nding that\ndropped on green leaves, it turned the leaves yellow, but had no effect\nwhen dropped on yellow \u0002owers. He concluded therefore that \u201cin\nall yellow [\u0002owers] the sulphureous acids and the alkaline parts are\nall more equal.\u201d197 Spirit of Sulphur dropped into tincture of violets\nturned this Ph indicator from blue to crimson, and likewise when spirit\nof sulphur was dropped onto a tincture of clove-july \u0002owers it made\nthem bright blood red, and also heightened the red of roses. Thus, as\n\u201calkalis are predominant in Greens,\u201d acids dominated in red \u0002owering\nplants.198 From these and other chemical experiments, Grew formulated\nthe following rules:\n1. When sulphur and aerial saline principles \u201conly swam together\u201d but\nwere not united chemically, no color was produced, as was the case\nin roots.\n2. When sulphur and alkaline salts were united, they produced green\ncolors.\n3. When sulphur, alkaline, and acid salts were in equal proportions and\nreacting with each other, a yellow \u0002ower was produced.\n4. When the sulphur predominated, and the acid and alkaline were\nequal, there \u201cwas a blew.\u201d\n5. If the sulphur was most predominant to the \u201calkaline and acid,\u201d\n\u0002owers were scarlet.\n6. Variegated colors were the \u201cover proportion of the Lympheducts to\nthe Aer-Vessels,\u201d [in different parts of the \u0002ower and leaves], and\ntherefore the dominion of the Sulphure over the Air therein.\u201d199\nGrew postulated that yellow and green \u0002owers and leaves suffered less\nloss of color when dried because the volatile salts in \u201cthe Aer being\n196\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 270.\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n198\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 276.\n199\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.

For example, in 1674, John\nMayow (1640\u20131679) in his Tractatus Quinque Medico-Physici, claimed that\nair was composed of a \u201csmall proportion of highly reactive particles\nwhich he identi\u0003ed as a nitro-aerial spirit\u201d; like oxygen, \u201cthese particles\nalone made air suitable for respiration, and when absorbed through the\nlungs they imparted the bright red color to arterial blood.\u201d201 As we\nhave seen in the work of Lister, many early modern natural philosophers thought that respiration and anatomy in plants and animals was\ndirectly analogous. Marcello Malphigi (1628\u20131694), who submitted his\nown manuscript on plant anatomy to the Royal Society approximately\nat the same time as it had agreed to publish Grew\u2019s work The Anatomy\nof Vegetables (1671), asserted that the venation of leaves was analogous\nto the system of capillaries in animals.202 Because the pith of plant\nstems was enclosed, Malphigi also compared it with the heart and brain\nof animals, and wood with animal bones and teeth.203 Grew himself\nthought the root was similar to mouth into which entered a solution\nof nutrients and water, as well as air.204 However, Grew also realized\nthat animal circulation of the blood required valves, whereas no such\nvalves could be found when he traced the movement of plant sap.205\nThus, despite the arguments of his peers that circulation in plants and\nanimals, and thus chemical reactions in blood and sap were directly\n200\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.\nHenry Guerlac, \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Nitre,\u201d Isis 45, 3 (September 1954): pp. 243\u2013255,\non p. 243.\n202\nAgnes Arber, \u201cNehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694):\nAn Essay in Comparison,\u201d Isis, 34, 1 (Summer 1942), pp. 7\u201316, on p. 13.\n203\nArber, \u201cNehemiah Grew (1641\u20131712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694): An\nEssay in Comparison,\u201d p. 13.\n204\nC.A.

Tulips\u201d were made this way; in Holland in the\n1630s, \u201ctulip fever\u201d arose for striped or variegated blooms in which\nscandalous sums were paid for a prized bulb, making this topic one\nof timely concern for the Royal Society\u2019s efforts.207 Changing the soil,\nor transplanting seeds from one bed to another would also lead the\nplant to be \u201csuperimpregnated with several Tinctures.\u201d208 Lastly, mixing\nsoil with differing salts that \u201cwould concur with the Aer, to strike or\nprecipitate their Sulphur into so many several colors,\u201d would \u201cbring\neven Natures Art of Painting, in a great part, into our own power.\u201d209\nEarly chymistry had \u201clong preserved the very recipes for pigments\nthat were the daily bread of those who composed their own painting\nmedia\u201d; Grew\u2019s methods were another means for the chemist to be an\nartist of nature.210\nAlong with color, Grew believed the tastes of plants were also based\nupon saline chymistry, and could also be manipulated. Grew \u0003rst postulated that plants that had a pungent taste did so because after the\nsaliva dissolved their juices, their biting or nitrous salts remained on the\ntongue.211 He hence concluded that Arum, which had a bitter nitrous\ntaste, would thus grow best under a hedge, as the ground was not\n206\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 272.\nGrew, \u201cThe Colors of Plants,\u201d p. 278.

The Dutch government declared it would\nnot honor tulip contracts created before 1636, considering them gambling debts.\n208\nGrew\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 98 to page 117 out of a total of 312.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The summarized content from pages 98 to 117 focuses on the study of plant salts and their role in early natural history and chemistry. Key topics include:

1. <strong>Plant Respiration and Weather</strong>:
   - Lister posits that plants exhale moisture, contributing to the formation of dew and rain. He also speculated that plant exhalation could cause trade winds. This connects natural history with early meteorological theories about how environmental elements interact [Lister, *De Fontibus*, p. 98](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=98).

2. <strong>Nehemiah Grew&#x27;s Botanical Work</strong>:
   - Grew (1641–1712) studied plant anatomy and salt chemistry, proposing that salts were fundamental to the structure of plants. He categorized salts as alkaline, acidic, nitrous, and marine, and believed each played a role in plant growth and color [Grew, *Anatomy of Plants*, 1682, p. 105](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=105).

3. <strong>Salts and Plant Colors</strong>:
   - Grew experimented with plant tinctures, showing that volatile salts in the air, combined with sulphur and acids, caused the color changes in plants. His experiments aimed to demonstrate how green and red plant colors were chemically produced through interactions with air [Grew, *Discourse of the Colors of Plants*, p. 115](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=115).

The\npure nitre of Arum entered into the concavity of the nervous \u0003bers of\nthe tongue, and \u201cso being lodged there, is little affected or stirred, by\nthe Motion of the Blood, but only when the Tongue itself is moved,\nat which time it contains a kind of pricking Taste.\u201d213 Aquatic plants\nalso tended to be biting, because \u201cwater being, though it self cold,\nyet the Menstruum by which all Salts are imbibed most easily, and in\nlater states of Commixture with other Principles.\u201d214 If the plant was\nhot in taste, it was because the \u0002ammable sulphur in the lympheducts\nof the plant, the particles of which \u201cbeing spherick and bored with\nholes,\u201d contained salts.215 Grew resorted to the mechanical action of\nmatter to explain the sense of taste, explaining that the salt\u2019s angular\nstructure within the sulphur meant that they \u201ctore\u201d the \u0003bres of the\ntongue as they interacted with them, and in suf\u0003cient quality would\nraise a blister.\nSalts, their solubility, and barometric pressure\nThe structure of plant salts, as well as the varieties of lixivial salts that\nGrew \u201cdiscovered,\u201d led him to be interested in their relative degree\nof solubility.

And it was referred to Me by this Honourable Chair,\nto examine and produce the Experiment. The doing whereof brought\ninto my mind divers other Experiments hereunto relating.216\nWhen performing experiments where he supersaturated water with\nthree salts at once\u2014common salt, nitre and sal ammoniac\u2014Grew noted\nthat the different salts had different solubility. This led him to conclude\nthat not only the \u201cvisible crystals, but the very Atomes of the Salt . . .\nhave a different Figure one from another . . . because if they were all\nof one Figure, there would be no Superimpregnation.\u201d217 The differing\n\u201csuperimpregnation\u201d of salts in water also had medical implications,\nas although compounded infusions could be prepared, the physician\ncould not \u201cinfuse all manner of Ingredients in any proportion,\u201d as some\nwould precipitate out; adding more of a solute than a solution could\nbear would be unnecessary to the ef\u0003cacy of its healing properties.218\nGrew then wondered if \u201cby dissolving of a Salt in Water, there by\nany space gained, or not;\u201d in other words, would the level of the water\nin a \u0002ask be greater before or after the salt in it was fully dissolved?219\nAfter a series of experiments in which Grew \u0003lled a bolt head (globular\n\u0002ask with a long cylindrical neck, used in distillation) with a pint of\nwater, marked the level on the stem, and then put in salt, Grew found\nthe water level decreased. This led him to speculate that there were\nvacuities in water in which the salts lodged, but much to his surprise,\nthere was not always a direct relationship between the \u201cspaces gained\nby the several Salts\u201d and their solubility. He concluded that there were\ndifferent vacuities in water: \u201csome salts, more dissoluble, increasing the\nBulk of the Water less, and others less dissoluble,\u201d increasing it more.220\nHe continued, \u201cI say, that this difference dependeth not only on the\ndifferent Figures of the Atomes of Salts: because then every Salt which\nis more dissoluble, would quantity for quantity take less room in the\n216\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 296.\n217\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 297.\n218\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 299.\n219\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 300.\n220\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 300.\n\nPages 120:\nvan helmont, salts, and natural history\n103\nWater, which is contrary to the experiment.\u201d221 Grew also thought that\nalthough salts he tested were all different \u201c\u0003gures,\u201d water was a \u0002uid, its\natoms were hard and consistent, and unalterable. Just as Grew believed\nthat the elemental saline principle could not be altered by the \u0003re, so it\nseems he believed that elemental water itself was unchangeable. This\nmay have been a challenge to Boyle\u2019s corpuscular beliefs which were\nagainst \u201cthe idea of \u0003xed chemical species\u201d and that promoted substances \u201clike alkali salts could be made by various agents into anything\nand converted by various agents into anything.\u201d222\nGrew then asked, \u201cwhat that just space might be, which any Salt\ngaineth upon Dissolution, with respect to its own Bulk, or the Bulk\nof the Water?\u201d223 Because water and spirit of wine dissolved salts so\ncompletely \u201cwhereby the observation of the true Bulk of the Salt,\u201d and\n\u201cconsequently of the just space it gaineth by the Dissolution is lost,\u201d\nGrew did not use these substances as his solvents, but rather utilized oil\nof turpentine.224 Placing the oil in a bolt head, he then put in different\nsalts to measure the oil\u2019s ascent, claiming that the space in which the oil\nascended was a true measure of the salt\u2019s bulk. Taking that \u0003gure of the\nascent of oil, and subtracting from it the level which the salts attained\nin being dissolved in water, would leave him \u201cthe space which the same\nSalts take up upon Dissolution.\u201d225 From this technique, Grew claimed\none could \u0003nd the speci\u0003c gravity of salts, and noted their gravity was\ndirectly proportional to their \u0003xity, and inversely to their volatility; in\nhis experimental trials, common salt was revealed to be the heaviest\nand also the most chemically inert, followed by nitre \u201csomewhat less\n\u0003xed . . . [and] somewhat lighter,\u201d alum, and then sal ammoniac which\nwas wholly volatile and the \u201clightest of all Salts mentioned.\u201d226\nFrom these conclusions, Grew ended his paper with a practical application of his results\u2014namely with an argument that barometric variations were not due \u201cnot so much with the meer Weight of the air,\u201d but\n221\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 301.\n222\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 278.\n223\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 300.\n224\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 301.\n225\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 301.\n226\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 302.\n\nPages 121:\n104\nchapter three\nwere affected by the changing concentrations of saline bodies which\naffected atmospheric pressure.227 Mercury rose in the barometer for\nseveral days before a snowstorm or rainstorm, and this was because\n\u201cthe Aer is crowded with more and more Saline parts, which by the\nWinds, or otherwise, are carried into it; and so causeth it to press\nupon the Mercury in the Box.\u201d228 But a day or so before the storm,\nthe mercury fell; if the weight of the air were the only explanation for\nthe barometer\u2019s behavior, Grew thought the mercury would fall as the\nstorm actually occurred. Instead it fell before the front passed through.\nTo explain this phenomenon, Grew argued that more volatile salts in\nthe atmosphere would take up less space in the air when dissolved in\nthe watery parts of the atmosphere than when they were undissolved.\nThus, as the storm approached, the\nSalts are dissolved or incorporated into the Aqueous Parts of the Aer, as\nin Rain or Snow; so soon as that is done, there is some Space gained;\nand so before any Weather falleth, the Aer is less crowded, and presseth\nless upon the Mercury in the Box, which gives way to its descent in the\ncylinder.229\nGrew therefore posited an entirely chemical explanation for Boyle\u2019s\n\u201cspring of the air.\u201d This was something which Boyle was hesitant to do via\nhis corpuscularian philosophy as he often displayed ambivalence between\nchemical and mechanical explanations for natural phenomena.230\nGrew also believed that nitre\u2019s ability to chill substances meant that\nit was more prevalent in cold winds than warm, explaining why the\nmercury rose higher with cold winds as the nitre took up more space\nin the air and increased barometric pressure. The same mechanism\nexplained while the mercury rose higher before a snowstorm than a\nrainstorm, as in the production of snow, \u201cthe Aer is crowded with a\ngreater quantity of Nitre, or some other like Salts; which before they\n227\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 303.\n228\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 303.\n229\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 304.\n230\nFor Boyle\u2019s reticence to explain the \u201cspring of the air,\u201d see Steven Shapin and\nSimon Schaffer.

As mentioned\nearlier, increasing emphasis on microscopic analysis of salts to demonstrate their status as exemplars of form, was carried to many objects\nin the natural world. Microscopic examination of snow was a focus of\nmuch research in the Royal Society in the latter part of the seventeenth\ncentury; John Beale, Robert Hooke, and Grew all did observations in\nreaction to the initial \u0003ndings of Ren\u00e9 Descartes about ice crystallization. The crystalline form of snow was compared by Grew to \u201cregular\n\u0003gures as we see in divers other bodies.\u201d232 In particularly, the single\nshoots of snow, \u201cas so many short slender Cylinders\u201d were \u201clike those\nof Nitre . . . Nitre is formed, as is commonly known into long Cylindrical\nshoots, as also all Lixivial Salts for the most part; resembling, though\nnot perfectly, the several points of each Starry Icicle of Snow.\u201d233 Some\nof their ideas may have been suggested by Paracelsus who \u201crepeatedly\nexplained thunder and lightening in terms of an aerial nitre\u201d and who\nalso claimed that as \u201csnow grows in the heavens, so salniter and other\nthings grow out of the \u0003re;\u201d Glauber and Duchesne and John Mayow\nalso expressed such ideas, and we saw Lister believed vitriolic salts had\nthe same effect.234 Though Grew acknowledged that other volatile salts\nsuch as sal ammoniac or salts of hartshorn, \u201cbesides their main and\nlonger shoots, have others, shorte branched out from them; resembling\nas those the main, so these the Collateral points of Snow,\u201d the \u201cicicles of\nUrine [ Nitre] are still more near.\u201d235 Grew believed that every drop of\nrain had spirituous particles, their presence evident as rain was thought\nto volatilize faster than water. The spirits in the rain combined with the\nsaline elements in the air, \u201cpartly nitrous, but chie\u0002y urinous, or of an\nacido-salinous nature\u201d which \u0003xed the snow\u0002ake.236 The regular shape\nof the \u0002ake was due to the energy of spirit of the rain which acted as\n231\nGrew, \u201cExperiments in Consort Upon the Salts in Water,\u201d in Anatomy of Plants,\np. 304.\n232\nGrew, \u201cSome Observations Touching the Nature of Snow, Presented to the Royal\nSociety,\u201d Philosophical Transactions 8 (1673): pp. 5193\u20135196, on p. 5195.\n233\nGrew, \u201cSome Observations Touching the Nature of Snow,\u201d p. 5195.\n234\nA.G.

In his 1695 treatise\nconcerning his discovery of Epsom or \u201cpurging salts,\u201d which was based\non unpublished lectures he gave at the Royal Society in 1679, he argued\nthat the \u201cbeing\u201d or essential nature of the salts, and their ability to\nchange the color of syrup of violets were \u201cnot wholly and altogether\ndepend[ant] on the Fire.\u201d239 The bitter taste of the Epsom salts was\nalso not created by the \u0003re, but rather augmented by it, which showed\nthe \u201c\u0003xedness of its principles.\u201d240 Further, before the Purging salt had\n\u201cfelt the Fire,\u201d it was alkaline, \u201cbut when it was well burnt, it was in\nsome sort Lixivial albeit we may not so properly call it Lixivial, nor\nperhaps by any other Name which Use hath approved: for the Furniture\nof Words is in nothing more scanty.\u201d241 Grew\u2019s comment not only have\nre\u0002ected the traditional \u201cnullius in verbo\u201d thrust of the Royal Society, but\nalso may have illustrated the growing primacy of saline chymistry as\nconceptualized by Van Helmont, and subsequently Boyle whose use of\nchemical names would become more and more \u201capproved.\u201d\nIf words proved unsatisfactory to describe his chemical research,\nGrew\u2019s admiration for nature\u2019s ability to \u201cdraw\u201d or \u201cpaint\u201d the varieties of plants and \u0002owers was not, showing his commitment to \u201cthe\nidenti\u0003cation of nature with art.\u201d242 Nature used salts to \u201cdraw\u201d and\nform the beauty and intricacy he saw in his observations of plants at\nthe macroscopic and microscopic levels as well as to \u201cpaint\u201d \u0002owers and\nleaves with chemical pigments; in 82 plates in the Anatomy of Plants he\n237\nGrew, \u201cSome Observations Touching the Nature of Snow,\u201d p. 5196.\nGrew, \u201cSome Observations Touching the Nature of Snow,\u201d p. 5196.\n239\nGrew, A Treatise of the Nature and Use of the Bitter Purging Salt.

Grew\u2019s work, as well as the natural philosophy of Philipot,\nMoray, and Lister demonstrated chymistry\u2019s status as both creative art\nand science, the tensions between early modern conceptions of matter\nthat stressed chemical mechanism as well as vital principles, and the\ndiffering conceptions of elemental principles.\n243\nD.

This chapter\nwill demonstrate that at the end of the seventeenth century however,\ninterest in the salt principle began to decline. Belief in the salt principle\ndiminished, and there was growing interest in the idea of a universal\nacid as the basic mover in processes of nature; it was usually identi\u0003ed\nas sulphuric acid.1 As Emerton has noted, in the seventeenth century,\nit was believed that acids or \u201csaline spirits\u201d were the most powerful\nchemical agents, and they were increasingly important in the chemical\nlaboratory as chemical reactions in solution predominated over older\ndistillation processes.2 The use of acids and alkalis in iatrochymical\ntreatments of Boerhaave and Franciscus Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius (1614\u20131672),\nas well as Boyle\u2019s re\u0003nement of colored indicators in detecting acidity\nled to this shift in emphasis.\nAfter a brief contextual discussion of the rise of acids and alkalis\nin chemical and iatrochymical theory, we will start this chapter with a\ndiscussion of William Simpson. Simpson was a physician from York who\nsettled in Chapel Street in London, a chymist and an English Helmontian who was representative of this shift from salts to saline spirits.\nSimpson\u2019s father was a brewer, and he himself has been described as\nan experimentalist more comfortable in the laboratory than the study.3\nSimpson\u2019s concept of the fermentation of saline spirits or acids in the\natmosphere and the body, discussed in his Zymologia Physica (1675) owed\nsome of its premises to Van Helmont, some to the Iatrochymical School,\nparticularly the works of Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius and Tachenius, and some\n1\nRobert P.

The nature of Simpson\u2019s\ntheories of fermentation has been largely neglected in scholarly analysis,\na state of affairs likely due to focus upon his disagreement with both\nMartin Lister (see chapter three) and Robert Wittie, another chymist\nand analyst of spa waters. The dispute centered upon about the role of\nsalts and saline spirits in the spa waters and metallogenesis. Dr. Robert\nWittie published Scarborough Spaw in 1660 which advocated the waters\nas a cure for all ills, recommending that the waters were best drunk\nmid-May to mid-September and inadvertently initiating the summer\nseason in spa towns. In his Hydrologica Chymica (1669) Simpson refuted\nWittie\u2019s claims made for the mineral spring waters, and the medical\ndebate spread beyond local boundaries to the Royal Society in London.4\nBut there was more to Simpson than his role in this debate. When we\nturn to Simpson\u2019s tracts on fermentation, we will also see that although\nit is generally true Newtonianism caused the decline of Van Helmontian\nmedicine and chemistry in England, that Simpson was an important\ntransitional \u0003gure combining Newtonian ideas about acidic fermentation with Helmontian ideas about volatile salts.5\nWe will then subsequently analyze the role of saline chymistry in the\ntreatises of early eighteenth-century Newtonian physicians after Simpson. It has been well documented by Guerrini that Newtonian physicians\nsuch as Bryan Robinson (1680\u20131754), Archibald Pitcairne (1652\u20131713),\nGeorge Cheyne (1671\u20131743) and Richard Mead (1673\u20131754) posited\na \u201cNewtonian physiology\u201d based on the premises in the Principia, as\nwell as queries in Newton\u2019s Opticks (1704\u201322) and the De Natura Acidorum (1710).6 Her emphasis however was primarily in the application\nof Newtonian physics and conceptions of the aether to medicine; I\nwill concentrate in this chapter instead upon Newton\u2019s chemical works\nabout salts and acids and their in\u0002uence in the medical community in\nBritain and Ireland.\n4\nWilliam Simpson, Hydrologia chymica, or, The chymical anatomy of the Scarbrough, and\nother spaws in York-Shire: wherein are interspersed, some animadversions upon Dr. Wittie\u2019s lately\npublished treatise of the Scarbrough Spaw . . .

We have seen that, under the in\u0002uence of Van Helmont,\nthe nature of \u0003xed alkaline salts created by calcining plants was a\nresearch preoccupation of the Royal Society. Boyle also was involved\nin the classi\u0003cation of salts. As has been documented by Clericuzio,\nin his Usefulness of Experimental Naturall Philosophy (1663) Boyle classi\u0003ed\nsalts comprehensively and distinguished three types: acid, alkalizate or\nlixivial, and urinous or volatile. Principe and Newman have also demonstrated that Boyle drew a contrast between the Helmontian alkahest\nand \u201ccommon corrosive saline liquors\u201d or acids and alkalis.7 The liquors,\nderived from salts via distillation, deliquescence, lixiviation, and solution\nwere of three types: acid (such as nitric acid), urinous (ammonia and\nits salts), and alkalizates (\u0003xed alkalies such as potassium and sodium\ncarbonates).

Van Helmont believed matter\nwas created by water and ferment, or seminal origin; \u201cthe ferment is\nan indwelling formative energy which disposes . . . water so that a seed\nis produced and life, and the mass develops into a stone, plant, or animal.\u201d9 In the body, the \u201cinternal ef\u0003cient cause\u201d or life force was called\nthe Archeus, and Van Helmont believed its seat was in the stomach,\nthough archei also existed in the liver and other parts of the body. In\nthese organs, ferments via chemical processes occurred to bring about\ndigestion and other changes in physiology. Though Sylvius believed\nthat ferments occurred, he generally rejected the Archeus in favor of\nexplanations that relied on a purely chymical basis such as fermentations of the neutral saliva, acid pancreatic juice and alkaline bile.10\nBile had alkaline lixivial salt, pancreatic juice had acid and a volatile\nspirit, and chyle had lixivial salt, water and some acid.11 Alkalis and\nacids mixed together would effervesce and usually produced heat, just\nas oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid) reacts with volatile alkali (ammonium\ncarbonate); unnatural effervescence resulting from too much acidity or\nalkalinity (which he termed acridity) caused disease.12 The cure was\nproviding a medicament of the opposite Ph.13 As Parthington stated,\nSylvius believed that most disease was caused by corrosive acids, fever\nby an excess of alkalinity, and plague was due to volatile salts in the\nblood which gave it \u201can abnormal \u0002uidity opposing its coagulation; this\nis proved by injecting a solution of the volatile salt into the veins, when\nthe symptoms of plague are produced and hence an acid is used as a\nremedy.\u201d14 The atmosphere itself could also in\u0002uence bodily processes\nsuch as respiration; Sylvius wrote,\nBy what power, or in what manner and way the inspired air so alters the\nblood is not equally clear. I for my part think that it is brought about by\nreason of there being dispersed in the air nitrous and subacid particles\n9\nJ.B. Van Helmont, Ortus Medicinae . . .

The nitric acid was brought\nby the north wind from the north, where it is expelled into the air from\nsubterranean \u0003res; the second is brought by the south wind. When the\ntwo mix, cold is produced, as when sal ammoniac dissolves in water;\ngreater cold is produced when the north wind carries common salt, and\nvery intense cold when it brings volatile alkaline salt.16\nThe heat of the heart resulted from the fermentation of the acid chyle\nand the alkaline blood, and that the vapours emitted \u201cin this effervescence are expelled with the expired air.\u201d17\nAs Frank has shown, Sylvius\u2019 idea of acid-alkaline fermentation and\nebullition was extremely in\u0002uential among English iatrochymists and\nphysicians of the seventeenth century, particularly the Oxford physiologists in the 1650s.18 Their inquiries were given impetus by Thomas\nWillis\u2019s idea of fermentation in the Diatribae duae medico-philosophicae\n(1658). The Diatribae was the English work responsible for introducing\niatromechanism to medicine, and had been readily accepted by the\nCollege of Physicians because it successfully combined an innovative\nexplanation of fever as due to mechanical action and reaction between\ncorpuscles of chemical matter with traditional Galenic treatments of\nvomits and purges that members of the college favored and the patients\nanticipated.19 Willis\u2019s theory of fermentation was thus likewise in\u0002uential. Willis believed that there was a nitro-sulphurous ferment in the\nheart which caused bodily heat and propelled the blood throughout the\nbody. This ferment represented the vital \u0002ame responsible for animal\n15\nDele Bo\u00eb Sylvius, Disputationum Medicarum Decas Primarias Corporis Humani Functiones\nNaturalise Nec non Febrium Naturam (Amsterdam, 1663), p. 69 as quoted in Partington,\np. 288.\n16\nDele B\u00f6e Sylvius, De Affectus Epidemii Anno 1669 Leidensem Civitem depopulantia in\nOpera Medica, ed J.

One of Simpson\u2019s Two\nSmall Treatises made an analogy between blood and wine that was quite\nreminiscent of Willis\u2019 discourse on the \u201cinkindling of the blood,\u201d which\nalso drew a comparison between blood circulation and \u201cWine and other\nliquors agitated into Fermentation.\u201d21 Simpson was also an author of\nseveral treatises on spa waters and one of the main adversaries in one\nof the most famous seventeenth-century medical debates engendered by\nDr. Robert Wittie\u2019s (1613\u20131684) Scarbrough spaw (1660) a work in which\nhe advocated the mineral waters at Scarborough as a cure-all.22 This\n\u201cquarrel\u201d was not only about the formation of minerals, but a debate\namong English physicians in the latter part of the seventeenth century\nabout which particular salt was the most effective active ingredient in\nhealing. Simpson believed the main active ingredients in the waters\nwas nitre; Wittie proposed that along with alum, vitriol was a major\ncomponent of the waters, along with nitre and iron.\nAs the result of these debates prompted by Simpson\u2019s publications,\nMartin Lister himself apparently took a personal dislike to Simpson\nand related his qualms about Simpson\u2019s character to Henry Oldenburg\nin a 1675 letter. Though Simpson was nominated as a Royal Society\nfellow that year, he dedicated his Zymologia Physica to that scienti\u0003c body,\nand it was reviewed extensively and sympathetically in the Philosophical\nTransactions, he was never elected.23\nLister\u2019s dislike of Simpson may have been related to Simpson\u2019s contrary\ntheories about the role of fermentation in blood, as well as Simpson\u2019s\nthoughts about spa waters. In his De Humoribus, Lister denied there\nwas fermentation in the blood, as nitre or any other acid was not suf\u0003ciently volatile to exist in the air to engender fermentation.

Simpson also rejected others of Lister\u2019s\nand Wittie\u2019s hypotheses in his Hydrologica Chymica (1669). First, Simpson\ndeclared, contrary to Lister, that it was impossible for any metal or salt\nto release vapors to water and heat it. Only the sun could \u201cresolve the\nVitriol into a vapour,\u201d and \u201cthat Vitriol may dissolve in simple Water,\nwe have before granted, but that it should give a vapour to the Water, I\nunderstand not.\u201d25 Rejecting the principle of witterung, another major\nhypothesis in Lister\u2019s De Fontibus, Simpson also thought that an acid\nessurine or universal salt dissolved in water, met with copper not iron,\nproducing vitriol in its reaction. Given Lister\u2019s emphasis on the role of\niron in natural phenomena, this was a major challenge.\nAs a Helmontian, Simpson generally thought that water was the\nsource of metallogenesis and general matter formation. Speci\u0003cally,\nafter the acidity of the salt was \u201ccoagulated on the metalline dissolv\u2019d\nparts . . . and so both together become dissolv\u2019d in the solitary Spring\nWater, in an almost indissolvable texture, then, and not till then, is the\naction of that Essurine acidity terminated.\u201d26 The acidity of the essurine\nsaline spirit thus exhausted, if it met with a vein of iron, no further\nreaction or production of vitriol would occur. As Simpson stated, \u201cMars\ncannot be dissolved and appear in the form of a liquor, without a dissolvent; but this dissolvent . . . the Essurine acidity, being already . . . turned\ninto a Vitriol . . . is not at leisure to make another of them.\u201d27 He\nspeculated in the epilogue that this \u201cessurine Salt, which I call the\nEssence of Scarborough Spaw, is a kind of alumino-nitrous Salt, or\nSal hermeticum.\u201d28 Much in the tradition of the past tradition of the\naerial nitre, Simpson proclaimed his salt was not common nitre, but\n\u201ctruly Magnetical of the Universal spirit\u201d a universal nitric acid.\n24\nMartin Lister, Dissertatio de Humoribus (London, 1709), Chapter XXVI, \u201cAn Sanguis\nFermentescit?

The basic conception of fermentation in chymistry was a\nbroad and common one, from the Latin fervere, to boil or ferment, referring to a substance changing its properties via an internal process as\nwell as to the action of leavening; the OED cites many examples from\nthe seventeenth century, in context with generation, vegetation, or\nputrefaction.29 Simpson\u2019s conception of fermentation however was more\nprecisely stated. In his Zymologia Physica (1675), Simpson took some\nof his ideas about fermentation from one of Sylvius\u2019s followers, Otto\nTachenius (still living in Venice in 1699). Tachenius, born in Westphalia,\nintroduced the principles of the Sylvius\u2019 acids and alkalis to Italy, and he\nprofessed to \u0003nd these acid-alkali principles in Hippocratic and Galenic\nwritings \u201cin which, he said, \u0003re=acid and water=alkali.\u201d30 Tachenius\nextended this theory to cover all natural phenomena. Simpson wrote\nin the preface to the Zymologia,\n. . . I began to look about me, and to consider on which of the Philosophers\nside I was . . . I could not tell of a good while, till at length I considered,\nthat the great Hypocrates himself has given touches thereof . . . viz . . . All\nthings are made of Fire and Water; and that these two are suf\u0003cient for all\ngenerations: so he adds, that Fire gives motion, and Water nutrition.31\nIn the margins next to this statement, both Tachenius and Hippocrates\nwere cited. For Simpson, Tachenius\u2019 and Hippocrates\u2019 ideas suggested to\nhim that the \u0003re \u201chid in bodies\u201d in the form of sulphur fermented with\nacidic saline spirits in water. Because Simpson was also a Helmontian,\nhe also believed that water was the source of all matter and material\nchange, and that\nFermentation in our sense, is the same with [Helmont\u2019s] Spiritus impetum\nfaciens . . . Fire hid in bodies, its also the same with that Aetherial matter,\nthe Panspermion of other abstruse Philosophers, that divinioris aurae particula\nimplanted by God in Water; which from seminal originals, produce, by\na genuine expansion, all concrete bodies; its likewise the same which the\nnoble Helmont calles semina rerum.32\n29\nBetty Jo Teeter Dobbs, \u201cNewton\u2019s Alchemy and His Theory of Matter,\u201d Isis 73,\n4 (Dec. 1982), pp. 511\u2013528, on p. 525.\n30\nPartington, History of Chemistry, vol II, p. 292.\n31\nSimpson, \u201cPreface,\u201d to Zymologia Physica (London: W.

Hot baths get their heat from fermentation of mineral juices, and\n\u201cthere is no hot bath without Sulphur.\u201d Hot baths differ in their\nqualities because of differences in their sulphurs.\n2. An acid colliding with sulphurs is required in all \u201cmineral fermentations\u201d or metallogenesis.\n3. Fire and light were due to the collision of acid and sulphur set into\nmotion by the air, which imbibes moisture. Volcanoes, earthquakes\nand lightening resulted from these collisions as well.\n4. The matter of animals, vegetables, and minerals differed due to a\nvariety of saline acids.\nIn discussing how spa waters were heated, Simpson began his analysis\nby addressing his inspiration, and to some degree, his opposition, namely\nTachenius. Though Simpson acknowledged that acids and alkalies\nmixed together could product ebullition and heat, he claimed it was\ndue primarily to acids meeting with \u201cthe Sulphur close bound up with\nthe Acid and Urinous Spirit or Salt in the Compages of the Alcali.\u201d36\nSimpson also claimed there was a greater variety and proportion of\n33\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 3.\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 5.\n35\nAntonio Clericuzio, Elements, Principles and Corpuscles: A Study of Atomism and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century (International Archives of the History of Ideas/Archives\ninternationales d\u2019histoire des id\u00e9es) (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2000), p. 154.\n36\nReview of Zymologia Chymica in Philosophical Transactions, 10, 117 (1675\u201376), pp.\n410\u2013416, on p. 414.\n34\n\nPages 135:\n118\nchapter four\ncorrosive acids within material bodies then lixivial alkalies, which he\nsaw as primarily created by the \u0003re rather than inherent to matter;\nhere, Simpson agreed with Van Helmont. Therefore,\nTachenius his Hypothesis of acids and alcalies, will not do our work, as\nbeing too narrow in the foundation to raise so large a structure of Philosophy upon, as genuinely to solve the various Phaenomena of nature,\nand particularly in this appearance of hot Baths.37\nSimpson \u0003rst argued that hot baths are sulphureous in nature by listing observations of natural philosophers about its presence in spas. He\nincluded Fallopius\u2019 accounts of baths in Padua, and the observations\nof Dr. Edward Browne, a fellow of the Royal Society, whose silver coat\nbuttons turned yellow near the baths at Baden due to its sulphureous\nemanations. Browne decided to do an experiment \u201changing money\nover the Bath at a distance, or at a greater, and found it colored in a\nminutes time, and that which was nearer in half a minute.\u201d38 Simpson\nthen discoursed upon the different sorts of Sulphurs that baths could\ncontain, such as antimony, bitumen, or vitriol, and he suggested that\nthe differences in their fermentative power produced \u201cdifferent degrees\nof heat in Baths.\u201d39 The location of the fermentation involving sulphur\nand acid also was important. The deeper in the earth it occurred, the\nmore precipitated the Sulphur became, \u201cleft in the colander or \u0003lter of\nSand, through which its passeth, and the acidum thereby so dinted as\nto become very Languid.\u201d40 Surface baths were thus more chemically\npotent and hotter then those below ground.\nThe fermentation process producing heat in the baths of course required\nspring water, and the transformation of sulphurous vitriol into oil of\nvitriol (sulphuric acid) via arti\u0003cial distillation or the natural mixture of\nvitriol and sulphur in spring water to produce oil of vitriol illustrated\nthis principle. If water was added again to oil of vitriol, a violent Fermentation occurred, the exothermic reaction producing violent heat.41\nCognizant of past work which made extensive claims for the generative\npower of salts alone, Simpson was quite \u0003rm in denying that dry salts\nalone or those \u201cmixed and sublimed together\u201d would produce any fer-\n37\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 8.\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 11.\n39\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 13.\n40\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 14.\n41\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 18.\n38\n\nPages 136:\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n119\nmentation or generative processes without moisture. Salts had to be in\nthe form of saline spirits or acids to have fermentative effect; powerful\nchemistry took place in solution whether in nature or in the laboratory,\nnot merely by the application of \u0003re.\nHaving showed that acid and sulphur were the chief ingredients of\nhot baths, Simpson then further wished to prove that their fermentation\nproduced the heat in the baths by performing a series of experiments\nin which he prepared the sulphur of antimony, a common chymical\noperation. The Paracelsian tria prima postulated that sulphur was one of\nthe elemental substances. By isolating it, chymical physicians believed\nthat it could serve as a potent medicine, and with proper chymical\nprocessing, sulphur could be free of side effects that often occurred in\nuncompounded substances.42 Isolating the sulphurs also was a means\nfor chymists such as Simpson to attain insights into elemental chymical\nreactions. Simpson did experiments mixing an infusion of aqua regia upon\nantimony, apparently following a method advocated by Angelus Sala\nin his Anatomia antimonii (1617). As Principe has noted, Sala\u2019s method\ntreated antimony with a strong acid. The acid was prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac and saltpeter in nitric acid, and distilling it. When\nantimony was combined with this strong acid, the chymist would see a\n\u201cvigorous effervescence\u201d which left an \u201cantimonial residue that is then\nto be extracted with a boiling solution (or lixivium) of salt of tartar. . . .\nThis extract is then evaporated to dryness, and the antimonial Sulphur\nsublimed thereupon.\u201d43 Indeed, in the Zymologia, Simpson wrote:\nin the affusion of Aqua Regis upon Antimony . . . where the acidum of the\nmenstruum acting upon and struggling with the crude sulphur of crude\nsolitary Antimony . . . doth cause a very strong Fermentation, where the\nSulphur by the assaults of those corrosive acid Spirits grows so high in\nits Fermentation, as that is almost takes \u0002ame, passing off with a strong\nsti\u0002ing and incoracible arsenical vapour, by the former of which prepared\nwith common Salt, my ingenious Friend Mr. Wilkinson and my self have\nafter Fermentation separated a Sulphur out of Antimony.44\nSimpson then went on to claim that the fermentation in this experiment\nis not \u201cfrom the salts in the sublimate (as some might urge), mixing with\nthe acidum in the menstruum,\u201d because \u201cthe same menstruum poured\nupon the same salts, while incorporated in the Mercury in the form\n42\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 101.\nNewman and Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, p. 102.\n44\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 30.\n43\n\nPages 137:\n120\nchapter four\nof Sublimate\u201d caused no fermentation.45 In other words, he is again\ndenying that salts alone are reactive enough to engender fermentation.\nIn his claim, Simpson also shows himself a true Helmontian. Helmont\nclaimed in his \u201cProgymnasma meteori,\u201d in his Ortus Humanum that acidic\ncorrosives, like the aqua regia in Sala\u2019s process, acted upon the sulphur\npresent in metals, driving it outward and freeing it from the Mercurial\npart \u201cwith which it had been associated and allowing the lixivium then\nto extract it.\u201d46 In Simpson\u2019s words, \u201cbut is it not rather the Sulphur\nin the metal, and the acidum of the menstruum, for the sake of which\nSulphur the mercurial part is also broken into pieces, and the whole\nby that Fermentative motion dissolv\u2019d.\u201d47\nThe incessant nature of metallogenesis via the fermentation of seeds\nin underground springs and caverns and the resultant heat that existed\nwithin the mines also was proof to Simpson that the heat of baths\nwas due to fermentation: \u201cfor where once begun, they [the minerals]\ncease not to perpetuate their offspring . . . the constant ef\u0002ux of waters\nkeeping the fermentative principles in constant motion\u201d48 Just as metals grew in the mines via fermentative processes producing \u201cmines so\nhot, they [the miners] can hardly touch them,\u201d so was the heat of the\nsprings produced.49 Simpson\u2019s idea was in direct contrast to Martin\nLister who as we saw in the last chapter, believed the vitriolic salt\nexposed to the air produced heat. Not surprisingly, Simpson postulated\nthat earthquakes and volcanoes resulted from the interaction of sulphur\nwith \u201ca fermenting acidum in the bowels of the Earth, in some narrow\npassages, where, when that elasticity and explosiveness of Sulphur by\na supervening acid is excited . . . forceth and presseth on all hand upon\nthe adjacent bulkes.\u201d50 Simpson\u2019s experiments mixing brimstone and\naqua regia were a close approximation to the processes he saw occurring\nunder the earth\u2019s surface. Simpson\u2019s idea that metallogenesis involved\nacids was also determined in the laboratory, as metals could be chymically analyzed and shown to have acids within them.

Simpson \u0003rst was hesitant to postulate\nabout the causes of \u201cheat and light in that great and inexhaustible Fountain thereof, the Sun,\u201d as it may have a \u201cparticular Fermentation of its\nown, set a work by the divine Fiat.\u201d52 Aiming for more humble ends, he\ndecided to analyze \u201cthat which is most obvious, viz. culinary \u0003re and\nthen examine how Light is produced therefrom.\u201d53 He believed that acid\nand sulphur inherent in any combustible substance were worked upon\nby the air. Much as Simpson claimed dry salts mixed together would\nnot chemically react with each other without the addition of water, he\nclaimed the moisture of the Air was necessary for \u201cignition and \u0002agration\u201d of substances.54 Here, Simpson may have been in\u0002uenced by\nBoyle, whom he cited in several instances in the Zymologia, particularly\nBoyle\u2019s discussion of light in the case of a diamond that shone in the\ndark. Boyle speculated that \u201call shining substances depended upon air\nto some extent and speculated that the air had a role in producing the\nagitation that generates light.\u201d55 Due to its \u201cspongy nature,\u201d Simpson\nspeculated that air imbibed moisture,\nwheeling off from other bodies in their incessant Fermentation, and\nthereby becomes quali\u0003ed for keeping other Fermentations afoot, and then\nby its other quality of penetration . . . it becomes truly capable of assisting\nthe principles of Acidum and Sulphur in their furious combating.56\nAfter the moisture insinuated itself in the acid and sulphur particles and\ncombustion occurred, there would be left some ashes in which there\n51\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 25.\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 48.\n53\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 108.\n54\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 109.\n55\nGolinski, \u201cPhosphorus and the Royal Society,\u201d Isis, p. 22.\n56\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 109.\n52\n\nPages 139:\n122\nchapter four\nwas some salt, but eventually all things combusted were reduced to\nwater. Simpson wrote,\nAnd although Fire moistens no bodies put thereto, yet doth it really go\noff, not only in a liquid, but humid form, witness the condenc\u2019d steam of\nmineral Sulphur, or Brimstone, burning under a Glass campane (distillation apparatus) is sav\u2019d in an acid Liquor, also Spirit of Wine, \u0003red and\ncondensed by such an arti\u0003ce, appears in an insipid water.57\nAgain, in his return to a water principle, Simpson shows the basis of\nhis work is Van Helmontian.\nFrom these observations, Simpson concluded that rapid fermentation\nbetween acid and sulphur, with air, produced \u0003re, and \u201c\u0003re of ignition\ngives Light by a continual winding off in luminous rays.\u201d58 His study of\noptics convinced Simpson that light makes its exit in right lines from\n\u201cthe source of their Fermentative motion.\u201d59 According to his scheme,\nthe light then would collide with water atoms in the atmosphere. This\ncollision between light and atmospheric moisture meant the light was\ntaken from its 90 degree path, and became refracted, re\u0002ected, and\nmultiplied which produced the diaphanous quality of \u0003re and accounted\nfor the illuminating property of \u0002ames. The acid of steel and the\nsulphur in \u0002ints or pyrites when struck also \u201cset into a rapid Fermentation whence ariseth \u0003re.\u201d60 Just as \u0002int struck steel to make sparks,\nlightening was caused by the falling of one cloud upon another, each\ncloud containing acids and sulphurs which collided and produced the\nsudden \u0002ash. Simpson\u2019s theory was a modi\u0003cation of Martin Lister\u2019s\nmechanism which solely involved the volatile and sulphureous exhalations of pyrites; in Simpson\u2019s theory, acids were a necessity.\nSimpson believed a similar mechanism was behind a variety of other\nnatural phenomena, including static electricity (due to fermentation of\nthe acids and \u201chighly volatilized\u201d sulphurs in the animal spirits interacting with the moisture in the atmosphere), the shining light arising from\nrotting wood or \u0003sh, and the production of luminous meteors.

Tachenius in his Hippocrates\nChimicus (1666) claimed that no fermentation, creation or decay of\nanimals and plants could occur without acids.63 Olaus Borrichius in his\nDe Hermetica Aegyptiorum vetere et Paracelsiorum Nova Medicina (Helmstadt,\n1648), likewise stated that acids and sulphurs formed an intrinsic part\nof all animals.\nAcids were thus claimed to be differently composed to make up the\nmodi\u0003cations of bodies, and classi\u0003ed as actively fermenting and \u0002uid,\nor passive and consistent of matter: \u201cFrom which succlency of Acids\ntogether with intermediate coagulations and hardenings, perform\u2019d at\ndue seasons, all concrete bodies in the threefold Kingdoms of nature are\nproduc\u2019d.\u201d64 As an example, Simpson showed how acids and sulphurs\naccounted for plant growth.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 118 to 140 of the document. The text covers the following key ideas:

1. <strong>Van Helmont’s Salts and Plant Respiration</strong>: The role of salts in the taste and chemical properties of plants is explored, with insights from <strong>Nehemiah Grew</strong> (1641–1712). He proposed that salts within plants, such as nitrous salts, influenced plant flavors and interactions with air. This section also includes experiments on the solubility of salts and their impact on plant physiology [Grew, *Anatomy of Plants*, 1675, p. 118](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=118).

2. <strong>Experiments with Salts and Water</strong>: Grew performed experiments on dissolving salts in water, discovering that different salts had varying solubilities. His work led to conclusions about the atomic structure of salts and their unique interactions with water [p. 119](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=119).

3. <strong>Barometric Pressure and Salts</strong>: Grew also explored how saline bodies affected atmospheric pressure and barometric readings, proposing that nitrous salts in the air contributed to changes in weather phenomena, like thunderstorms [p. 121](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=121).

Acids were also the\ncause of tumors, which were \u201cswellings from acids of some badly cured\nDisease\u201d producing \u201cspurious ferment\u201d as well as gall stones, \u201csulphureous parts bound up by the vinculum of an acid.\u201d67 Again, Simpson\nwas departing from Paracelsian chymistry which postulated gall stones\nwere concreted salts. Rather all salts such as \u201csal marine, vitriol, alum\u201d\nwere \u201cconcreted acid juices.\u201d68\nSimpson and Newton\nSimpson\u2019s search for a vital agent in the process of fermentation, as\nwell as his assertions about acids and sulphurs in the Zymologia has some\nstriking parallels with Newton\u2019s thought.69 In his early 1670s manuscript,\n\u201cOn the Vegetation of Metals,\u201d Newton discoursed about the role of a\nsubtle active matter and the fermentation of vital processes in nature:\n\u201cThis is the subtle spirit. This is Natures universall agent, her secret \u0003re,\nye onely ferment &amp; principle of all vegetation. The material soule of\nall matter . . .\u201d70 Newton echoed this premise again in the Portsmouth\nmanuscripts, where he claimed that ferments were \u201cthe true parents of\nall forms.\u201d71 When discussing the forces that moved matter in the last\nQuery in the Opticks, Newton classi\u0003ed them as inertia, gravity, cohesion\nof bodies, and \u201cactive principles\u201d which \u201ccauses Fermentation\u201d ranking\nthem all as \u201coccult qualities\u201d who principles should be discovered \u201cto\n66\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 139.\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 140.\n68\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 140.\n69\nPartington in his entry on Simpson also notes the similarities.

As Mandelbrote has stated, Newton\u2019s annotations drew on\nhis wide reading in alchemy, which would have made Newton realize\nthe analogy between chemical reactions and distillations to make wine\nand beer. In December 1692, Newton\u2019s notes began with an account\nof the production and virtue of barm, which was a fermenting malt\nliquor. Newton subsequently noted that via the process of fermentation, \u201cmetals could be made ready for transmutation.\u201d74 Debus has also\nremarked upon Newton\u2019s preoccupation with fermentation, postulating\n72\nSir Isaac Newton, Opticks, or a Treatise of the Re\u0003ections, Refractions, In\u0003ections and\nColors of Light based on the Fourth Edition London, 1730 (New York: Dover Publications,\nInc., 1979), Book III, Part One, p. 401.\n73\nRichard Westfall, \u201cIsaac Newton\u2019s Index Chemicus,\u201d Ambix 22 (1975), pp. 174\u201385.\nThe author recognizes the historiographic controversy surrounding the sources of\nNewton\u2019s chymical musings, as well as the exact nature of his debt to alchemy, but\nNewton\u2019s belief in the importance of atmospheric acids is self-evident. Michael\nSendivogius\u2019 (1566\u20131636) Novum Lumen Chymicum (1604), which had over thirty editions\nprinted until the end of the eighteenth century, identi\u0003ed the importance of nitre and\nnitric acid\u2019s presence in the air for respiration and its use as a universal fertilizer and\nprinciple of life. Sendivogius believed that nitre acted \u201clike calcined tartar (anhydrous\npotassium carbonate) in attracting fertilizing humidity\u201d into the soil from the heavens\ncelestial rays; In 1674, John Mayow (1640\u20131679) in his Tractatus Quinque Medico-Physici,\nclaimed that air was composed of a \u201csmall proportion of highly reactive particles\nwhich he identi\u0003ed as a nitro-aerial spirit.\u201d Like oxygen, \u201cthese particles alone made\nair suitable for respiration, and when absorbed through the lungs they imparted the\nbright red color to arterial blood; the nitro-aerial particles explained the necessity of\nair for combustion.\u201d See Henry Guerlac, \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Nitre,\u201d Isis 45, 3 (September\n1954), pp. 243\u2013255, on p. 243.\n74\nScott Mandelbrote, \u201cMaking Sense of Motion,\u201d in Footprints of the Lion, exhibition\nat Cambridge University Library, http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Exhibitions/Footprints_\nof_the_Lion/ p. 40. Accessed 20 November 2006. Figala and Petzold have also noted\nthat in 1701/2 Newton purchased a wide variety of French alchemical works, including\nworks by Duchesne which concerned fermentation. Newton also was in correspondence\nwith Y-Worth, including helping him with the writing of the Processus mysterii magni philosophicus, which later became published as Mercury\u2019s Caducean Rod. See Karin Figala and\nUlrich Petzold, \u201cAlchemy in the Newtonian Circle,\u201d Renaissance and Revolution: Humanists,\nScholars, Craftsmen, and Natural Philosophers in Early Modern Europe ed.

Certainly in query 31 of the 1717\nOpticks, Newton \u201clinked active principles with the \u2018great and violent\u2019\nprocesses of chymistry, questioning the reducibility of chemistry to\nthe passive Laws of Motion.\u201d76 In query 31, Newton claimed in a\nmechanism quite reminiscent of Simpson\u2019s discussion of meteorology\nin the Zymologia that\nsome sulphureous steams . . . ascending into the air, ferment there with\nnitrous acids, and sometimes taking \u0003re cause lightening and thunder,\nand \u0003ery meteors. For the air abounds with acid vapours \u0003t to promote\nfermentation. . . . in Fermentations the Particles of Bodies which almost\nrest, are put into new Motions by a very potent Principle, which acts upon\nthem only when they approach one another, and causes them to meet\nand clash with great violence, and grow hot with the motion, and dash\none another to pieces, and vanish into Air, and Vapour, and Flame.77\nQuery 8 in the Opticks also asked, \u201cand do not all Bodies which abound\nwith terrestrial parts, and especially with sulphureous ones, emit Light\nas often as those parts are suf\u0003ciently agitated?\u201d78\nNewton also wrote the De Natura acidorum in 1692, which was sent\nto the physician Archibald Pitcairne and published by John Harris in\nthe Lexicon Technicum: A Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1704\u201310).\nAcids in Newton\u2019s scheme were in size larger than water molecules, but\nsmaller than earthy ones, and were endowed with a \u201cgreat attractive\nforce.\u201d79 As the acids rushed \u201ctowards the Particles of bodies,\u201d they\n75\nAllen Debus, \u201cMotion in Renaissance Chemistry,\u201d Isis 64, 1 (March 1973), pp.\n4\u201317, on p. 15.\n76\nP.M.

Newton also postulated\nthat acids were also crucial components of sulphurs and fats; because\nacids were of such attractive qualities, they were \u201cclosely retain\u2019d\u201d by\nother particles when mixed with them, \u201cquite suppressed and hidden\nas it were by them; so that they neither stimulate the organ of sense,\nnor attract water, but compose Bodies which are not Acid ie Fat and\nFusible Bodies.\u201d81 The attractive force in these suppressed acid particles\n\u201cin sulphureous bodies\u201d accounted for their in\u0002ammable nature; when\nsulphurs met with other materials, the acids within it \u201cby more strongly\nattracting the Particles of other Bodies (earthly ones for Instance) than\nits own, promotes a gentle Fermentation, produces and cherishes Natural\nHeat, and carries it on . . .\u201d82 Clearly for Newton and for Simpson,\nacids and sulphurs were behind fermentation.\nNewton then postulated that if the fermentation progressed to its\nultimate end, the compound putre\u0003ed, and a new mixture or compound\nwas created; as he expressed in the Opticks, nature \u201cseems delighted with\ntransmutations.\u201d83 In the Propositions in the Burndy MS 16, Newton\nalso asserted that \u201cNothing can be changed from what it is without\nputrefaction . . . nothing can be generated or nourished (but of putri\u0003ed\nmatter).\u201d84 Newton therefore believed that acids with their sulphurs\nwere behind organic creation and decay. Simpson likewise when discussing the putrefaction of animals in the Zymologia stated that when\nthe principles of acid and sulphur in the animal tissue interacted with\nthe air and underwent a\nputrefactive Fermentation, the sulphur by those retrograde motions,\nbecome more volatilized and by gentle touches from its inbred Acid,\nwinds off in a luminous \u0002ame . . . to which may be added, that in their\nputrefactive reductions, a mucilage be made to appear, which is the\nreceptacle, as it were sperme . . .85\n80\nNewton, \u201cDe Natura Acidorum,\u201d p.

Van Helmont had\nalso suggested that bird\u2019s eggs putri\u0003ed before the formation of a chick\nand \u201clife is in those putri\u0003ed things.\u201d86\nSimpson postulated that the putrefying matter could also emit light,\nas in the case of rotting \u0003sh. This is also reminiscent of Newtonian\nthought. As Dobbs stated, Newton believed:\nIn rarefaction . . . fermentation worked against the force of cohesion,\nagitating the particles so violently that they broke away from the control\nof the cohesive force and came under the in\u0002uence of the force of repulsion. In processes of solution, for example, when particles rush together\nso violently that they grow hot, the . . . large composite particles of \u201cair,\nvapours, and exhalations\u201d may be expelled, or very small particles given\noff as light. Putrid vapours may likewise \u201cshine from the agitation due\nto putrefaction.\u201d87\nIn the only surviving letter Newton wrote to Robert Boyle, composed\non 28 February 1679, Newton further speculated the role that acids had\nin the density and af\u0003nity of matter.88 The letter opens with Newton\u2019s\nspeculations on the aether, a rari\u0003ed substance like air. The aether was\nmore subtle than air, was \u201ccapable of contraction and dilation\u201d and\n\u201cstrongly elastic.\u201d Not only did the \u201cintermingling of rarer with denser\naether at the edges of opaque bodies\u201d allow Newton to explain the\nrefraction of light, but he also thought it \u201cmight explain the attraction\nand repulsion between bodies,\u201d as well as chemical reactions.89\nThe aether pervaded all bodies, \u201cbut yet so as to land rare in their\npores then in free spaces, and so much the rarer, as their pores are less.\u201d90\nHis evidence for this assertion was that when objects were placed in a\nvacuum, only the aether remained, accounting for such phenomena as\nthe cohesion of two pieces of metals or marble discs in a vacuum; the\n\u0003ne aether in the pores of the metals or marble produced an attractive\nforce. And, the further one went to the interior of bodies, the rarer\nthe aether became, as it was more and more dif\u0003cult for the aether to\n86\nVan Helmont, \u201cImage of Ferments,\u201d Van Helmont\u2019s Works, p. 113.\nDobbs, \u201cNewton\u2019s Alchemy,\u201d p. 525.\n88\nIsaac Newton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, ed.

As the aether became rarer as the two bodies were almost\ntouching, they began to repel each other, \u201cbecause thereby they cause the\ninterjacent aether to rarefy more and more.\u201d92 As Newton explained,\nBut at length when they come so near together that the excess of pressure of the external aether which surrounds the bodies, above that of\nthe rare\u0003ed aether, which is between them, is so great as to overcome\nthe reluctance which the bodies have from being brought together, then\nwill that excess of pressure drive them with violence together, and make\nthem adhere stronger to each other.93\nThe rate of cohesion or repulsion, or chymically, the relative volatility\nand \u0003xedness of material bodies depended on a few other factors. First,\nthe sizes of matter particles determined their volatility, as greater heat or\nforce would be necessary to dissolve larger particles than smaller ones.\nSecond, the degree which the aether in the particles was rari\u0003ed determined volatility. If one had a really small particle, aether on its outside\ncould get in from all sides more easily, so there was not as much aether\ngradient between the interior and exterior of the particle. Larger particles had a more pronounced aether gradient, as aether on the exterior\nof the particle could not get to its interior as easily; the interior of large\nparticles were therefore more rari\u0003ed.\nFrom these speculations, Newton concluded\nthis may be the reason they why the small particles of vapours easily come\ntogether and are reduced back into water unless that which keeps them\nin agitation be so great as to dissipate them as fast they come together:\nbut the grosser particles of exhalations raised by fermentation keep their\naerial form more obstinately, because the aether within them is rarer.94\nIn the Hypotheses of Light, Newton asserted an \u201caetherial spirit may be\ncondensed in fermenting bodies.\u201d95 He also speculated that \u201ctrue permanent air\u201d or the heavier air in the atmosphere may be due to the\n92\nNewton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 1\u201310, on p. 4.\n93\nNewton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 1\u201310, on p. 4.\n94\nNewton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 1\u201310, on p. 9.\n95\nNewton, \u201cAn Hypothesis explaining the Properties of Light,\u201d The History of the\nRoyal Society by Thomas Birch (London, 1757), vol. 3, pp. 247\u2013305, on p. 251.\n\nPages 148:\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n131\n\u201cmetallic exhalations raised in the bowels of the earth by the action\nof acid menstruums,\u201d as metals were the densest of substances.96 The\nheavy air released by metallic fermentation \u201cbetrayed its ponderosity by\nmaking vapours ascend readily in it, but sustaining mist and clouds of\nsnow, and buoying up gross and ponderous smoke.\u201d97 Simpson in the\nZymologia also had postulated that the more brisk fermentation occurred,\nthe more dense the aerial products they produced; the variability of\nfermentation thus accounted for the different components of and effects\nin the atmosphere. Some of these acid-sulphur fermentations he believed\nwere visible as \u201csteams\u201d a little after sun rise, \u201cthe eye being somewhat\nelevated above the level of the ground.\u201d98 Both natural philosophers\ncertainly agreed that fermentation in the atmosphere produced components of the air with different densities.\nNewtonian physicians and saline spirits\nSimpson\u2019s and hence Newton\u2019s emphases on the role of saline spirits or\nacids in chymical processes also affected early modern medical and physiological theories and applications. This was particularly the case among\nthe Newtonian Physicians, a group of medical practitioners identi\u0003ed\nby Theodore Brown and Anita Guerrini. These physicians were primarily active between 1687 (publication of Newton\u2019s Principia) and 1713,\nthough there were still doctors utilizing Newtonian theory, such as Irish\nphysician Bryan Robinson, until the mid-eighteenth century.99 Scottish\nphysicians David Gregory (1659\u20131708), who became the Savilian chair of\nastronomy of Oxford, and Archibald Pitcairne (1652\u20131713), who was\nthe chair of medicine at Leyden, sought Newton\u2019s patronage and utilized his work to interpret human physiology. Pitcairne\u2019s students included Richard Mead (1673\u20131754) and George Cheyne (1671\u20131743),\nand Gregory\u2019s pupils James and John Keill and the English physician\n96\nNewton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 1\u201310, on p. 10.\n97\nNewton, \u201cCorrespondence with Robert Boyle, 1679,\u201d Isaac Newton: Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 1\u201310, on p. 10.\n98\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 122.\n99\nGuerrini, \u201cArchibald Pitcairne and Newtonian Medicine\u201d; Guerrini, \u201cThe Tory\nNewtonians: Gregory, Pitcairne, and their Circle\u201d; Theodore Brown, \u201cMedicine in the\nShadow of the Principia.\u201d Journal of the History of Ideas, 48 (1987), pp. 629\u201348.\n\nPages 149:\n132\nchapter four\nJohn Friend. These doctors also applied Newtonian theory to the\neffects of gravity on the body, or used calculus or geometry to interpret\nthe mechanics of \u0002uids through bodily vessels, along with analysis of\nattractions between matter.\nSome of the Newtonian physicians, such as Pitcairne, concentrated\non Newtonian \u201ciatromathematics\u201d applying purely mechanistic explanations from Newton\u2019s theory of matter in the Principia and De natura\nacidorum to human physiology. Pitcairne in particular concentrated\nupon \u201cthe analogy of the microcosm to the macrocosm, the possibility of limitless transmutation, and the inertness of matter, which was\nindependent of force and activity.\u201d100 As Guerrini has shown, Pitcairne\ndiscounted any explanation of the Helmontian iatrochymists, particularly any explanation which involved chemical ferments or short-range\nattractions between particles.101 Pitcairne thought that the size of particles, not their shapes, was the important consideration in a theory of\nsecretion and medical treatments; \u201cbodily secretions were classi\u0003ed into\ngrosser and thinner \u0002uids which passed through appropriately sized\nbodily ori\u0003ces.\u201d102 Proper circulation, and the pressure and secretion\nof \u0002uids in the vessels\u2014all \u201cmechanical, mathematizable . . . observable\nentities\u201d\u2014were the bases of health.103\nAs he wished to concentrate on observable entities, Pitcairne rejected\nNewton\u2019s explanation for heat of the blood involving fermentation. In\nthe Opticks, Newton noted, \u201cthe cause of fermentation . . . is an acid, by\nwhich the heart and blood of Animals are kept in Perpetual Motion and\nHeat.\u201d104 In a letter to the iatromechanical physician Archibald Pitcairne\n(1652\u20131713), Newton also noted that that \u201csulphur seems to be what is\ndeposited on the lungs from the air, and what is supplied from the air to\nmaintain \u0003re seems to be the same.\u201d105 In the de Natura Acidorum, Newton\nthen remarked that when alchemists said \u201csulphur,\u201d \u201cby sulphur they\n100\nAnita Guerrini, \u201cArchibald Pitcairne,\u201d p. 74.\nGuerrini, \u201cIsaac Newton, George Cheyne and the \u201cPrincipia Medicinae,\u201d The\nmedical revolution of the seventeenth century, ed.

Animal heat was also\n. . . dependent upon the motion of the heart. As in much of Pitcairne\u2019s\nwork, the underlying metaphor came from astronomy: the heart causes\nlife . . . by its beat, as the sun causes motion in the universe via its\ngravity. He drew an analogy between gravity and the heartbeat, not as\nNewton had in De natura acidorum, between gravity and local short-range\nattractions.107\nPitcairne in his rigidly mechanistic account however was an exception\nin the circle of the Newtonian physicians, most of who were interested\nin fermentations of acidic saline spirits in bodily processes and did\nconsider the shapes of saline particles and their reactions in the body.\nThe Newtonian physician George Cheyne in his treatise of gout (1720)\ntraditionally attributed this malady to \u201cthe abundance of tartarous,\nurinous, or other salts, introduced into the Blood by the Food.\u201d108 Treatment could be by modifying diet to lessen the quantity of the salts,\nincreased exercise to expel salts in perspiration, or taking sulphureous\nmedicine. The sulphur which was \u201csmall and active\u201d would unite and\ndulcify the salts, \u201cespecially those of the acid kind,\u201d destroying their\nef\u0003cacy.109 Newton had discoursed in the Opticks about the permanency\nof salts, and in the De Natura Acidorum how the \u201cAcid that lies suppress\u2019d\nin sulphureous Bodies, by more strongly attracting the Particles of other\nBodies . . . promotes a gentle Fermentation . . . and carries on . . . to the\nPutrefaction of the Compound.\u201d110\nNewton also noted in the De Natura Acidorum how saline spirits or acids\n\u201ctore\u201d into the tongue or any \u201cexcoriated Part of the Body\u201d causing\na painful Sensation.111 Cheyne\u2019s The English Malady (1753) concerning\nnervous disorders likewise devoted an entire chapter to the \u201ceffects of\n106\nNewton, De Natura Acidorum, fol E2 verso.

In his \u0003rst iatromechanical\nwork, A Mechanical Account of Poisons (1702), he argued that the nervous\nspirits or animal \u0002uids of the body that were the most susceptible to\npoison were made of a \u201cuniversal elastic matter\u201d \u0003rst postulated by \u201cour\ngreat philosopher, Sir Isaac Newton,\u201d referring the reader to queries\n23 and 24 or the Optics.114\nIn a separate essay on \u201cVenomous Exhalations\u201d in the Mechanical\nAccount, Mead speculated upon a \u201cvivifying matter from the air, which\npasses into the blood by the breath,\u201d and the effects upon this substance\nof subterranean emanations from \u201cla Grotta de Cani,\u201d a Neopolitan\ncave which emanated a \u201cthin, subtile warm fume\u201d which asphyxiated\npassers-by.115 The fume was a greenish color, leading Mead to postulate\nthat it was the \u201cphlegm of vitriol\u201d or sulphuric acid \u201craised by a subterraneous heat.\u201d116 He clamed that the acidic particles, quite in contrast\nto Newton\u2019s role for acids, had a \u201ccounteraction or repulsive force to\nthe elastic matter\u201d of the animal spirits causing it to lose its force in\nthe body. Mead continued:\nNeither must it seem strange, that the animal spirits should be so suddenly\ninterrupted in their action by the interposition of a ponderous \u0002uid, since\nwe see every day how instantaneously, on the other hand, their motion\nis quickened and revived by the application, to the nostrils of volatile\nsalts, and it may be observed, that these are always alkaline, that is, of a\n112\nGeorge Cheyne, The English Malady, ed.

The basic tenets of Sylvius\u2019 theories were that effervescence was typical of physiology, and everything, including the bodily\nhumors, had acidic and basic qualities in addition to their cold, hot,\nmoist, and dry attributes.118 For instance, Sylvius compared the blood\u2019s\neffervescence with the reaction between acids and alkalis, and claimed\nthat \u201c[i]nspiration serves to temper this process by giving access\u201d to a\nvolatile salt in the air into the blood.119 Sylvius in particular believed\nthat \u201cacrimonious in\u0002uences were ascribed to speci\u0003c \u0002uids,\u201d including\nthe lymph and that \u201ccharacteristic diseases resulted from their acidic\nor alkaline natures.\u201d120 Too acidic conditions or alkaline conditions in\nbodily \u0002uids caused disease, a state to be countered with appropriate\nbasic or acidic medicaments to restore the balance of the humors.121\nHarold Cook has shown the simplistic division of all chymical substances\ninto acids and alkalis made this theory an extremely popular and often\nmisused medical treatment among the populace in the United Kingdom\nin the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.122\nMead also was not above using trendy vocabulary to boost his medical\npractice. As he later rather cynically advised another young physician,\nTimothy Vanbustle:\nShould you have an itching to make your name known by writing a book\non physic, yet so customary, I will advise you to choose the subject by\nwhich you think you will get most money, or that will bring you the most\ngeneral business . . . The method of writing, if in your frontispiece you\naddress not your book to some great man, is to club with some other\nphysicians; and thus by way of letters to commend each other\u2019s good\n117\nMead, A Mechanical Account of Poisons, p. 103.\nMarie Boas Hall, \u201cAcid and Alkali in Seventeenth-Century Chemistry,\u201d Archives\ninternationales d\u2019historie des sciences, 1956, 34: 13\u201328; Harold Cook, Trials of an Ordinary\nDoctor: Joannes Groenevelt in Seventeenth-Century London (Baltimore: John Hopkins University\nPress, 1994), p. 66.\n119\nSylvius [Franciscus de la B\u00f6e], Sylvii Opera medica tam hactenus inedita (A,sterdam:\nD.

In 1732, Robinson (1680\u2013\n1754) wrote his Treatise of the Animal Oeconomy, a work of physiological\nmechanism.125 Past scholarly analysis of the Oeconomy has portrayed\nRobinson\u2019s work in the context of two intellectual in\u0002uences\u2014\u0003rst,\nLeiden physician Herman Boerhaave\u2019s (1668\u20131738) emphasis on the\nhydraulics of bodily \u0002uids through the veins and arteries, as well his study\nof solids and their \u0003bers whose faults caused distempers, and second,\na \u201cNewtonian physiology\u201d based on the queries on ether in Newton\u2019s\nOpticks.126 Robinson particularly attributed the \u201cmotion of muscles\nto the vibration of an ethereal \u0002uid pervading the animal body.\u201d127\nHeimann also noted how Robinson\u2019s Dissertation on the aether of Sir Isaac\n123\nJohn Nichols, Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century . . .

Robinson\npostulated that Newton\u2019s aether was permeated with \u201cacidic parts of\nthe air.\u201d134 These acids were necessary to respiration, \u201cpreserved the\nlife of animals,\u201d and his discussion demonstrated that Robinson had a\n\u201cglimmering of the nature\u201d of oxygen\u2019s role in respiration.135 Robinson stated in the twenty-fourth proposition of his Animal Oeconomy that\n\u201c[t]he life of animals is preserved by acid Parts of the Air, mixing with\nthe Blood in the Lungs: which parts dissolve or attenuate the Blood,\nand preserve its Heat; and by both these, keep up the Motion of the\nHeart.\u201d136 Robinson \u0003rst noted from the results of Robert Hooke\u2019s\n(1635\u20131703) air pump experiments that a constant supply of fresh\nair is necessary to preserve the Life of Animals, as well as to preserve\n\u201csulphureous and unctuous Substances when once they are kindled.\u201d137\nHe then referred to a chymical experiment done by physician Olaus\nBorrichius (1626\u20131690) in which spirit of nitre (nitric acid or HNO3)\nwas added to the unctuous oil of cloves (mostly eugenol C10H12O2), an\nexothermic reaction that results in the production of oxalic acid and\n\u201cin a burning \u0002ame\u201d that remained present even in a vacuum. Similar\nexperiments in which sulphur and nitric acid were mixed together and\nkindled, resulted in them burning \u201cunder Water, or in vacuo, as well\nas in the open Air.\u201d138 Robinson then concluded that \u0003re and \u0002ame\n\u201cmay both be produced and preserved in sulphureous and unctuous\nSubstances by acid Particles even without Air,\u201d and thus, \u201cthat Air\n132\nThe Dictionary of Eighteenth-Century British Philosophers, s.v. \u201cRobinson Bryan\n(1680\u20131754).\u201d Thackeray notes how Harris even \u201ccorrected the sheets\u201d to the Conic\nSections.

A similar experiment was done by Boyle\nand Mayow in which they burned gunpowder under water. For a short discussion of\nRobinson\u2019s intellectual sources, see J.R. Parthington, \u201cSome Early Appraisals of the\nWork of John Mayow,\u201d Isis 50 (1959), pp. 211\u201326, esp. pp. 224\u201325.\n\nPages 157:\n140\nchapter four\npreserves Fire and Flame by means of acid Particles.\u201d139 Therefore, in\na neat syllogism, acid particles preserved the life of animals, as they\npreserved \u0002ame in vacuo.\nBut how would Robinson prove his Proposition that acid particles\nin the air were the chymical source of respiration? Noting past experiments by Dr. Richard Lower (1631\u20131691), Robinson realized that venal\nblood was deeper purple, and when exposed to air would turn bright\nred.140 Robinson concluded that the acid parts of the air caused this\nchange, and therefore there must be a \u201clike contact of these acid parts\nwith the blood in the lung.\u201d141 Ergo, \u201cthe life of animals is preserved by\nacid parts of the air mixing with the blood in the lungs.\u201d142\nRobinson then turned to Newton\u2019s Opticks to explain in more detail\nthe chymical interaction of the acid in the air with the blood, drawing\nupon Newton\u2019s work on color and chymistry. Robinson noted that:\nthe bright red Color acquired by the Blood in the Lungs, from its Purity\nand Intenseness, is the Red of the second Order of Colors in the Table\nof Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Opticks, p. 206. But the blackish or deep purple\nColor of Venal Blood turns into this bright Red, without passing through\nthe Colors of Blue, Green, Yellow, and Orange; and therefore, must\narise from the indigo and Purple of the third Order, and not from the\nIndigo and Violet of the second. And consequently by that Table, the\ntinging Corpuscles of the Blood are lessened in the Lungs. Hence it\nappears, that the acid parts of the Air dissolve or attenuate the Blood\nin the Lungs.143\nWhat was this table referred to in the Opticks, and how did Robinson\ncome to this conclusion?\nIn the Opticks, Newton attempted to \u0003nd the sizes of the corpuscles\nof light that made up different colors in the spectrum with his experiments placing a plano-convex lens on a \u0002at glass surface, producing\n\u201cNewton\u2019s rings\u201d or colored and concentric interference rings seen when\nilluminated from above with monochromatic light. Although Newton\nbelieved in a corpuscular theory of light, Newton\u2019s rings result from the\ninterference between rays re\u0002ected by the top and bottom surfaces of\n139\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 195.\nRichard Lower, Tractatus de corde item de motu et colore sanguinis et chyli in eum transitu\n(London: J. Allestry, 1669), pp. 164\u201365. For an older, but still useful overview of respiratory theory, see Leonard G. Wilson, \u201cThe Transformation of Ancient Theories of\nRespiration in the Seventeenth Century,\u201d Isis 51 (1960), pp. 161\u201372.\n141\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 198.\n142\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 198.\n143\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 198\u201399.\n140\n\nPages 158:\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n141\nthe air gap between the two pieces of glass. Because the gap (equivalent\nto a thin \u0003lm) increases in width from the central contact point out\nto the edges, the extra path length of the lower ray varies, and corresponds to constructive and destructive interference, which gives rise to\nthe series of bright and dark rings of color. After carefully measuring,\nNewton realized the thickness of this \u0003lm of air between the lens and\nthe glass corresponded to the spacing of the rings.144 He also realized\nthat the quantity of light re\u0002ected from the rings was \u201cmost copious\nfrom the \u0003rst or inmost, and in the exterior Rings became gradually less\nand less;\u201d in other words as Alan Shapiro has observed, Newton realized there was a periodicity in the intensity of the several colors into\nwhich he divided visible light.145 Newton subsequently ordered the\nintensity of the colored rings he saw, composing a table, \u201cwherein\nthe thickness of Air, Water, and Glass, at which each Color is most\nintense and speci\u0003c, is expressed in parts of an Inch divided into ten\nhundred thousand equal parts.\u201d146 This is the table to which Robinson\nreferred [Figure 9].\nAs Shapiro has noted, Newton also believed that the \u201ccorpuscles\nof bodies produce colors just as a thin \u0003lm or air gap of the same\nthickness and density does.\u201d147 Newton wrote,\nThe transparent part of bodies according to their several sizes must re\u0002ect\nrays of one color and transmit those of another, on the same grounds\nthat thin plates does re\u0002ect or transmit those rays. And this I take to be\nthe ground of all their colors. The parts of Bodies on which their colors\ndepend are denser than the Medium wch pervades their interstices.148\nAs Newton concluded in the Opticks, \u201cthe bigness of the parts of natural Bodies may be conjectured by their Colors.\u201d149 In other words, as\nShapiro has commented,\nall bodies are composed of invisible, transparent corpuscles that are\nin effect tiny fragments of a thin \u0003lm that produces the identical color in\n144\nSee Alan Shapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms: Physics, Method, and Chemistry and\nNewton\u2019s Theories of Colored Bodies and Fits of Easy Re\u0003ection (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), esp. ch. 2, \u201cNewton\u2019s Rings,\u201d for details on Newton\u2019s method.\n145\nNewton, Opticks, Book II, Part I, p. 222; Shapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms,\np. 117.\n146\nNewton, Opticks, Book II, Part II, p. 232.\n147\nShapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms, p. 117.\n148\nThomas Birch, The History of the Royal Society of London for Improving of Natural\nKnowledge. 4 vols.

If the corpuscles were of the same optical density as\nwater or glass . . . their size was found from the color of the body by the table\nhe composed that gives the thickness of a \u0003lm producing that color.150\nBut Newton found it was dif\u0003cult to know of what order the color of\nany body was, and it had to be done by comparing the color of the\nbody with those observed in Newton\u2019s rings. Newton subsequently\nanalyzed the qualities of the various orders of each color, concluding from his table for example that blues and violets are the \u201cbest\u201d\nor most intense in the third order.151 As Shapiro remarked, Newton\nsupported his evidence with chymical experiments, using a chymical\nindicator test for acids and alkalis that he had learned from Boyle using\nthe syrup of violets.152 Newton wrote\nThus the color of violets seems to be of that [third] order, because their\nSyrup by acid liquors turnes red and by . . . alcalizate turns green. For\nsince it is the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate . . . if the purple\ncolor of ye Syrup was of the second order, a acid liquor by attenuating\nits tinging corpuscles would change it to a red of the \u0003rst order.153\nShapiro continued,\nNewton\u2019s argument has a testable consequence. If it is assumed as he does\nthat chymical reactions involve only a change in the size of the corpuscles,\nand the colors of bodies are produced by those corpuscles just as in thin\n\u0003lms, then the sequence of color changes in a chymical reaction should\nfollow the order of the colors in Newton\u2019s Rings.154\nAs Newton explained in a published letter to Boyle:\nFor the colors of all natural bodies whatever seem to depend on nothing\nbut the various sizes and densities of their particles. . . . If the particles be\nvery small (a are those of salts, vitriols, and gums) they are transparent;\nand as they are supposed bigger and bigger, they put on these colors in\norder, black, white, yellow, red; violet, blue, pale green, yellow, orange, red;\npurple, blue green, yellow, orange, red, &amp;c. as is discerned by the colors,\nwhich appear at the several thicknesses of very thin plates of transparent\nbodies. Whence, to know the causes of the changes of colors, which\n150\nShapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms, p. 119.\nAs Newton remarked, \u201cSo the Colors of the third Series all succeed in order;\n\u0003rst, the violet . . . then the blue and green which are less mix\u2019d with other Colors, and\nconsequently more lively than before.\u201d Opticks, Book II, Part II, pp. 229\u201330.\n152\nShapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms, p. 119.\n153\nBirch, History of the Royal Society, 3: 301, as quoted in Shapiro, Fits, Passions, and\nParoxysms, p. 120.\n154\nShapiro, Fits, Passions, and Paroxysms, pp. 120\u2013121.\n151\n\nPages 161:\n144\nchapter four\nare often made by the mixtures of several liquors, it is to be considered,\nhow the particles of any tincture may have their size or density altered\nby the infusion of another liquor.155\nHence, using Newton\u2019s logic, Robinson believed it was possible to argue\nfrom the color change observed by the exposure of blood to the air\nthat acid was involved. An atmospheric acid attenuated the color of the\nblood, changing it to the smaller corpuscles of red versus the larger violet\ncorpuscles of venous blood, just as acid liquors turned the indicator\nsyrup of violets a red color. And, because color changes in a chymical\nreaction must follow the order of colors in Newton\u2019s rings, Robinson\ncould demonstrate the degree of the attenuation of the color as well\nas size of blood corpuscles by observing the order of color that the\nblood displayed in a chymical reaction.\nIn response to critics of his chymical theories of physiology, Robinson\nfurther utilized Newton\u2019s ideas in the De Natura acidorum to prove the\nexistence of acids in the air.156 In his discussion of short-range attraction\nbetween corpuscles of matter, Newton postulated acids were \u201cendued\nwith a great Attractive Force . . . in which their Activity consists,\u201d and\nthat they \u201cwere of a middle Nature between [a more volatile Water]\nand Terrestrial Bodies\u201d attracting both. Salts were also supposed to\nbe composed of acids and earth elements \u201cunited by attraction.\u201d\nRobinson believed that the formation of nitre in the mortar of walls\nwas the result of the union of atmospheric acids and earthy elements.\nRobinson wrote:\n155\nNewton, \u201cNewton\u2019s Letter to Boyle,\u201d February 28, 1678\u20139, in Isaac Newton\u2019s Papers\nand Letters On Natural Philosophy, p. 251.\n156\nThese critics included Dr. Thomas Morgan, who in the Mechanical Practice of Physick objected to Robinson\u2019s hydraulic applications of Newtonian physics, and who was\nskeptical of Robinson\u2019s identi\u0003cation of acid as the life-giving principle of respiration,\nnoting that acid extinguished \u0003re and therefore could hardly preserve the heat of the\nheart. See Thomas Morgan, The Mechanical Practice of Physick (London: T. Woodward,\n1735). Since Morgan was a deist, writing tracts such as The Moral Philosopher (1737\u20131741)\nthat questioned the veracity of scripture, he was not disturbed by Robinson\u2019s heavy\nemphasis on iatromechamism and seeming deism. However, several authors in the 1730s\nfelt that the theories of \u201cNewton-struck\u201d physicians and Newtonian views on aether\ncould lead to deism or atheism, such as John Hutchinson (1674\u20131737). See John C.\nEnglish, \u201cJohn Hutchinson\u2019s Critique of Newtonian Heterodoxy,\u201d Church History 68, 3\n(September 1999), pp. 581\u201398; For other philosophers critical of Robinson and Newton see Geoffrey Cantor, \u201cAnti-Newton,\u201d in John Fauvel et al., Let Newton Be! (Oxford:\nOxford University Press, 1988), pp. 203\u2013221; Scho\u0003eld, Mechanism and Materialism, pp.\n122\u201328; Thackray, Atoms and Powers, pp. 244\u201352.\n\nPages 162:\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n145\nWhence it follows, that the Formation of Nitre on the Sides of plaistered\nWalls and on the Mortar of Brick Walls defended from Rain and Sun,\nmust be owing to acid Parts of the Air uniting with the earthy alcalious\nparts of the Lime, by the strong Attractions which intercedes them: And\ntherefore the Air abounds with Acid Particles.157\nMost likely Robinson was observing the formation of potassium carbonate or saltpetre crystals on walls that had been whitened by limestone,\nsimilar to the formation of nitre crystals in limestone saltpeter caves;\nbecause nitre will not form in areas of excess humidity, we have seen\nthat many early modern chemists believed something in the air was\nthe source of a generative power to create nitre.158\nRobinson also utilized chymical examples from query 31 of Newton\u2019s\nOpticks to demonstrate that \u201cit is the Nature of Acids to dissolve Bodies\nwith Heat,\u201d and that atmospheric acids were ultimately responsible for\nmaintaining the motion of the heart. In his speculations about the source\nof attractive powers of magnetism, electricity, and gravity, Newton\nspeculated upon close-range forces between individual corpuscles of\nmatter, and utilized several chymical examples involving vitriol. Just as\nthe formation of nitre was believed by early modern English chemists\nsuch as Lister (see chapter three) to be evidence of a formative power\nin the air, so was the formation of vitriol from the exposure of iron or\ncopper pyrites to the atmosphere. Vitriol was thought to be consisted\nof an \u201cinsipid\u201d earth called ocher, some iron metal, mineral sulphur,\nan acid salt, and some small portion of a volatile aerial salt, and was\nsometimes identi\u0003ed as a \u201cuniversal salt\u201d responsible for generating\nother minerals.159 Spirit of vitriol was vitriolic acid (likely sulphuric\nacid). Robinson quoted from the Opticks:\n157\nBryan Robinson, A Letter to Dr. Cheyne, containing an account of the motion of Water\nthrough Ori\u0002ces and Pipes; and an Answer to Dr. Morgan\u2019s Remarks on Dr. Robinson\u2019s Treatise\nof the Animal Oeconomy (Dublin: S.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 141 to 163 of the document. The text primarily discusses the role of acids and salts in natural philosophy and alchemy, with a focus on the contributions of <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> (1642–1727) and his contemporaries, such as <strong>Bryan Robinson</strong> (1680–1754) and <strong>John Mayow</strong> (1640–1679).

- <strong>Newton&#x27;s Work on Acids and Salts</strong>: Newton explored the connection between acids and the processes of fermentation and heat generation. He proposed that acids were crucial to both natural processes and chymical reactions. In his work *Opticks* (1730), Newton examined how acids acted on different substances, contributing to changes in physical properties, such as color and temperature [Newton, *Opticks*, 1730, p. 380](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=141).

- <strong>Acids and Fermentation</strong>: Newton believed that acids and sulphurous particles were responsible for various natural phenomena, including lightning and thunder. He described these interactions in *Opticks* and suggested that atmospheric acids contributed to the process of fermentation, which was central to life and matter transformation [Newton, *Opticks*, p. 142](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=142).

- <strong>Bryan Robinson’s Experiments</strong>: Robinson&#x27;s *Treatise of the Animal Oeconomy* (1734) built on Newton’s ideas, applying them to the physiology of respiration. Robinson argued that acid particles in the air mixed with the blood in the lungs, preserving the life of animals through a process analogous to the burning of sulphurous substances [Robinson, *Treatise of the Animal Oeconomy*, 1734, p. 195](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=163).

To maintain temperature equilibrium in the body,\nRobinson concluded that \u201cAir when it is cold abounds more with . . . Acid,\nthan when it is hot. And that it is does so, appears from Fire burning\nbest when the Air is coldest, and worst when it is hottest.\u201d164\nThis meant that in the winter with more acid in the air, that blood\nwas more dissolved or attenuated than in summer; the same was true\nfor cold countries versus hotter climes. Robinson then concluded that\nsince in hotter countries there was more malignant disease, an ancient\nproposition based on Galenic medicine and to be later bolstered by\nEnlightenment principles of geographic determinism, malignant disease was due to a \u201cwant of a suf\u0003cient Dissolution or Attenuation of\nthe Blood.\u201d165 To explain why the body experienced hypothermia in\nexcessive cold, Robinson proposed that when the air was very cold and\nsaturated with acid, \u201cthe mutual attraction of its [acidic] particles, arising from their closeness to one another, may hinder them from being\ndrawn into the Blood in as great a Quantity.\u201d166 This ensuing lack\nof acid in the blood would destroy its heat and \u0002uidity, which would\neventually stop the heart. As support for his assertions, Robinson again\nused examples of chymical reactions involving oil of vitriol, noting that\nstrong oil of vitriol would not dissolve metals as quickly as when it was\nweaker due to its higher concentrations of acid.\nIf want of acid in the blood caused disease, Robinson wished to know\nthe effects of the effects of acidic particles on the \u0003bers of the body in\norder to formulate practical medicaments to treat disease. Boerhaave\nbelieved that muscles, bones, blood, circulatory vessels, and nerves\nwere made of \u0003bers that could become either too elastic or too rigid\nand therefore cause disease. Lack of motion of bodily \u0002uids could also\ncause ailments.167 Under the in\u0002uence of the theories of Boerhaave,\n164\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 213.\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 213.\n166\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 215.\n167\nRobinson in fact devoted his Letter to Dr. Cheyne to a study of the hydraulics of\nbodily \u0002uids and disease.

Then\non the Groove of the Brass pRq I hung a Scale with a Weight W, and\nobserved the encreased Length or Extension of the Hair when dry in two\nMinutes of Time, caused by the uniform Action of the given Weight of\n300 Grains, which was the sum of the Weights of the Scale, or W, and\nof the little Brass pRq.170\nThen he took the hair off the scale, \u201crub\u2019d with the given Fluid,\u201d and\nplaced it back on to measure its Extension, formulating elaborate tables\nof his results of the hair\u2019s extension and its corresponding strength and\nhealth [Figures 11 and 12].\nRobinson \u0003rst concluded that table two demonstrated\n1.

This meant\nthat this salt drew something out of air besides water giving it its\nstrengthening quality.171\n2. Experiments by Newton in the Opticks demonstrated that salt of tartar\nper deliquium attracted Acids more strongly than any Metal.172\n3. By Robinson\u2019s proposition 24, the air abounded with acid particles,\nso the \u201cwatry Moisture imbibed from the air by this Salt when it\ndeliquates, must be strongly impregnated with acid particles.\u201d173\n4. Therefore, \u201cif the Acid of the Air be the sole Cause of the great\nExcess of the Strengthening Power of Salt of Tartar per deliquium\nabove that of the strongest Solution of the same Salt in Water,\u201d such\nas receive most of the Acid into their Blood will have the strongest\n\u0003bers.174 Animal \u0003bers would be strongest in \u201cfrosty weather,\u201d since\nthe air abounded more with acid particles then.\n5. Robinson concluded that animal \u0003bers and \u0002uids had their strengthening powers from the acid of the Air, \u201cunited with their component\nparticles by virtue of its strong attraction.\u201d175\nRobinson then turned to the effects of oils and alkalis on animal\n\u0003bers, noting from his experiments that the data in table one revealed\nthat \u201cOils, ardent Spirits, and all Liquors abounding with oily Parts\nstrengthen Animal Fibres, and warm Water and alcalious Spirits weaken\nthem.\u201d176 He observed that alkalious intestinal gall mixed with animal\noils lessened the strength of hairs, concluding that gall in the intestines\n\u201clessens the strengthening power of the oil part of the aliment in its\npassage thro them.\u201d177 Yet, the fats of animals were more strengthening to animal \u0003bers than olive oil, which showed that the oily part\nof the animal fats regains \u201cin the blood that part of its strengthening\npower which it loses in the Intestines by being mixed with the Gall.\u201d178\nRobinson postulated that animal fat regained that strengthening power\nby being exposed to the acid of the air, as the blood of animals has\n171\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 301; Ecklund, Incomplete Chymist, s.v. \u201cdeliquescence.\u201d\n172\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 302\u2013303.\n173\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 303\u2013304.\n174\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 304.\n175\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 304.\n176\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 343.\n177\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 305.\n178\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 305\u2013306.\n\nPages 168:\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n151\na constant supply of this acid by means of respiration. Therefore\nthe atmospheric acids also seemed to be the immediate cause of the\nstrengthening power of oils and all \u0002uids abounding with oily parts.\nOn the other hand if an alkali like sal ammoniac (likely ammonium\nchloride or NH4Cl though the term was sometimes used for other\nammonium salts) was applied to hair continuously, the \u0003ber grew less\nand less elastic or \u201cweaker\u201d over time.179 Robinson then noted that\nanimal \u0003bers like hair contained an \u201cacid in their composition, forasmuch as they contained salt\u201d; according to Newton\u2019s Opticks, salt was\ncomposed of acid and earth united by attraction.180 Therefore, alkalis\nlike sal ammoniac lessened the strength of animal \u0003bers by drawing off\ntheir acids from their earthy parts, \u201cupon which acid the strength of\n\u0003bres depends.\u201d181 To further support his assertion, Robinson referred\nto the work of Stephen Hales, particularly his Vegetable Staticks (1727).\nHales was a \u201cdisciple of Boyle, Mayow and Newton,\u201d and his Staticks\nwas \u201cself consciously\u201d written in the \u201cstyle of Newton\u2019s Opticks.\u201d182\n\u201cIn\u0002uenced by some of Newton\u2019s ideas on the chymical role of air,\u201d\nHales demonstrated that air could unite with other substances such as\nsal ammoniac.183 Hales postulated that upon such union air lost elasticity,\nand thought this decrease was due to the air\u2019s \u201c\u0003xation by acid . . . fumes\nraised with that air.\u201d184 In other words, just as air lost elasticity by having sal ammoniac drawing off its acid, sal ammoniac applied to animal\n\u0003bers also weakened them by the same mechanism.\nIn Section V of the Animal Oeconomy, Robinson then did a series of\nexperiments in which he demonstrated that the same chymical substances that strengthened and weakened animal \u0003bers had the same\neffects upon the blood by increasing or decreasing its viscosity. For\ninstance, spirit of hartshorn (a strong solution of ammonia produced\nby the distillation of hartshorn [NH4O4]) as an alkali weakened the\nblood \u201cwhen taken in too large a quantity,\u201d causing blood thinness and\nhemorrhaging, whereas blood coagulated by animal venom became \u0002uid\n179\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 307\u2013308.\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 309.\n181\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 309.\n182\nMilton Kerker, \u201cHerman Boerhaave and the Development of Pneumatic\nChemistry,\u201d Isis 46 (1955), pp. 36\u201349, on 39; Brown, \u201cMedicine in the Shadow of\nthe Principia,\u201d p. 645.\n183\nKerker, \u201cHerman Boerhaave,\u201d p. 39.\n184\nKerker, \u201cHerman Boerhaave,\u201d p. 39.\n180\n\nPages 169:\n152\nchapter four\nby \u201clarge doses of alcalious spirits.\u201d185 To explain blood chymistry and\nits interaction with the acids of the air, Robinson wrote:\nthe acid of the air, after it is taken into the blood, unites with its Salts,\nand thereby renders them grosser and less volatile . . . in like Manner\nas Spirit of Sea-salt which is an acid spirit [most likely hydrochloric\nacid] and Spirit of Soot which is a volatile alcalious spirit, being mixed\ntogether unite and compose the Particles of Sal Ammoniac, which are\ngrosser and less volatile than before: But volatile alcalious Spirits, which\nare composed of volatile alcalious Salts and Water, attenuate and thin the\nBlood. . . . And therefore the Acid of the Air, by channeling the Salts of\nthe Blood and become volatile by Heat or Putrefaction in to a Kind of\nSal-armoniac . . . keeps up a Tenacity in the Blood. Hence the blood will\nbe apt to abound with volatile Salt, when it is not suf\u0003ciently impregnated\nwith this Acid.186\nRobinson then explained that a lack of acid in the blood was most\nlikely to happen in hot weather, when the air contained less acid. This\nwas because there were more sulphureous steams and volatile salts in\nthe atmosphere that were raised from the earth in hot weather. Salts\nalso arose from putrid substances of vegetables and animals in warmer\nclimes, and the heat meant people were likely more inactive or had\nmore putrid fevers, and their blood and breath tended to abound with\nvolatile salts.\nRobinson\u2019s theory at its basis had its origin in the work of van\nHelmont, who we have seen originated the study of volatile salts in\na primarily iatrochymical and medical context. In his analysis of the\nchemistry of the blood, van Helmont claimed that venous blood, having given nourishment to the organs of the body, was made volatile\nand converted into gas that was breathed out.187 It thus seems that\nRobinson again dovetailed older Helmontian beliefs in a vital volatile\nsalt, \u0003t them into a Newtonian chymical construct which emphasized\n185\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, 344. It is possible here that Robinson was affected\nby his contemporary Dr. Richard Mead\u2019s work on poisons, which advised much the\nsame type of medicaments.

As we have seen, the basis for his treatments was an extension\nof the acids-alkali theory of the humors which had its origin in the\n1660s among iatrochymists on the Continent in\u0002uenced by van Helmont\nand Sylvius.188\nInstead of using acids or alkalis to \u201crestore the balance of the humors,\u201d\nRobinson utilized these popular medicaments to appropriately strengthen\nor weaken the animal \u0003bers and blood to attain bodily balance and treat\ndisease. To treat fevers in \u201cwhich the Salts of the Blood are rendered too\nvolatile by Heat or Putrefaction,\u201d such as child-bed fever, Robinson\nprescribed \u201csweating with acidulated Drinks,\u201d as sweating would carry\noff part of the volatile Salts and the acids would restore balance in a\nover-alcalious blood.189 Drinks impregnated with acids were also more\ncooling, and treatment would continue until there were signs of \u201cconcoction\u201d in the urine, signaling a growing tenacity of the blood and\nbodily \u0003bers.190 (Concoction referred to the ripening of morbi\u0003c matter\nto perfection, making it \u0003t for elimination from the body; by concoction,\nnoxious humors were separated from sound ones).191 In other ailments,\nsuch as in an \u201cphthisis\u201d (tuberculosis), where there was an putrid fever\nand the blood abounded with volatile salts, Robinson prescribed riding,\nparticularly in cold air by which the blood was \u201cplentifully\u201d supplied\nwith atmospheric acids.192 The pulmonary lesions in tuberculosis were\nlikely evidence to Robinson of hemorrhaging, which was a signal of the\n\u201cdissolution\u201d and acrimony of the blood due to its high concentration\nof alkali salts.

The advent of\nacid-alkali iatrochymistry and the in\u0002uence of Newtonianism lessened\nthe in\u0002uence of Helmontian chymistry with its emphasis on vital salts.\nThis chapter, in contrast, will analyze the continuing in\u0002uence that salt\nchymistry had in wider society. We will concentrate on two areas, both\nhaving to do with the perceived \u201clegitimacy\u201d of salt iatrochymistry\nin medical treatment. First we will analyze the use of salts in patent\nmedicines and popular medicaments, and secondly, we will examine\nthe role that salt chymistry played in popular literature, primarily that\nwhich satirized alchemy and chymical medicine. Though much has\nbeen written by Rattansi, Webster, and Cook about chymical medicine\namong elites, including the attempt at the formation of a Society of\nChymical Physicians in 1665, iatrochymistry at the popular medical\nlevel is something which necessitates more analysis.1 Likewise, there\nhas been work about satire leveled at alchemists in general, but little\nabout literature that took its inspiration from Helmontian salt chymistry,\ndespite its pervasive in\u0002uence among natural philosophers and physicians.

The general lack of effectiveness of most remedies, as well as the high cost of licensed medical care\nmeant that patients were likely to seek several alternatives. From the\nhousewife making herbal remedies to treat her children, to the valetudinarian Robert Boyle\u2019s preoccupation with various nostrums, medical\nknowledge was of great concern to the larger population.3\nBy the mid seventeenth century, proprietary medicines or mass-marketed \u201cquack remedies\u201d emerged in the English medical marketplace. As\none of the editors of the early eighteenth-century London newspaper\nThe British Apollo opined, any \u201cNostrum of some Never-born Doctor . . . if\nexpos\u2019d to Sale at Tower-Hill, Lincolns-Inn or Moore-Fields, twill yield\na Summ of Money as soon as any other valuable commodity.\u201d4 Previously, as Cook has mentioned, more \u201corthodox\u201d physicians, beginning\nin the seventeenth century, avoided charges of quackery and \u0002ogging\ntheir wares by refraining from using broadsheets; rather they would write\nshort pamphlets about their medicaments which were more respectable.5\nAdvertisements in the late-seventeenth and early eighteenth-century\n2\nTara E.

Though it is true, as I have shown in other publications, that elites\nlargely disavowed most astrological medicine by the end of the seventeenth century, at the popular level, there was still a pervasive belief that\nthe planets affected and caused bodily illness.9 Physicians looking for a\nmeans to sell medicaments were apparently well aware of this, and as\nthis chapter will show, used the language of saline iatrochymistry as a\nmarketing tool to promote \u201cinnovative\u201d medicines within a framework\nof medical theory which was entirely traditional.

Although he spent part of his\nprofessional career as a poet, attempting to promote a new metrical\nversion of the Psalms (published in 1701), he became better known\nfor his work as a physician.10 In 1712, he wrote a treatise on scrofula,\nor the king\u2019s evil, which is the \u201ctubercular in\u0002ammation of the lymph\nglands of the neck,\u201d although the term was \u201cemployed more loosely\nto comprehend a wide variety of complaints affecting the heat, neck\nand eyes, particularly swollen lips, tumors, sores and blisters\u201d as well as\ncataracts.11 Gibbs was motivated to publish for legal and commercial\nreasons. He had apparently cured a youth from Plymouth of scrofula\nin 1706 that had been unsuccessfully treated with mercury. However,\nGibbs had not been paid for his pains and thus \u201ccommenced an\n[legal] action against [the boy\u2019s] Father, for the sum he promised\u201d at\nLaunceston and subsequently received his fee.12 Because the father\ncontinued to maintain that Gibbs had not truly healed his son, which\nresulted in some other unspeci\u0003ed \u201cvarious discourses concernying this\nTryal,\u201d Gibbs \u201cthought \u0003t to publish\u201d his treatise in vindication of the\ncourt\u2019s judgment and his course of treatment, and his reputation as\na physician.13 Gibbs\u2019 medicament, based on acid-alkali iatrochymistry\nand mechanism combined with older beliefs about astrological medicine was also suf\u0003ciently different from the usual cures for scrofula via\n10\nDNB, 1937\u201339 ed., s.v. \u201cGibbs, James.\u201d; James Gibbs, The First Fifteen Psalms of\nDavid, translated into Lyric Verse, propos\u2019d as an essay, supplying the Perspicuity and Coherence\naccording to the Modern Art of Poetry (London: J.

Anne Geneva has\nillustrated that the analogy of the monarch with the sun was pervasive\nin early modern England.16 Further, astrological physicians often prescribed solar astrological amulets made of gold, which via antipathy\nwould protect against lunar diseases, like scrofula. Therefore, it is possible the amulet given by the monarch to the sufferer was associated at\nsome level as an antipathetic astrological preventative. Indeed, if it was\nnot possible to visit the king or afford a gold talisman, one astrological\nphysician of the late seventeenth century recommended \u201cthree solary\nherbs to wear . . . haveing a vertue agreeing with the nature of Gold,\nand serveth instead of Gold, as Gold is under the dominion of the\nSun as being a Metal.\u201d17\n14\nRichard Saunders, The astrological judgment and practice of physick (London: Langely\nCurtis, 1677), p. 198.\n15\nThomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, p. 196. In the iconographic collection of\nthe Wellcome Institute in London, there are pictures of these amulets issued by Charles\nII. Although before the Restoration, the scrofula talisman was a real gold coin, called\nan \u2018angel\u2019 with the impression of St. George slaying the dragon, the medal issued by\nCharles illustrates a hand coming out of the illuminated heavens touching the heads of\na group of sufferers. The slogan reads: \u201cHe toucheth them, and they weare healed,\u201d\na clear and politically astute allusion to the divinity of the monarch and perhaps to\nthe healing powers of the heavens themselves.

Aristotle\u2019s linkage of life with the generative\nsun and motion inherent in the soul-principle\u2014the pneuma\u2014also meant\nthat he considered the motion of the heart as indicative that it was the\nseat of the soul.21 The sun was thus often associated by early modern\nEnglish writers with the animal spirits and the circulatory system.22 In\nthe Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton said of the middle region of\nthe body that \u201cthe principal part is the heart, which is the seat and\nfountain of life, or heat, of spirits, of pulse and respiration, the sun of\nour body, the king and sole commander of it, the seat and organ of all\npassions and affections.\u201d23 William Harvey thought the blood was the\nbest example of the animal spirits, writing that \u201cfor us physicians, spirit\nis . . . namely that whatsoever attempts anything by its own endeavour\n18\nGibbs, Observations of various eminent cures, p. 3.\nGibbs, Observations of various eminent cures, p. 58.\n20\nGibbs, Observations of various eminent cures, p. 59.\n21\nSpeci\u0003cally, Aristotle said that the heart produced the pneuma \u201cwhich is continually\ncreated and renewed inside the body so long as there is heat and life. It is the vehicle\nof the soul, and as such is responsible for reproduction and movement.\u201d Galen, Galen\non Respiration and the Arteries, trans. David J. Furley and J.S.

Thus some bodies cause a coldness by repelling,\nbaiting back, or crowding together the said Spirits.27\nGibbs then put a mechanical gloss on this traditional explanation. Like\nMead, in his discussion of how his treatments affected the body, he\nwanted to avoid \u201cPhilosophical Cant.\u201d Gibbs, disavowing the \u201coccult\nNotions of Expression\u201d of the Peripatetics demonstrated \u201cMechanically\nthe Operation of such Medicines . . . explaining their Forms and Qualities by which they are dispos\u2019d and enabled to perform such effects.\u201d28\nSpeci\u0003cally, Gibbs utilized the acids-alkali theory of the humours and\nsaline iatrochymistry.\nGibbs\u2019 work may have been more directly in\u0002uenced by the wellknown treatise by English physician John Browne, entitled Adenochoiradelogia (1684) in which the acid-alkali theory is a basis for treatment, and\nin which Browne speculates about lunar in\u0002uences in scrofula.29 Browne\nfelt that the \u201cTydes . . . [were] . . . the presages of Sickness as well as of\nHealth, of Recovery or Death\u201d; therefore \u201cproper Conjectures\u201d were\nnecessary to explain how the cycles of the \u201cPlenilunaries\u201d regulated\n24\nWilliam Harvey, Disputations Touching the Generation of Animals, trans.

The lymph as a result coagulated much as \u201cmilk is coagulable\nby vinegar\u201d; the acid\u2019s coagulative effects were produced by particles\nwhich are long and sharp pointed, and can be no otherwise dispos\u2019d for\nCoagulation, which is a trans\u0003xing, and it were a Nailing together; and\nby that means accumulating the sulphurs of the lymph into a curd-like\nmass.33\nAnd, it was this turgescence and coagulation of the lymph in the lymphatic ducts caused the glandular swellings of scrofula, and the blockage\nof the optic nerve by these excess scrophulous humours caused the sore\neyes and blindness associated with the \u201cking\u2019s evil.\u201d\nGibbs\u2019 remedy was administration of volatile salts or alkalis that\nwould decoagulate the tumors and cure the disease by acting as a chemical substitution for the traditional vitalizing in\u0002uence of sunshine on the\nbody. In this course of treatment, Gibbs displays some in\u0002uence from\nEnglish Helmontians who, making the traditional associations between\nthe vital spirits and the heart, would administer volatile alkaline salts\ndistilled from blood to restore the weakened vital spirits or archaeus of\nthe body. Robert Boyle himself also attempted to distill the spirit of\n30\nBrowne, \u2018Preface\u2019, in Adenochoiradelogia, fol.

When the moon passed over a part of the\nsea, she obstructed and damped the elastic ferment of the atmosphere,\ncausing the waters to ebb. However, when the moon passed and the\nsun took over again, the renewed elasticity of the atmosphere upon\nthe waters caused them to \u0002ow.37\nTimothy By\u0002eld, the Sal Volatile Oleosum, and Lockyer\u2019s Pill\nTimothy By\u0003eld was less isolated geographically than Gibbs, but more\nmarginally placed in the profession. An Irishman and a former dissenting minister, By\u0003eld had his practice in London; although he claimed\nto be an MD and a fellow of the College of Physicians in Dublin, he\napparently did not graduate from an English university.38 He primarily\n34\nClericuzio, \u201cFrom Van Helmont to Boyle,\u201d p. 333.\nSee Clericuzio, \u201cFrom Van Helmont to Boyle,\u201d pp. 326\u2013334 for further information on how English chemical physicians combined Helmontian chymistry with\ncorpuscular theories.\n36\nClericuzio, \u201cFrom van Helmont to Boyle,\u201d p. 334.\n37\nGibbs, Observations of various eminent cures, pp. 63\u20134.\n38\nWilliam Berkin, \u201cThe Dissenting Tradition in English Medicine of the Seventeenth\nand Eighteenth Centuries,\u201d Medical History 39 (1995), 197\u2013218, on p. 217.

These lightbeams \u201cincircled\nwith radical Moisture\u201d from cloud vapours were \u201cSpiritual Nourishment.\u201d Along with this spiritual essence, we also needed food so\nthat the natural Spirits may be recruited, which do continually slide\nforth thro\u2019 the Pores; for thus we must maintain a successive repair of\nthe loss of Nature. Our nourishing Juices are made by the more succulent substance of our Meat, whereby the Parts and Humours of the\nBody are reinforc\u2019d. The radical Moisture is renewed out of the purer\nParticles of Blood, with the celestial In\u0002uences intermingling with \u2018em\nby Respiration. Thus the natural ferment of Man\u2019s Body, as well from\nhis spiritual as his corporeal Diet, seems to consist in a Sulphuro-Saline\nTemperament, which Vital Union becomes more imbodied in oleose\nSalts, and then assumes a greater Corporeity.41\nBy\u0003eld believed that nitrous salts in the air were bound up with sulphurs, as sulphur\u2019s oily qualities were similar to oily sperm and thus\nnear \u201cthe Principles of life\u2019; since sulphureous oils often appeared red,\nso he thought they gave blood its red tincture.42 Volatile salts were\nalso plentiful in bodily \u0002uids like sweat and urine, so it was evident\nthey were important components of the humors as well. By\u0003eld thus\nclaimed that via chymical art he drew down \u201cfrom the Sun and Air\nplenty of illuminated Sulphurs,\u201d combining them with volatile salts to\nmake his medicament.\n\u201cMedicine within the Market: proprietary medicines in seventeenth-century England,\u201d\nLondon School of Economics History Seminars, http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/\neconomicHistory/seminars/Haycockpaper.pdf, p. 5.

As we have seen, the association of\nthe sun with vitalizing qualities was also quite traditional in astrological medicine. But like Gibbs, By\u0003eld then appended acid-alkali iatrochymistry to his medicine, claiming in typical fashion that excess acid\n\u201cpreyed upon\u201d the sulphureity in the blood, fermenting it, transmuting\nits juices into a \u201cvitriolick tartness,\u201d and taking away its vital force.43\nHis medicine restored the sulphureous content in the blood, as well as\nneutralizing excess acids; the sulphureo-saline volatiles also loosened\nfood in the stomach \u201cprecipitated and hardened by Acids.\u201d Although\nBy\u0003eld\u2019s medicine was a very panacea, remedying \u201call aguish Distempers, Rheumatisms, Dropsies, Jaundices, etc.,\u201d he was aware that if\nhe \u201cenumerated Diseases at this rate . . . \u2019Tis so rank Quackish.\u201d44 He\nwas selling a patent medicine, but he still wished to retain some sense\nof respectability.\nNot so for his colleague Lionel Lockyer. Lockyer (1600\u20131672) widely\npublicized a secret preparation \u201ccalled Pilulae Radiis Solis Extractae\u201d\npurported to be a medicine of a \u201csolar nature, dispelling of those causes\nin our Bodies, which continued, would not only darken the Lustre, but\nextinguish the Light of Our Microcosmical Sun.\u201d45 The microcosmical\nsun was considered to be the heart, as it animated the body with the\nanimal spirits, much as the sun animated the earth with its rays. Much\nlike Gibbs or By\u0003eld\u2019s claims for volatile salts, Lockyer\u2019s pill quickened\nthe vital spirits. The composition of the pill was mostly glass of antimony, or vitrum antimonii, a transparent glass created from a preparation\nof antimony; glass of antimony was a common medicament and an\nextremely strong emetic, usually administered in wine, and popularly\nthought to work, according to the London newspaper the British Apollo\ndue to the \u201csaline and sulphureous particles of the antimony, who subtile ef\u0002uvia thus impregnated the wine with the aforesaid virtue.\u201d46 The\n43\nBy\u0003eld, Horae Subsecivae, p. 10.\nBy\u0003eld, Horae Subsecivae, p. 29.\n45\nLionel Lockyer, An Advertisement Concerning those Most Excellent Pills Called Pilulae\nRadiis Solis Extractae.

In his literary\nanalysis, Linden argues that in England, Geoffrey Chaucer began a long\ntradition of alchemical satire that was interrupted by a new tradition of\nspiritual alchemy in the poetry of Donne and Herbert, and others, before\na return in the work of Samuel Butler to the earlier satirical tradition at\nthe turn of the eighteenth century.53 One of the most prevalent writers\nof this revived genre was Johann Heinrich Cohausen (1665\u20131750) a\nphysician and well-known author in the Germanies and France, and\nin England, where his works were widely translated and disseminated\n[Figure 14]. The Hermippus, as well as Cohausen\u2019s other books, were listed\nin a number of eighteenth-century English book and auction catalogues,\nindicating a reasonably wide distribution; his works were also present\nin the Royal College of Physician\u2019s Library, as well as in the library\n54\nof Martin Folkes, who served as the President of the Royal Society.\n52\nLionel Lockyer, An Advertisement Concerning those Most Excellent Pills Called Pilulae\nRadiis Solis Extractae.

When the satyrs returned them, the desperate\nvictims grabbed the wrong noses and were unrecognizable55 [Figure 15].\nCohausen\u2019s last and most famous medical satire however was his Hermippus Redivivus (1742), a treatise on salt chymistry and the prolongation of life. Studies of Cohausen and the Hermippus have been largely\nantiquarian; the only scholarly works a French dissertation concerning\nhis medical biography done in 1900 and a short German bibliographic\nstudy.56 Because Cohausen has been primarily known for medical satire,\nhis large numbers of serious treatises on iatrochymistry and medicine\nwhich served as the basis for his more humorous works have been\nlargely unexamined.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have completed the summary from pages 164 to 187 of the document. The content in this section primarily discusses <strong>Bryan Robinson’s</strong> continued exploration of acids and salts in physiological and medical contexts. The main points include:

1. <strong>The Influence of Acids on Bodily Functions</strong>:
   - Robinson argued that cold weather, with higher acid concentrations in the air, had a dissolving effect on blood. This observation was rooted in his study of fire reactions and physiological processes [Robinson, *Animal Oeconomy*, 1734, p. 213](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=164).
   
2. <strong>Effects on Animal Fibers</strong>:
   - Robinson experimented with human hair, testing its elasticity after treatment with different chymical substances. He measured how the hair’s extension reflected the effects of these treatments on bodily fibers [p. 293](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=166).

3. <strong>Application to Blood Chemistry</strong>:
   - He concluded that the same chymical reactions affecting hair would influence the viscosity and health of the blood. Alkaline substances weakened the blood, while acids strengthened it [p. 344](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=169).

These theories of van Helmont and\nSanctorius would have been recognizable to English natural philosophers and doctors who read Cohausen\u2019s work, and Cohausen\u2019s skillful\nuse of their medical and chymical ideas may have contributed to the\npopularity of his satire in that country.\nAlthough Cohausen\u2019s scholarly treatises demonstrated he was committed to chymical medicine in his own practice, he could still with\ntrenchant wit poke fun at the pursuit of immortality. Cohausen admitted at the end of the Hermippus that he wrote it in a humorous vein\nfor his own enjoyment (and likely in hopes of book sales), but he also\nknew that the basis of his work was recently-accepted medical beliefs\nand applications which made his satire all the more effective. Cohausen\nsimply modi\u0003ed the traditional literary conceit of satirizing the search\nfor the philosophers\u2019 stone with a humorous treatment of more current\niatrochymical analyses of respiration and longevity, taking these ideas\nto outrageous conclusions. Ironically, because of Cohausen\u2019s skillfulness\nin presenting medical concepts in the Hermippus, further analyzing the\nintellectual context of his ironic treatise is also an aid to our understanding of early modern theories of longevity and iatrochymistry.\nThe Basis for the Hermippus\nThe title of the Hermippus Redivivus was likely based upon two references. Hermippus was an ancient one-eyed comic active during the\nPeloponnesian War who parodied Homer and wrote satiric verse, a\ngenre of which Cohausen was fond.58 In the Hermippus, the reader was\ntreated to a \u201credivivus\u201d or redux of such humor, so Cohausen in his\ntitle was thus indicating to his audience his satiric intent. Cohausen also\nclaimed that the title was based upon an ancient and most certainly\nnot genuine inscription said to have been found in the seventeenth\ncentury in Rome. Being an amateur classicist himself, the physician\ncorrectly claimed the inscription was included in Thomas Reinesius\u2019s\nmagisterial Syntagma Inscriptionum (1682) [Figure 16].

Clodius Hermippus who lived 115 years\nand 5 days via imbibing the breath of young women which had liferestoring qualities. In his work, Cohausen speculated about Hermippus\u2019\nlife, surmising that he was the prefect and teacher in an orphanage or\nschool for girls sponsored by the Roman government.61 He described\nin detail how Hermippus spent most of the day in the rooms of the\norphanage with the children telling them stories designed to promote\nvirtue and playing and joking with them. A large \u0003re was built in the\nmorning to rarify the air before the children arrived, so he would get\nthe most bene\u0003t out of the little girl\u2019s breath, and in damp weather, the\nrooms were perfumed so malicious smells would not enter; there also\nwas a garden surrounding the orphanage with plants which quickened\n59\nJohannes Henrico Cohausen, \u2018Preface\u2019, to Hermippus Redivivus, Sive Exercitatio PhysicoMedica Curiosa de Methodo Rara ad CXV Annos Progoandae Senectutis per Anhelitum Puellarum,\nex Veteri Monumento Deprompta, Nunc Artis Medicae Fundamentis Stabilita, Et Rationibus Atque\nExemplis, Hic Non Singulari Chymiae Philosophicae Paradoxo (Frankfurt-on-the-Oder: John\nBenjamin Andrae and Henry Hort, 1742), pp. 1\u20132.

Campbell assured a friend it was a\nmere jeu-d\u2019-esprit.\u201d67 William Godwin (1756\u20131836) later mentioned that\nthe Hermippus was the inspiration for his novel about a count to who\nwas revealed the secret of the philosophers\u2019 stone, the St. Leon: a tale of\nthe sixteenth century (1800).68 According to Osler, the book \u201chad a rapid\nsale and induced many people to adopt the notion of prolonging life\nby inhaling the breath of young persons. A physician took lodgings in\na boarding-school after having read the essay.\u201d69\nHowever, in its attempts to be entertaining, Campbell\u2019s translation\nadded even more ludicrous claims and content to Cohausen\u2019s original\nwork, augmenting it with legends of longevity from the medieval period,\ndeleting passages that may have offended the sensibilities of female\nreaders, and embellishing it even more in a 1749 edition where it sold\nwidely in England.70 These additions were not surprising, for Campbell\nwas well known to be skillful at \u0003ctitious autobiography and satire, writing for instance \u2018The Travels and Adventures of Edward Brown, Esq., formerly\na merchant in London\u2019, in 1739; the \u201cdescription given in it by three Arab\nbrothers . . . of a strayed camel, which they had never seen, may have\nsuggested to Voltaire the similarly constructive description of the dog\nand horse of the queen and king of Babylon in \u2018Zadig.\u2019 \u201d71 Dr. Johnson\nalso remarked that \u201cCampbell is not always rigidly careful of truth . . . he\nonce told me that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a sitting . . .

Born in Hildesheim in Lower\nSaxony, Cohausen studied medicine in Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and\nbecame physician to the Bishop of Munster in 1717, retiring to private\npractice in Vreden.74 In 1693, when Cohausen established his medical practice near Munster after his studies in Frankfurt-on-the-Oder,\nConrad Berthod Behrens, a physician in Hildesheim and member of\nthe Ac\u00e1d\u00e8mie Cesareo-Leopoldine, composed a treatise on longevity.75\nIt was dedicated to the prime minister of the bishop of Munster in\nhopes of patronage. However, after much anticipation and excitement\nin the Bishop of Munster\u2019s court about the secrets that the book would\nreveal, there was a bit of disappointment. Behrens argued that God\ndetermined there was a \u0003xed lifespan for humans and that prolonging life was not possible, leading to his subsequent exile from court.76\nHoping to make a name for himself, Cohausen penned his own work\non longevity, the Decas Tentaninum curiosa, and presented it to Frederick\nChristian, Bishop of Munster.77 This opportunistic work made his career,\nas the bishop subsequently showed him great favor, making him his\nprimary physician and a provincial physician for the jurisdictions of\nAhaus and Horstmar.78 Ensuring he would not have the fate of Behrens,\n73\nAccording to his D.N.B. entry, Campbell was charging nearly 2 guineas a sheet to\nwrite the last of his published works, so his business strategy was successful indeed.\n74\nAllgemeine Deutsche Biographie, http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de. s.v. \u201cCohausen, Johann\nHeinrich\u201d; Accessed 3 October 2005, Dictionnaire d\u2019histoire de la medicine (Mons, 1778),\ns.v. \u201cCohausen, Jean-Henri.\u201d The relatively few biographical resources on this physician\nwere also noted by Beauvois, p. 1.\n75\nBeauvois, p. 23.\n76\nBeauvois, p. 24.\n77\nBeauvois, pp. 24, 26. The work to which Beauvois referred was J.H. Cohausen, Tentamium physico-medicorum decas de vita humana (Cosfeld: Johann-Bartholomeus Steinii, 1699).\nThis treatise was published at Cohausen\u2019s own expense indicating his desire for patronage.\n78\nJodocus Herman Nunning, Commercii litterarii dissertationes epistolic\u00e6 historico-physicocurios\u00e6 . . .

The Decas though not initially written for\npurposes of satire but of patronage, would provide a useful resource\nwhen Cohausen wrote the Hermippus forty-four years later.\nAlthough he would not publish another work on longevity until the\nHermippus, (he did have an extended version of the Decas in manuscript\nform), Cohausen continued to evince a strong interest in publishing\nsurvey works based on the medicine, iatrochymistry and alchemy of\nvan Helmont. We have seen in previous chapters that among English\nnatural philosophers in the latter part of the seventeenth century, van\nHelmontian chymistry provided an in\u0002uential theoretical basis. Cohausen apparently followed suit. In his work on fevers Archeus febrium faber et\nmedicus, (Amsterdam 1731), Cohausen remarked of van Helmont: \u201cVir\nepicritica S.E. Cohausen, 3 vols.

This vision comprised the frontispiece which illustrated van Helmont receiving the gemma rosae or the \u201cperfect ruby,\u201d\nthe philosophers\u2019 stone, as well as the alchemical mystery of the ignisaquae, the alkahest or the universal solvent from a messenger of God\n[Figure 18].87\nWe have seen in chapter two that salts, particularly volatile ones that\nwere reactive when heated or possessed a distinct odor, were usually\n82\nBeauvois, pp. 58\u201359.\nJohannes Henrico Cohausen, Archeus Febrium Faber Et Medicus (Amsterdam: Salomon Schouten, 1681), p. 2.

However, van Helmont, realizing that the search for the alkahest\nwas dif\u0003cult, offered his followers an alternative, the volatilization of\n\u0003xed alkalies\u2014particularly salt of tartar [in modern terms, likely potassium carbonate or K2CO3], to produce a solvent with powers akin to,\nthough still inferior to those of the alkahest.89 Powerful alkalis indeed\ncan dissolve a good deal of substances via their corrosive nature, and\nare involved in saponi\u0003cation or soap-making. Cohausen again followed van Helmont\u2019s lead, and in an unpublished manuscript, the Sal\ntartari volatile intricassimum extricatum . . . de paraeparation alis tarati volatilsati,\nvice-alcahestini [The intricate extraction of the volatile salt of tartar, the\nvice-alkahest], he described his attempts to volatilize the rather nonevaporative potassium carbonate.90\nCohausen was interested in the volatilization of salts not only to\nproduce an alkahest, but because as we have seen, volatile salts in the\nblood were thought by van Helmont to \u201cbe the conserver of the body.\u201d91\nCohausen in the Hermippus, claiming \u201cthe most expert anatomists know\nfor certain that out of a [young and] sound body, a lively \u0002ying salt will\nbe breathed out, and this breath will have a vital strength and balsamic\ncapacity or at the least a powerful mechanical elasticity which communicates vigor, according to the precepts of the philosophers. . . .\u201d92 He\nthen stated, \u201cIt is true according to the opinion of Helmont . . . that the\nbreath penetrates the whole bodily system, even to the hairs, catching\nup volatile salts in its passage.\u201d93 Thus, because their blood circulation\n88\nCohausen, Helmontius Ecstaticus, p. 301.\nCohausen, Helmontius Ecstaticus, p. 137.\n90\nA list of Cohausen\u2019s unpublished manuscripts can be found in Jodocus Herman\nNunning, Commercii litterarii dissertationes epistolic\u00e6 historico-physico-curios\u00e6 J.H.

This section focuses on satirical and medical literature from the early modern period, particularly on patent medicines, alchemical satire, and theories of longevity:

1. <strong>Johann Cohausen</strong> (1665–1750) is highlighted for his satirical work *Hermippus Redivivus* (1742), which mocked the pursuit of immortality using contemporary medical and chemical ideas. Cohausen humorously exaggerated iatrochemical theories of the time, particularly those of <strong>Van Helmont</strong> (1580–1644) and <strong>Sanctorius</strong> (1561–1636), who were influential in the medical field. Cohausen’s satire entertained while simultaneously commenting on medical beliefs regarding respiration and life extension [Cohausen, *Hermippus Redivivus*, 1742, p. 189](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=189).

2. <strong>The Philosophers’ Stone and Life Elixirs</strong>: Cohausen’s *Hermippus* included humorous theories like life extension through inhaling the breath of young women, a twist on older alchemical ideas about philosophers’ stones and life elixirs. Cohausen proposed that such methods were equivalent to earlier chymical practices aimed at prolonging life, making his satire relevant to a society obsessed with health and longevity [p. 192](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=192).

3. <strong>Satire on Longevity and Chymical Medicine</strong>: The text explored how works like Cohausen’s were received by audiences and their impact on the public understanding of medical theories. These satirical works critiqued the exaggerated claims made by the purveyors of patent medicines, who often promised impossible cures [p. 199](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=199).

Van Helmont claimed that volatile salts were\nemitted through insensible perspiration, and Cohausen argued that the\npores were engaged continually in the aeration of the blood, inhaling\nand exhaling the surrounding atmosphere, taking up and discharging\natmospheric particles from the circulatory system; if the surrounding\natmosphere was healthy, the body would bene\u0003t, but if virulent, the body\ncould become diseased.97 Cohausen\u2019s assertion was of course a version\nof the miasma theory of disease, which natural philosophers such as\nRobert Boyle discoursed about the effects of ef\u0002uvia and the salubrity\nof the atmosphere on health.98 The Elementa chemiae of Leiden physician\nHerman Boerhaave also analyzed the virtue of plants diffused through\n97\nJoan Baptista van Helmont, Ortus Medicinae (Amsterdam: Elzevir, 1648; reprint,\nBrussels: Culture et Civilisation, 1966), pp. 178\u2013192; Cohausen, Hermippus Redivivus,\npp. 51\u201352. \u201cAccording to Hippocrates and other the nobles of Medicine, the human\nbody when healthy perspires through the open pores of the skin. [This is] because of\nthe incessant motion and the continuous circular course of the blood in which small\nparticles are incessantly emitted. Sanctorius weighed the mass of these excretions of\nthe body which bodies previously excreted . . . These ef\u0002uvia give out a scent through\ntranspiration and are of the nature of the body from which they are emitted, a sickening and harmful scent from those that are unhealthy, and a vigorous and sound scent\nfrom the youthful, and but when examined this emanation is humid and unctuous,\nand as one sweats it likewise condenses into a damp and fatty substance. Likewise the\nbreathing human body has pores and the absorbent vessels in the skin, through which\nlifeless bodies accept the outward animated corpuscles of exhalations. Undoubtedly,\nthe pores of the skin are engaged in the aeration of the blood, inhaling the surrounding atmosphere and then exhaling it again, reinforcing vital movements, or if the air\nis virulent, destroying life.\n[Corpus humanum juxta Hippocratem caeterosque Medicinae procures perspirabile est, quatenus per\nporos cutis in sanitate patulos ob continuum liquidorum motum sanguinis perpetua cirulatione attenuati\nparticulae sive ef\u0003uvia incessatur emittuntur, quae juxta staticen Sanctorii quascunque alias corporis\nexcretiones mole et aliquot librarum pondere . . . Ef\u0003uvia haec transpirata, seu per transpirationem emissa\ncorporum suorum redolent naturam; et uti ex aegrotantibus et cacochymicis insalubria et noxia, sic ex\njuvenilibus vegetis ac sanis non tantum vivida, sana et volatilia, sed et humido\u2014unctuosa excernuntur,\nquemadmodum et ipse sudor, qui ex transpiratis condensatis constat, humidus quoque et pinguis est.\nHumanum corpus inspirabile quoque est, idest habet poros et vasa absorbentia in cure . . .

Though he does not explicitly give\na reference to Van Helmont in this context, it is also possible Cohausen could have\nbeen in\u0002uenced by Helmontian writings on the weapon salve and magnetism, which\n\nPages 202:\npatent medicines and chymical satire\n185\nthe air and their subsequent medicinal effects; for instance postulating\nthat the ef\u0002uvia of the Poppy procured sleep, and the vapor of the\nyew was thought to be deadly to those who slept under it; van Helmont\nin his discussion of human breath, proclaimed that odors were more\nef\u0003cacious than liquid medicines, \u201cseeing that the Spirit of our life, since\nit is a Gas, is most mightily and swiftly affected by any other gas, to\nwit, but reason of their immediate co-touchings.\u201d99 Cohausen reasoned\nif the smells of Vegetables had such high effects, animal odors in the\nform of breath and sweat should even have stronger results. Therefore,\none could also imbibe not only the breath of healthy young people, but\nalso be bene\u0003ted by their perspiration exhaled through the skin.\nTo continue the formulation of his argument, Cohausen utilized the\nwork of Sanctorius, (1561\u20131636), a Paduan physician, on insensible\nperspiration. Sanctorius, inspired by physicians of classical periods\nwho discoursed on suppressed or obstructed perspiration, wrote that\nperspiration was \u201cabsolutely necessary to the well being of a Human\nBody. [Its production was] occasion\u2019d by the constant Circulations of\nthe Animal Fluids, and the forcible Contractions and Attritions of the\nSolids.\u201d100 Those parts of the \u0002uids and solids that were not necessary\nfor the nourishment of the body, \u0002ew out of the body through the\npores of the skin and mouth, meaning that it was necessary there be\na \u201cproportionate Recruit by daily food.\u201d101 By measuring the amount\nof insensible perspiration in the body and regulating one\u2019s diet, and\nkeeping the out\u0002owing of sweat and consumption of food at a constant\nlevel, one could regulate and preserve one\u2019s health.102 Sanctorius then\nargued that as the body aged, the solids and \u0003bres of the body grew\nhard, contractions in the tissues slowed and stopped, perspiration halted,\nand death resulted. In other words, the bodily tissues would lose their\ntonic motion of tissues and relevant organs. Tonus was a wide-ranging\nconcept in early modern medicine originally postulated by the Stoics\npostulated an action-at-a-distance mechanism of disease.

As the body\u2019s putrefaction [and\naging] continued, tonic motion worked to hold it in check.104\nCohausen agreed, writing in the Hermippus that \u201cThe body . . . is made of\nup \u0002uid and solid materials, and life depends on the incessant movement\nof the \u0002uids, especially the systole and diastole, but if the movement\nof \u0002uid stops, the body will die.\u201d105 However, Cohausen argued that\nthe bodily \u0002uids were constantly agitated not only through the blood\ncirculation, but by the operations of air currents which penetrated the\nbody through the pores and mouth. Although old age would mean\ngradual stoppage of \u0002uid movement and obstruction of the pores, if\nthe circulation of the \u0002uids was maintained by the infusion into the\npores and mouth of fresh vital forces in the air, such as from proximal\nyoung people, then life could be extended.106\n103\nJerome Bylebyl, \u201cThe Medical Side of Harvey\u2019s Discovery: The Normal and\nthe Abnormal,\u201d in William Harvey and his Age: The Professional and Social Context of the\nDiscovery of the Circulation, Henry E.

Cohausen related Pliny\u2019s account of Pollio, a soldier of the\nemperor of Augustus\u2014who when asked how he had managed to live\nover a hundred years replied: Melle intus, foris oleo, or \u201choney within,\noil without.\u201d107\nOther than anointing oneself on the outside, Cohausen felt it was\npossible to \u201coil\u201d the pores of the body from the inside by inhaling speci\u0003cally young female breath, as he claimed women were more oily or\nfatty than males. He utilized as his support the writings of the ancient\nMacrobius who claimed that in funeral piles it was important to lay\none fatty female body to six male bodies in a great pyre, as the male\nbodies would be more speedily consumed.108 After a facetious anecdote,\nwhere Cohausen claimed that the physician Fabricius knew of a lady\nwho emitted sparks when she combed her hair, he more seriously refers\nthe reader to his publication Lumen novum phosphoris accensum (1717) for\nevidence of the latent heat and \u0003re of women.109\nCohausen\u2019s Lumen was a serious scholarly effort submitted to the\nBordeaux Academy of Science (established in 1703) in competition for\na prize granted by the Duke of Force of 300 livres for the best answer\nto a proposed question. In this case, the prize committee requested an\nexplanation for the cause of light from phosphorus, a topic of much\ninterest in both continental and English natural philosophy; in 1674,\nBrandt of Hamburg \u0003rst obtained phosphorus from the \u201cMicrocosmic\neum quoque posse avertere senectutem, et sic vitam ultra centem pluresque annos facile protrahere.]\nCohausen refers the reader to his Decas for further discussion of tonus.\n107\nCohausen, Hermippus Redivivus, pp. 53\u201354.

In the third section of the Lumen, Cohausen praised\nthe arti\u0003cial \u201chermetic phosphorus\u201d discovered in 1673 by Christolph\nAdolph Baldouin, a magistrate in Saxony; it was an impure calcium\nnitrate (perhaps containing some sulphur) made from chalk and nitric\nacid, believed to be a potential alkahest.111 In his attempts to explain\nluminescence, Cohausen remarked in the Lumen, \u201cthere is in all things\na certain salt, which is nothing other than potential \u0003re,\u201d and he\nincluded observations on the development of molecules of \u0003re that\nexisted in the human body, including descriptions of some cases of\nspontaneous combustion; he believed them most prevalent in women,\nsupposedly occurring after they imbibed large amounts of brandy or\nspirits.112 From ideas such as these, Cohausen af\u0003rmed in the Hermippus\n110\nE.

On the other hand, Aristotle claimed that\nwomen, who were of moist and cold complexions, were shorter lived\nthan males, and that they were merely material and closer to the animal\nworld.114 As Guerrini has commented, \u201cThe ideal female of Vesalius, in\nimages which persisted for centuries, was literally more material than\nthe male, being \u0002eshy and voluptuous in contrast to the tautly muscled\nideal man.\u201d115 However, in Cohausen\u2019s medical work of the Enlightenment, the human body was less a vessel of Aristotelian humors than\na machine \u0003red by an internal chemical combustion engine; with this\nadvent of iatrochymistry and Cartesianism, Cohausen turned Aristotelian gendered assumptions on their heads, a not uncommon event in\nsatirical works which often invert accepted principles. Through their\nvery materiality, their fatty \u0002esh, women produced spirit, the ethereal\nvital breath.\nIndeed, whether he knew it or not, in his treatment of gender,\nCohausen was also in agreement with theories of insensible perspiration\nthat were modi\u0003ed by Newtonian physicians. As Newtonian physicians\nsuch as Pitcairne argued that the body was a hydraulic machine consisting of bodily \u0002uids, health would lie in the \u201cunobstructed circulation\nof bodily \u0002uids\u201d and in free perspiration and discharge of excreta.116\nIn the Emmenologia, a treatise on menstruation, John Friend asserted\nthe women discharged excreta through menstruation rather than via\n113\nCohausen, Hermippus Redivivus, p. 56.

In fact,\nin women insensible perspiration was . . . naturally obstructed. This was\ndue to a combination of factors related to the circulation of blood and\nthe secretion of perspirable matter. As the pulse of women was more\n\u201clanguid\u201d than that of men . . . women\u2019s blood circulation was less strong\nand less powerful. This meant the ori\u0003ces of the vessels of the female\nbody were too small to convey substantial amounts of perspirable matter,\nand women skin was too skin, its pores too small, to all proper excretion\nof perspirable matter.117\nIn a re\u0003guration of the Aristotelian premise that women were a defective variation of the male body, the Newtonian physicians used Friend\u2019s\nreasoning to argue that \u201cwomen\u2019s bodies were more unbalanced than\nthose of men.\u201d Women were less effective bodily machines.\nIf their bodies were more unbalanced, so were women\u2019s emotions.\nGuerrini has commented that over the course of the eighteenth century,\n\u201cthe medical de\u0003nition of the female changed from being primarily\nphysical to being primarily emotional: from body to spirit.\u201d118 Cohausen\nwitnessed this transition and utilized it for his medical and satiric purposes. If women were perceived as more sensitive and less emotionally\nbalanced in their nature as the eighteenth century progressed, there\nwas the danger that the \u201csensitive were also sensual, and more given\nto the pleasures of the \u0002esh, conforming to the older view of women\nas animal-like.\u201d119 In the Hermippus, Cohausen adhered to this caution,\nnoting that it is not the breath of any woman that was ethereal and\nlife-giving, but only those women who were healthy, young and chaste;\nvirgins were particularly effective in their life-giving powers.120 In answer\nto an objection raised in his text by his colleague Bishop Nunning, who\nin his own attempt to add hilarity to the Hermippus exhorted Cohausen\nto explain why Solomon with all of his wives had not lived a long life,\nCohausen claimed it was because Solomon was surrounded by women\n117\nDacome, \u201cLiving with the Chair,\u201d pp. 475\u20136.\nGuerrini, \u201cThe Hungry Soul,\u201d p. 279.\n119\nGuerrini, \u201cThe Hungry Soul,\u201d p. 285.\n120\nHere Cohausen may have been in\u0002uenced by Roger Bacon\u2019s recommendation\nthat the touch of girls, beautiful song, and the sight of beauty could give longevity.

The young man who\nmarried a rich old spinster in hopes of gaining money would trade his\nlife, as she would become youthful, and he prematurely aged.122 Old\nwomen were \u201clike cats, whose breath is poisonous to life,\u201d a reference\nto the age-old connection of cats to crones, witchcraft and female\nsexuality.123 As Cohausen explained, as women aged and became more\nsere and dry, their breath and sweat became more noxious, and more\nrepresentative of their supposed animalistic natures.\nIn the midst of Cohausen\u2019s advice to bottle female breath, to marry\nyoung wives, as well as his admonition to schoolteachers not to smoke in\nthe classroom, as they were denying themselves the volatile salts in the\nbreath of their charges, it would be evident to most readers that they\nwere in the midst of an effective satire which utilized medical theories\nof the day to accomplish a humorous end. To continue the joke, much\nin the manner of Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, Cohausen used the satiric\ndevise of including a series of encomiums and letters praising the Hermippus. One letter was from his friend Bishop Nunning, who had earlier\ncritiqued Cohausen\u2019s work with his example of Solomon; another from\n121\nCohausen, Hermippus Redivivus, chapter three, pp. 37\u201348 is entitled: [Resolvuntur\ngeminate autori ab Amico propositae Quaestiones: 1.

Cohausen launched his career\nby penning a work that did not promise any secrets to immortality,\nand ironically, he ended it in the same vein, no doubt disappointing\nhis more gullible readers much as the work by Dr. Behrens did to the\nmembers of the Bishop of Munster\u2019s court forty years earlier. Like\nBehrens, Cohausen proclaimed in a concluding verse that longevity\nwas not to be found in the breath of girls or the philosophers\u2019 stone,\nbut rather \u201cSed fato et Fortunae salutari, causis plerumque eventuum occultis\u201d\nor aging was due to the outcome of fortune, with unknown causes\nand outcomes.125\nIn the Helmontius Ecstaticus, Cohausen praised the hermetic vision of\nvan Helmont in which Helmont received the alkahest and the \u201cgemma\nrosae\u201d the perfect ruby or the philosophers\u2019 stone, and in the Decas, the\nphysician proclaimed it was humanity\u2019s purpose to search for the lost\ntree of life. Now, at the end of his own life, in his conclusion to the\nHermippus, Cohausen continued his verse satire with a poem dedicated\nto the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, which alchemists claimed\nheld the secret of the philosophers\u2019 stone and immortality.126 Pictorial\nrepresentations of the Emerald Tablet contained the Latin acrostic for\nthe volatile salt vitriol, as we have seen thought to be a possible source\nof the philosopher\u2019s stone: visita interiora terrae recti\u0002cando invenies occultum\nlapidem\u2014visit the interior of the earth, by rectifying you will \u0003nd the\nhidden stone. Cohausen\u2019s satiric reference to a volatile salt which supposedly held the secret of immortality could not be a more \u0003tting end\nto his work. Newman has noted that it was not until the beginning\nof the 1700s that alchemy was distinctly separated from chymistry,\n124\nCohausen, Hermippus Redivivus, p. 84.

As John Campbell\nwrote in the preface to his version of the Hermippus,\nThere is in this Dissertation such a mixture of serious Irony, as cannot but\nafford a very agreeable Entertainment to those who are proper Judges of\nSubjects of this Kind, and who are inclined to see how far the Strength\nof human Understanding can support philosophical Truths, against common Notions and vulgar Prejudices.128\nWe can only agree, for Cohausen\u2019s satire was worth its salt indeed.\n127\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, p. xiii.\nJohn Campbell, \u201cPreface,\u201d to Cohausen and Campbell, Hermippus Redivivus, or\nthe Sage\u2019s Triumph over Old Age, 1744 ed., p. iii.

He wrote:\nOthers say, that the air itself is not admitted into the blood, but only some\nactive, spirituous, and ethereal particles; that this vital spirit passes from the\nlungs to the heart and arteries, and at length become the animal spirits,\nwhich are by this means generated from the air. Others, who do not admit\nthat the animal spirits are derived from the air, still say that some other\nvital principle comes from thence. This vital principle MALPHIGHIUS\nsupposes to be saline vapour; LISTER, a hot, in\u0003ammable, sulphureous\nspirit . . . and BRYAN ROBINSON, the aerial acid, which preserves the\nblood from putrefaction; preserves also its density, and strengthens the\nanimal \u0002bres. For this reason he supposes it is we feel ourselves refreshed\nin cold air, as it abounds with a more plentiful acid quality.1\nIn his summary, Priestley was referring to a long intellectual tradition\nin seventeenth and eighteenth-century chymistry, analyzed in this book,\nwhich attempted to identify the vital principles in the air responsible for\nrespiration with a particular reactive chymical substance. The purpose\nof this chapter is to ascertain brie\u0003y to what extent these concepts of\na vital salt or saline acidic spirit survived in the Enlightenment. To\naccomplish this task, we will analyze the role of saline spirits or acids\nin the chemical revolution of Lavoisier. While Lavoisier\u2019s discoveries\n\u201crevolutionized perceptions of space and caused the old theories of air\nto be discarded,\u201d to what extent did they stem from speci\u0002cally older\nbeliefs about salts from English iatrochymistry?2 In other words, to\nwhat extent did the saline spirit or atmospheric acid become oxygen,\nthe acidifying principle?\n1\nJoseph Priestley, \u201cObservations on Respiration, and the Use of the Blood,\u201d Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 66 (1676), pp. 226\u2013248, on 229.\n2\nAlain Corbin, The Foul and the Fragrant: Odor and the French Social Imagination (Leamington Spa, Hamburg and New York: Berg, 1986), p. 139.\n\nPages 212:\nsaline acids to acidifying oxygen\n195\nOur analysis will begin with the work of dissenting minister Stephen\nHales in the Vegetable Staticks (1727), an innovative work inspired by Newtonian chymistry on the production of airs (gases) in which he utilized\na pneumatic trough or a pedestal apparatus to measure the amount\nof air released in a chymical reaction. Hales believed that aerial acids\nand volatile salts contributed to the elasticity and \u0002xedness of the air,\nproduced or absorbed gases, and affected human respiration. We will\nalso examine Hales\u2019 Philosophical Experiments, a series of discourses about\nsurviving long voyages at sea (1739) in which he analyzes sea salts and\ntheir exhalations in the atmosphere. In turn, we will then demonstrate\nto what extent Lavoisier was in\u0003uenced by Hales and the Newtonian\nchymical tradition of acidic saline spirits in the atmosphere.\nStephen Hales, Aerial Acids and Salts\nStephen Hales (1677\u20131761) was a dissenting minister, physiologist and\nchymist who was awarded the Copley medal by the Royal Society in\n1739, and as we have seen in chapter four, in\u0003uenced the work of\nNewtonian physician Bryan Robinson. In his seminal work, Vegetable\nStaticks (1727), Hales applied Newtonian experimental method to plant\nphysiology, further developing the chymical queries in the Opticks. The\nStaticks primarily included analyses to show \u201chow great a proportion\nair is wrought into the composition of animal, vegetable and mineral\nsubstances.\u201d3 As Francis Darwin realized, the foundation of Hales\u2019 views\non the nutrition and presence of \u201cairs\u201d in plants was based upon a\npremise of Newton\u2019s in which he postulated if fermentation progressed\nto its ultimate end, the compound putre\u0002ed, and the dense bodies rari\u0002ed into several sorts of Air; this Air by fermentation, and sometimes\nwithout it, was then formed into new mixtures or compounds.4 As Hales\nwrote of Query 30 of the Opticks, Newton \u201cobserves of air that dense\n3\nStephen Hales, Vegetable Staticks, History of Science Library, ed.

Hales also adheres to this premise in his Philosophical Experiments Containing Useful, and Necessary Institutions for such as undertake long voyages at Sea (London: W. Innys and\nR. Manby, 1739). On p. 34, he wrote, \u201cBut Putrefaction, that most subtile of all Dissolvents, effectually disjoins and separates all the component parts of putrifying Bodies . . . after the Putrefaction ceases, [the bodies] are formed into new combinations.\u201d\n\nPages 213:\n196\nconclusion\nbodies by fermentation rarity into several sorts of air, and this air, by\nfermentation, and sometimes without, returns into dense bodies.\u201d5 On\nthis basis Hales formed his theory of vegetable nutrition, concluding\n\u201cthat particles of air in a \u0002xt state\u201d adhere to and \u201care wrought into\nthe substance\u201d of plants.6 Hales thought of \u0002xed air as a unifying and\nbinding principle \u201cgreatly contributing in \u0002xed state to the union and\n\u0002rm connection of the several constituent parts\u201d of living and non-living\nmatter.7 Non-\u0002xed air, or free air however was inherently elastic.\nAlthough in modern terms, Hales did prepare a wide variety of\ngases in his experimentation, he did not think that the differences in the\nproperties of the free or \u0002xed \u201cairs\u201d he collected were due to chemical\nidentities. As Ecklund has noted, Hales\nviewed the differences he found in the air obtained from different substances as being due to the presence of impurities, which he referred to as\n\u201cfumes\u201d or \u201cvapours.\u201d . . . Hales was led by his faith in Newtonian atomism\nto explain the differences of properties in terms of an intermixing of particles of the impurities with those of the one true elastic substance\u2014air.8\nAs air was capable of union with other substances, Hales believed that\nupon such union, the \u0002xed air lost that elastic property associated with\nits free state.\nTo accomplish his analyses of airs and their \u0002xation into plants and\nanimals, as well as their impurities, Hales used an apparatus to collect\ngases over water in vessels separate from those in which they were\ngenerated. The substance that Hales studied was placed in a retort\nand heated; the retort was connected to a receiver suspended in water.\nIf air was driven off on heating the retort, then the water level in the\nreceiver would drop. If air was absorbed by the water, the water level\nwould rise, so the change in water level was a measure of the amount\nof gases produced or absorbed [See Figure 19].\nHales however had a different explanation for the rise and fall of\nlevels. In experiment 76 in Vegetable Staticks, Hales concluded,\nA good part of the air thus raised from several bodies by the force of\n\u0002re, was apt gradually to lose its elasticity, in standing several days; the\n5\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, p. 177.\nDarwin, \u201cSteven Hales\u201d, pp. 28.\n7\nMilton Kerker, \u201cHerman Boerhaave and the Development of Pneumatic Chemistry,\u201d Isis 46, 1 (March 1955), pp. 36\u201349, on p. 39.\n8\nJon Ecklund, \u201cOf a Spirit in the Water: Some Early Ideas on the Aerial Dimension,\u201d Isis 67,4 (December 1976), pp. 527\u2013550, on p. 540.\n6\n\nPages 214:\nsaline acids to acidifying oxygen\n197\nFigure 19.

To some extent, Hales here\nwas adhering to the chymistry of Newton in the Opticks, in which the\nair was \u201cimpregnated with subtle sulphur,\u201d as well as with acids; in the\nDe Natura Acidorum, Newton also discoursed about the extreme attractive\nqualities and chymical reactivity of acids. As Heinemann stated,\nHales considered that chemical processes were maintained by the production and absorption of gases by chemical substances, which he supposed\nbrought about by attractive and repulsive forces. Associating [free] \u201cair\u201d\nwith the alkali principle, he interpreted the interaction between acidic\nand alkaline substances in terms of the interactions between opposing\n[Newtonian] forces.10\nHales believed that the air lost its elasticity (decreased in volume) as the\nelastic particles of pure air were reabsorbed by the acid sulphureous\nfumes generated in the process. In other words, though \u201cmixtures do\nin fermentation generate elastick air . . . those which emit thick fumes,\ncharged with sulphur, resorb more than was generated in proportion to\nthe [acidulous] and sulphureousness and thickness of those fumes.\u201d11\nTherefore removing these acidic and sulphureous fumes would mean his\nair would not lose its elasticity.12 In their analyses of Hales\u2019 apparatus,\nParascandola and Ihde noted that Hales invented a method for solving\nthe problem of the loss of elasticity of the air:\nIn his attempting to remove the unwanted [acid and sulphureous fumes]\nfrom his air, Hales separated the generator from the collector and gave\nus the pneumatic trough. He was incidentally, successful to a large extent\nin his purpose of preventing the air generated from losing its elasticity,\nundoubtedly because in passing the air through water, most of the soluble\nfraction would be dissolved in the process.

Unlike Robinson who believed in the ef\u0002cacy of aerial\nsaline acids for breathing, Hales believed that elastic free air necessary\nfor respiration was inherently alkali. In fact, the result of his pneumatic\ntrough experiments demonstrated to him that acids, and in particular,\ntoo large a presence of acid sulphureous fumes in the atmosphere, could\nbe fatal to animal respiration. Burning sulphur (brimstone) in particular\n\u0003aming brimstone absorbed \u201cmuch air,\u201d and when he re\u0003ected\non the great quantities of elastic air, which are destroyed by burning\nsulphur; it seems to me not improbably, that when an animal is killed by\nlightening . . . it may be done by the air\u2019s elasticity, being instantly destroyed\nby the sulphureous lightening near the animal, whereby the lungs will\nfall \u0003at, and cause sudden death.14\nOn the other hand, experiments with volatile alkali salts such as vitriolic\ngrowths on pyrites and sal tartar generated a good deal of air.15 So,\nalkali salts would be bene\u0002cial to aiding respiration as they seemed to\ndrive off air in the heating of the retort.\nThese conclusions led Hales to experiment with breathing apparatus\ncoated with salts that would aid respiration in places abounding with\nacid sulphureous fumes, such as in mines or grottos. Hales\nbored a hole in the side of a large wooden fosset, and glewed into it the\ngreat end of another fosset . . . covering the ori\u0002ce with a bladder valve.\nThen I \u0002tted a valve b i, to the ori\u0002ce of the iron siphon s s, \u0002xing the\nend of the siphon fast at B into the fosset a b: Then by means of narrow hoops I placed four diaphragms of \u0003annel at half an inch distance\nfrom each other, into the broad rim of a sieve, which was about 7 inches\ndiameter. The Sieve was \u0002xed to, and had a free communication with\nboth ori\u0002ces of the siphon, by means of two large bladders i i n n o.\u201d\nIn his instrument, expired air had to pass though the diaphragms before\nbeing inhaled. Hales then dipped the diaphragms in strong solutions\nof salt tartar, noting he could breathe through the apparatus twice to\nfour times as long with the salty diaphragms as with uncoated ones, sal\n13\nParascandola and Ihde, \u201cHistory of the Pneumatic Trough,\u201d p. 356.\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, p. 147.\n15\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, pp. 101\u2013103.\n14\n\nPages 217:\n200\nconclusion\nFigure 20.

He\nalso believed that\nin several unwholesome trades, as the smelters of metals, the ceruss-makers, the plumbers, etc it might not unlikely be of good service to them\nin preserving them . . . from the noxious fumes of the materials they deal\nin by the use of such a salt-coated device.17\nThe power of air and its particulate components in \u201cchymical operations\u201d as well as in respiratory processes led Hales to conclude\nthe air is very instrumental in the production and growth of animals and\nvegetables, both by invigorating their several juices while in an elastic\nstate, and also by greatly contributing in a \u0002x\u2019d state to the union and\n\u0002rm connection of the several constituent parts of those bodies, viz,\ntheir water, salt, sulphur and earth. This band of union, in conjunction\nwith the external air, is also a very powerful agent in the dissolution\nand corruption of the same bodies, for it makes one in every fermenting mixture . . . elasticity is also not an essential immutable property of\nair particles; but they are, we see, easily changed from an elastick to a\n\u0002xt state, but the strong attraction of the acid, sulphureous, and saline\nparticles which abound in the air.18\nHales continued,\nsince this is the case, may we not with good reason adopt this now \u0002xt, now\nvolatile Proteus among the chymical principles, and that a very active one,\nas well as acid sulphur; notwithstanding it has hitherto been overlooked\nand rejected by Chymists, as no way intitled to that denomination?19\nAir, as well as the chymical fermentations between its atmospheric\nacids, sulphurs, and salts, was thus important to understand respiration\nas well as material change.\nHales\u2019 experiments with air in the Staticks and adherence to Newtonian principles led him to speculations about the source of the interactions between salts and the acidic sulphureous particles in the air\nin a later work, Philosophical Experiments Containing Useful, and Necessary\n16\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, p. 150.\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, pp. 153\u201354.\n18\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, p. 179.\n19\nHales, Vegetable Staticks, p. 180.\n17\n\nPages 219:\n202\nconclusion\nInstitutions for such as undertake long voyages at Sea (1739). Along with his\ninvention of a ventilators and breathing apparatus which improved\nsurvival rates when employed on ships, in hospitals and in prisons, Hales\nwas also concerned with water supplies on naval voyages. The desalination of water was also a predominant concern among the fellows of\nthe early Royal Society, a research question expressed in Hales\u2019 work.\nFirst, in his analysis of the puri\u0002cation of sea water, Hales came to\nthe conclusion that sea water consisted of common sea salt of a \u0002xed\nnature, and volatile salts, namely \u201cmore imperfect bittern salt and\nsulphureous bittern which last Principles promote Putrefaction, and\nare thereby Disjointed.\u201d20 Bittern traditionally was the mother water\nor lye which remains after the crystallization of common salt from sea\nwater; it contains sulphate and chloride of magnesium, bromine and\niodine. Distilling bittern salt resulted in the \u201csaline spirit\u201d of salt, in\nother words the saline acid. Hales\u2019 assertion that sea water consisted\nof \u0002xed and volatile salts is reminiscent of Thomas Philipot\u2019s theories\nof chymical models of tides (chapter three). Hales then speculated\nthat from the bittern salts that the \u201cuniversal salt arises, which as it\nhappens to fall on different earths, concretes and corrodes them, and\nthereby produces different types of salts . . . vitriol, alum, nitre . . . and sal\nammoniac.\u201d21 One of his supports for his assertion about bittern salts\nwas the fact that \u201cChymists observed that Nitre consists of an Oily\nSaline and Volatile Substance,\u201d so it was \u201cno wonder that Nitrous Salt\nshould be formed in the Bittern Salt and oily Bitumen of Sea-Water.\u201d22\nHe then concluded that because sea water had a good deal of nitrous\nsalts arising from bittern, seawater could not extinguish ships in \u0002res\nas well as fresh water, as nitre was exothermic and used in gunpowder.\nAnd, it was from the \u201cthe sulphurous Bitumen of the Sea, as raised by\nthe warmth of the sun, that subtle Sulphur form which the air, and\nits Waters, viz Dew and Rain are impregnated.\u201d23 He then concluded\nthat interactions between nitric acid arising from Bittern sea salts,\nand sulphur in the air from sea bitumen caused violent ferments in\nthe atmosphere resulting in thunder and lightening, the acid-sulphur\nfermentation again taken directly out of Newtonian chymistry. Hales\nconcluded from his analyses that puri\u0002cation of sea water was best\n20\nHales, Philosophical Experiments, p. 34.\nHales, Philosophical Experiments, p. 46.\n22\nHales, Philosophical Experiments, pp. 45\u201346.\n23\nHales, Philosophical Experiments, pp. 47.\n21\n\nPages 220:\nsaline acids to acidifying oxygen\n203\ndone by letting it putrefy, releasing the more disjoined bittern and\nsulphureous salts into the atmosphere, and then distilling it, whereby\nthe \u0002xed salt left over would be left as a caput mortuum (dead head) or\nas a distillation dreg.24\nAcids in the air and Lavoisier\nHales\u2019 work on the pneumatic trough and the chemical role of air and\nits saline acids was in\u0003uential in Britain and in the continent, and as\nGuerlac has shown, he was cited by most pneumatic chemists including\nJoseph Black and Lavoisier.25 The idea of a universal atmospheric acid\nwas also still common even until the 1770s; George Stahl, the inventor\nof the concept of phlogiston, mentioned the subject of acidi\u0002cation in\nhis treatise on salts. Stahl thought that vitriolic acid [sulphuric acid]\nwas the fundamental or \u201cuniversal acid\u201d and widespread in the atmosphere, an opinion shared by many eighteenth-century chemists.26 As\nCrosland has noted, the discovery of carbon dioxide or \u201c\u0002xed air\u201d by\nJoseph Black in 1754 provided the \u201cpossibility of a new direction to\nthe tradition\u2014the Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman suggested that\n\u201c\u0002xed air\u201d be called the \u201caerial acid.\u201d27 J.F. Meyer also postulated a\nuniversal acidum pingue a single acid, of which the other acids were later\nmodi\u0002cations, providing \u201can alternative explanation to that of Black of\nthe difference between mild and caustic (acidic) agents.\u201d28\nLavoisier himself was familiar with French translation of Meyer\u2019s\nbook, being impressed by his explanation that the gain in weight when\nmetals were calcined was due to the absorption of acidum pingue from\nthe \u0002re.29 Lavoisier also knew of J.F. Rozier\u2019s Observations sur la physique,\nin which Rozier postulated that air behaved in some ways like an\nacid. Rozier in 1772 wrote a treatise on wine in which experiments on\nfermentation were described; he suggested that the acidity of soured\n24\nHales, Philosophical Experiments, p. 33.\nHenry Guerlac, \u201cThe Continental Reputation of Stephen Hales,\u201d Archives Internationales d\u2019Histoire des Sciences 15 (1951), pp. 393\u2013404.\n26\nMaurice Crosland, \u201cLavoisier\u2019s Theory of Acidity,\u201d Isis 64, 3 (September 1973),\npp. 306\u2013325, on p. 309. Stahl believed nitric acid was a compound of this with phlogiston.

In the fermentation of beer wort . . . it is observed that a very\ngreat abundance of air is released as soon as the spirituous fermentation\nbegins. But when in the progress of fermentation the liquor begins to\nturn to acid, soon all the air that was released is re-absorbed to enter\ninto the composition of this acid. M. Abbe Rosier in his treatise on wine\nwas the \u0002rst to be struck by this phenomenon . . . it is easy to sense that\nthese experiments must inevitably lead to a completely new theory of\nfermentation.32\nLavoisier thus was thinking at this point about a connection between\nair and acidi\u0002cation, a connection made more manifest as he became\naware of Joseph Priestley\u2019s work on airs in 1773. As Crosland noted,\nLavoisier read Priestley\u2019s observations on the \u201cacid air\u201d obtained from\nmuriatic acid, and upon doing his own investigations in 1774 speculated that\nmarine acid [hydrochloric acid] is nothing but water impregnated with\nmarine air. It is roughly the same kind of thing with nitrous acid. . . .\nThere is every likelihood that \u0002xed air is nothing else but an acid in the\nstate of a vapour.33\nLavoisier then did his famous experiment on nitric acid in 1776, in\nwhich he brought together fractions of \u201cnitrous air\u201d (obtained by dissolving mercury in nitric acid, heating the residue, and collecting the\ngases) and oxygen, reforming nitric acid. Lavoisier also claimed that\nin the Memoir of his work that the air of the atmosphere is an acid\ncomposite of nitre and pure air. He stated,\n30\nRobert E.

Lavoisier claimed that oxygen was an appropriate\nname for his pure air, as it suggested a fundamental relationship between\nit and acids. These etymologies in his words were to \u201crelive the memories\nof beginners, who retain with dif\u0002culty a new word when it is absolutely\nempty of meaning.\u201d35 In his schema, salts were named in terms of the\nacids that they could become, and in his system he con\u0002dently named\n\u201ctwenty-two simple substances . . . not yet isolated, forming names from\nan individuating simple substance or radical and the relevant acid\u2014for\nexample\u2014\u201ccitric radical.\u201d36 The undiscovered bases of the undecomposed acids, he was sure would be readily uncovered now that the\nchemistry of oxygen was better understood. As he asserted,\nThat the number of the acids that one can form is again absolutely\nindeterminate, since one does not know all the substances that are likely\nto combine itself with the acidifying principle, and that one knows again\nless the means that one can employ to succeed in the combination.37\nIn this way, Lavoisier\u2019s nomenclature created a conceptual map to\nguide chemists through a terra incognita, a map that represented a new\nparadigm of the chemical revolution.\nAnd, even when oxygen was shown not to be a universal acidi\u0002er by\nBerthollet, Lavoisier\u2019s terminology stuck.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 201 to 222 of the document, which explores the following key topics:

1. <strong>Insensible Perspiration and Longevity</strong>: Building on earlier ideas from Van Helmont and Sanctorius, Cohausen discusses how the body excretes volatile salts through perspiration, and how these exhalations, along with the inhalation of healthy air, can prolong life. Cohausen also links the health benefits of inhaling the breath of the young to the classical theories of bodily humors and longevity [Van Helmont, *Ortus Medicinae*, 1648; Cohausen, *Hermippus Redivivus*, 1742, p. 201](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=201).

2. <strong>Cohausen&#x27;s Satirical Use of Medical Theories</strong>: Cohausen humorously describes the therapeutic benefits of &quot;bottling&quot; the breath of young women, and he plays with the ideas of gendered exhalations, drawing upon historical references and classical medical texts. He uses these satirical elements to criticize medical practices and ideas of the time, particularly regarding life-extending elixirs and the philosopher&#x27;s stone [Cohausen, *Hermippus Redivivus*, 1742, p. 210](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=210).

3. <strong>Transformation of Alchemical Principles</strong>: The section also touches on the gradual shift from alchemical to chemical principles, as Enlightenment figures like Lavoisier and others begin to separate alchemy from early chemistry. Cohausen&#x27;s work reflects this transformation, turning previously serious alchemical principles into subjects for satire and humor [p. 221](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=221).

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document contains several discussions about the <strong>transformation of alchemical principles</strong> into chemical ones during the early modern period. The process involved the gradual shift from mystical and metaphysical interpretations of substances to a more scientific and empirical approach. Here are some key insights:

1. <strong>Separation of Alchemy from Chymistry</strong>:
   - By the beginning of the 18th century, alchemy started to separate distinctly from chymistry (early chemistry). While alchemy focused on metaphysical concepts like the philosopher’s stone, chymistry began adopting empirical methods and focusing on reproducible results. This transformation was accompanied by skepticism and satire about traditional alchemical beliefs, such as in Cohausen&#x27;s *Hermippus Redivivus* (1742), which mocked the quest for immortality through alchemy [p. 209](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=209).

2. <strong>Paracelsian Influence</strong>:
   - Alchemists such as Paracelsus (1493–1541) were influential in shaping early modern thought about the tria prima (sulphur, mercury, and salt). However, as scientific methods evolved, Paracelsian ideas were critiqued and modified. For instance, while Paracelsus focused on analogical and spiritual interpretations, later chemists sought physical explanations for matter formation, especially concerning salts and acids [p. 24](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=24).

3. <strong>Integration of Aristotelian and Paracelsian Elements</strong>:
   - Early modern English chymists integrated Aristotelian and Paracelsian systems, combining traditional elements like earth, air, fire, and water with the tria prima. However, over time, empirical methods led to a more defined concept of substances, moving away from metaphysical explanations and towards more mechanistic understandings of chemical reactions [p. 26](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=26).

4. <strong>From Alkahest to Acids</strong>:
   - Figures like Johann Glauber (1604–1670) shifted from the pursuit of universal solvents like the alkahest (a core alchemical belief) to a focus on acids and their role in chemical reactions. This shift represents the broader transition from alchemical to chemical thinking, as acids became central to theories of fermentation, respiration, and digestion [p. 105](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=105).

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div><strong>Intellectual Biography of Paracelsus and His Concept of Salt</strong>

Paracelsus, born Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim in 1493, was a Swiss physician, alchemist, and philosopher who revolutionized early modern medicine and natural philosophy. His contributions to alchemy, chymistry, and medicine were groundbreaking, particularly through his rejection of traditional Aristotelian and Galenic models, and his embrace of a new, mystical approach to understanding the natural world. Central to Paracelsus&#x27; thought was his doctrine of the *tria prima*—the three primary substances that form the basis of all matter: salt, sulphur, and mercury. Among these, salt held a particularly significant place in Paracelsian cosmology and alchemical practice, symbolizing the corporeal and material aspects of the universe.

### Early Life and Education

Paracelsus was born in Einsiedeln, Switzerland, to a family involved in medicine. His father was a physician, and his early exposure to medical practices and local mining operations deeply influenced his later thinking about the relationship between nature, matter, and healing. He received a humanist education at various European universities, though he rejected much of the traditional scholastic learning he encountered. Paracelsus was critical of the heavy reliance on ancient authorities such as Galen and Aristotle, whose works dominated the medical curriculum of his time. Instead, he advocated for a more empirical, hands-on approach to both medicine and alchemy.

Paracelsus traveled extensively throughout Europe, learning from local healers, miners, and alchemists. These experiences shaped his belief that true knowledge of nature could only be acquired through direct observation and interaction with the natural world. His disdain for the bookishness of traditional scholars was well known, and he often claimed that his knowledge came from nature itself rather than from the ancient texts revered by his contemporaries.

### The *Tria Prima*: Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury

At the heart of Paracelsus’ natural philosophy was his theory of the *tria prima*, or three primary substances, which he believed were the fundamental building blocks of all matter. According to Paracelsus, every substance in the universe was composed of varying proportions of salt, sulphur, and mercury, each corresponding to different aspects of physical and spiritual existence. This concept of the *tria prima* was an adaptation of earlier alchemical ideas about the elemental nature of matter, but Paracelsus infused it with his own mystical and medical insights.

1. <strong>Sulphur</strong> represented the principle of combustibility and change. It symbolized the soul, or the essence that allowed for transformation and life. 
2. <strong>Mercury</strong> embodied volatility and fluidity, representing the spirit or the breath of life that animated living beings.
3. <strong>Salt</strong>, in Paracelsus&#x27; system, was the principle of solidity and stability, associated with the body and physical matter. It was the material residue left behind after combustion or transformation, symbolizing the corporeal and indestructible aspect of nature.

In Paracelsian thought, salt was crucial because it represented the physical manifestation of matter—what was left after the soul (sulphur) and spirit (mercury) had interacted and transformed. Salt was the crystallized essence of matter, and its stability made it essential for understanding how physical bodies were formed and sustained. This concept of salt had both a practical and symbolic significance in Paracelsian alchemy.

### Salt as a Chymical and Medical Principle

Paracelsus’ ideas about salt were not purely symbolic; they were deeply intertwined with his medical theories. He believed that the balance of the *tria prima* in the human body was essential for health. An imbalance in sulphur, mercury, or salt would lead to disease, and the task of the physician was to restore this balance through chemical remedies.

In medicine, salt represented the physical body and its processes of preservation and purification. Paracelsus used alchemical techniques to extract medicinal salts from various substances, believing that these salts carried the purest and most potent healing properties. His approach to medicine, which he called “iatrochemistry,” combined chemical and alchemical practices with the aim of purifying the body and restoring health through the application of salts and other substances.

One of Paracelsus’ most significant contributions to medical practice was his emphasis on chemical treatments for illness. At a time when most physicians relied on bloodletting and herbal remedies, Paracelsus advocated for the use of minerals, metals, and salts in medicine. He believed that diseases were caused by chemical imbalances in the body and that these imbalances could be corrected through the proper application of chemical substances. Salt, in particular, was central to his theories of detoxification and purification, as it was seen as the residue left behind after the body’s vital processes had acted upon impure substances.

Paracelsus&#x27; medical theories were revolutionary, not only because of his use of chemicals but also because of his holistic understanding of the body. He believed that the human body was a microcosm of the larger universe, and that the same principles governing the *tria prima* in nature also applied to the body’s health. In this way, his concept of salt as a stabilizing and purifying agent mirrored its role in the natural world.

### The Spiritual Significance of Salt

Beyond its physical properties, Paracelsus saw salt as a symbol of the body’s endurance and the material world&#x27;s connection to the divine. In his cosmology, salt represented the base and indestructible nature of creation. It was the &quot;residue&quot; left after the transformative processes of the soul and spirit, but this residue was not a mere byproduct. Rather, it was the crystallized essence of material reality, imbued with divine purpose.

Paracelsus also believed that salt had spiritual significance in alchemical transformations. In the alchemical process of calcination, for instance, matter was burned away until only the purified salt remained. This process symbolized the purification of the soul, with the physical salt left behind as a reminder of the material body’s connection to the spiritual realm. For Paracelsus, the alchemical transformation of matter mirrored the spiritual transformation of the individual, with salt playing a central role in both.

### Legacy and Influence

Paracelsus’ concept of salt, along with his broader theories of the *tria prima*, had a profound impact on both alchemy and the emerging field of chemistry. His work laid the foundation for later developments in chemical medicine, influencing figures like Robert Boyle, who carried forward the idea of chemical substances as fundamental to understanding the natural world. Paracelsus&#x27; integration of alchemy and medicine helped to shift these disciplines toward a more scientific approach, even as his mystical and spiritual interpretations remained influential.

While Paracelsus was often dismissed by his contemporaries as an eccentric or even a charlatan, his work has since been recognized as a crucial turning point in the history of medicine and alchemy. His emphasis on empirical observation, his rejection of ancient authorities, and his innovative use of chemical substances in medicine all contributed to the eventual rise of modern chemistry. His concept of salt, both as a material and spiritual substance, remains a fascinating example of the ways in which early modern thinkers sought to unify physical and metaphysical understandings of the world.

Paracelsus&#x27; legacy endures not only in the fields of medicine and alchemy but also in the broader intellectual history of the early modern period, where his ideas helped bridge the gap between the mystical traditions of the Middle Ages and the emerging scientific methodologies of the Enlightenment.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>That&#x27;s not quite what I meant by intellectual biography. Rewrite it to excise all the early life stuff and get straight to how his salt theory modified the existing alchemical theory of salt and mercury.</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Paracelsus (1493–1541), a radical thinker in early modern medicine and alchemy, brought a revolutionary shift to the understanding of matter and human physiology with his theory of the *tria prima*—sulphur, mercury, and salt. His reworking of alchemical principles, particularly regarding salt, modified centuries of tradition that had previously centered on the duality of mercury and sulphur as the fundamental elements in alchemical processes. Through his unique interpretation of salt’s role in both natural philosophy and medicine, Paracelsus introduced a concept of material transformation that profoundly influenced the transition from medieval alchemy to early modern chymistry.

### Traditional Alchemy: The Duality of Mercury and Sulphur

Before Paracelsus, medieval alchemical theory revolved around the interplay between mercury and sulphur, which were seen as the two essential components of all matter. This model, rooted in Aristotelian and Neoplatonic thought, posited that <strong>mercury</strong> represented fluidity and volatility, while <strong>sulphur</strong> embodied combustibility and transformation. Alchemists believed that the correct balance of these two principles was essential for the creation and perfection of metals, with mercury seen as the soul of metals and sulphur as the driving force behind their transformation.

In this traditional framework, the physical world was conceived as the result of a cosmic balance between these two elements. Mercury was often associated with the philosophical spirit, representing the volatile and elusive nature of the soul or spirit. Sulphur, on the other hand, symbolized the active, fiery principle that instigated change, often connected to the material body or soul.

### Paracelsus’ Innovation: The Introduction of Salt

Paracelsus introduced a third principle into this binary structure: <strong>salt</strong>. This addition was transformative, as it expanded the classical alchemical understanding of the natural world. While the duality of mercury and sulphur explained volatility and combustion, Paracelsus argued that <strong>salt</strong> was necessary to account for the stability and persistence of matter. In his model, salt represented the material, corporeal aspect of substances—their tangible, enduring essence.

In contrast to sulphur, which was the principle of transformation, and mercury, which was volatile and spiritual, <strong>salt embodied the solid and fixed aspect of matter</strong>. It was the residue that remained after other processes—combustion (sulphur) or volatilization (mercury)—had taken place. Paracelsus’ salt was the crystallized, physical essence, representing the body&#x27;s material aspect, both in human beings and in the natural world.

For Paracelsus, this concept of salt not only applied to metals and physical substances but also to the human body. Salt symbolized the body’s solid components, including bones and flesh, which were left behind after the spirit and soul had performed their vital functions. This understanding of salt as a foundational material element was a departure from earlier alchemical views that focused more on the fluid and transformative aspects of matter.

### Modifying the Alchemical Theory of Matter

Paracelsus’ introduction of salt fundamentally altered the alchemical theory of matter. Traditional alchemists had conceived of matter in terms of fluidity and transformation, symbolized by mercury and sulphur. By introducing salt, Paracelsus emphasized that matter also had a stable, material aspect that could not be explained by mercury and sulphur alone. His model of the *tria prima* suggested that all physical substances were composed of varying combinations of these three elements, with salt providing the material foundation.

Paracelsus’ salt was not merely a passive element; it had an active role in maintaining the integrity of matter. While sulphur burned and mercury volatilized, salt persisted, giving form and structure to the remains of transformation. In this way, Paracelsus integrated salt into the process of creation and transformation, giving it a significance that had previously been absent in alchemical thought. Salt was now seen as the stabilizing force that allowed matter to endure through change.

Moreover, Paracelsus applied his theory of salt to the human body, arguing that diseases were caused by imbalances in the *tria prima*. The body was composed of these three elements, and when salt, sulphur, or mercury became out of balance, disease would result. <strong>Salt represented the body’s material base</strong>—the flesh and bones. When the body’s salt was impure or corrupted, the physical structure of the body would suffer. This medical application of alchemical principles was another innovation of Paracelsus, marking a shift from purely metaphysical alchemy to practical, physiological medicine.

### Salt and the Rejection of Traditional Elemental Theory

Paracelsus’ theory of salt also represented a direct challenge to the traditional Aristotelian elemental system, which had dominated European thought for centuries. According to Aristotelianism, all matter was composed of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These elements were governed by the qualities of hot, cold, wet, and dry, and the interplay between these qualities determined the nature of substances.

Paracelsus rejected this system, arguing instead that the *tria prima*—salt, mercury, and sulphur—were the true elements of matter. In his view, the classical elements were secondary qualities derived from the *tria prima*. For example, salt could be associated with earth, sulphur with fire, and mercury with air and water, but these were not fundamental elements in themselves. Instead, they were manifestations of deeper, more essential principles. 

Paracelsus’ rejection of the classical elements was part of his broader critique of traditional academic and medical knowledge. He believed that the Aristotelian-Galenic system of medicine, which relied on balancing the four humors, was fundamentally flawed. In contrast, his chemical medicine was based on restoring the balance of the *tria prima* within the body. This reworking of medical theory was revolutionary, as it linked the health of the body to the chemical composition of matter, moving away from the humoral theories that had dominated Western medicine for over a millennium.

### Paracelsus’ Legacy: The Transition to Chymistry

Paracelsus’ modification of alchemical theory, particularly through his introduction of salt, helped to bridge the gap between medieval alchemy and early modern chymistry. By grounding his theories in the materiality of salt, Paracelsus laid the foundation for later developments in chemical science. His emphasis on chemical processes and the composition of matter foreshadowed the empirical approach that would come to define modern chemistry.

In the century following Paracelsus’ death, his ideas were taken up by figures like Johann Glauber (1604–1670), who emphasized the medicinal properties of salts, and Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who sought to establish a more scientific framework for understanding chemical substances. Boyle’s work on acids and alkalines was directly influenced by Paracelsian ideas, particularly the notion that salts could be used to purify and stabilize matter.

Paracelsus’ theory of salt, while initially controversial, became a key element in the transformation of alchemy into chymistry. His rejection of Aristotelian elements, coupled with his focus on the chemical composition of the body and the natural world, helped to shift the focus of natural philosophy from metaphysical speculation to empirical investigation. In this way, Paracelsus not only modified the alchemical theory of matter but also laid the groundwork for the development of modern chemistry.</div>

### <strong>Slide 1: Introduction to Paracelsus and Traditional Alchemical Theory</strong>
<strong>Title</strong>: Paracelsus and the *Tria Prima*

<strong>Content</strong>:
- <strong>Traditional Alchemy</strong>:
  - Before Paracelsus, alchemists focused on the duality of <strong>mercury</strong> (volatility) and <strong>sulphur</strong> (combustion), as the two primary principles of matter.
  - These elements symbolized the body (sulphur) and the spirit or soul (mercury) in alchemical processes.
  - Alchemists used these principles to explain the transformation of metals, weather phenomena, and even the body’s health.
  - Paracelsus introduced a third principle—<strong>salt</strong>, representing the physical body and material stability.

<strong>Quote from the book</strong>:
- “The tria prima became central to understanding how material and spiritual processes shaped both natural phenomena and bodily health, representing not just volatility and transformation, but also stability and physicality.” [Page 24](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=24)

From tidal motion to animal spirits, from metallogenesis to\nthe perceived key to longevity, salts and their acids played a persistent\nand predominant role in early modern natural philosophy and medicine.\nWe have seen that the study of saline spirits in the air and how they\naffected the animal oeconomy was a signi\u0002cant preoccupation for early\nmodern physiologists, leading them to regard salts as intrinsic to bodily\nprocesses. It seems that this tradition of chymistry also played a role in\nthe chemical revolution where the saline spirit became an \u201cacidifying\nprinciple.\u201d The concept of volatile salts as the vital element of life and\nmaterial change was therefore gradually modi\u0002ed into an understanding\nof respiration and combustion involving oxygen.\n38\nStephen Weininger, \u201cContemplating the Finger: Visuality and the Semiotics of\nChemistry,\u201d Hyle 4, 1 (1998), pp. 3\u201327, on p. 19.\n\nPages 224:\nAPPENDIX\nTRANSLATION FROM LATIN OF MARTIN LISTER\u2019S\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\nMartin Lister\u2019s Exercises on the Healing Springs of England is translated\nfrom the second edition.1 Lister\u2019s work met with great acclaim and was\nreviewed in the Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious, a publication in the\n\u201csame format as the French Journal des Scavans.\u201d2 The reviewer praised\nthe \u201cinquisitive and curious\u201d naturalist for his \u201cpiercing industry\u201d in\ncreating a history of \u201cEnglish Spaws,\u201d and in \u201cthe Discovery of such\nthings as relate to the natural Improvement of his own Country.\u201d3\nLister\u2019s thoughts on the chymistry of spa waters also had wider in\u0002uence in the Royal College of Physicians.

It can also mean\nthe \u201cmine\u201d itself. Lister uses it indiscriminately to mean all of these,\nand also \u201core\u201d and even \u201cmineral.\u201d\n4. \u201cVena\u201d has been translated as \u201cvein\u201d (of metal, of course), but often\n\u201core\u201d seems to be more appropriate, and at times this word is utilized\n5.

I have numbered the pages in the preface, pp. i, ii, iii, etc for convenience, as they are not paginated.\nPreface page i\nTo the Reader\nGreetings\nHere, for what it is worth, you have my earlier treatise on the Mineral\nSprings of England. I have thought long and hard before publishing\nit, so many are the factors which have held me back. There is the very\nsubject matter, which has been handled by the majority of my fellowcountrymen in such a way that, if I were to write about it, it seemed\ninevitable that I would cause disputes and quarrels with them, and I have\na great dislike of such discourtesies.5 Indeed, as in my other writings,\n5\nThe discovery of several mineral water springs at Scarborough and Knaresborough\nin 1626, and early accounts of these springs by Michael Stanhope were followed by\n\nPages 226:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n209\nI have nothing further to af\u0003rm, and no intentions which go beyond\ngiving an account of a phenomenon. For that alone is my unwavering\ntruth: any other currently-held \u0003xed opinions of mine may in a short\ntime cease to have my support (even if they have it now!). To what end\nthen should I defend them in a determined manner, if they \u0003nd fail to\nimpress some churlish fellow?\nPreface page ii\nIndeed this great obstinacy in debate is, in my opinion, a plague and\ndishonour to the Republic of Letters. In addition although I undertook\nthis work for relaxation I have been unable to complete it in scarcely\nany part because of the claims of business. I have also been prevented\nby ill-health, as I understand it. Yet I was reluctant to allow any correct\narguments or discoveries, however incomplete they may be, to be lost.\nAlso there is the fact that my second and better treatise is hardly in\nthe planning stage yet, and I concluded that it could not be properly\nunderstood without continual application and a long-standing experience of the places mentioned. Yet it is scarcely justi\u0003able that anyone\nshould reject the whole wide \u0003eld of medicine and devote his life to\nthe investigation of certain salts and their related soils. Furthermore\nI did not personally visit a large number of the lesser mineral springs\nof England, but I had their waters brought to me for examination,\nor else I speak using the trustworthy words of men who are experts\nin waters of their kind.6 The philosophers of Paris followed the same\nthose of John French and Robert Wittie. Wittie\u2019s chymical analysis of the Scarborough\nspa began a debate over the mineral content of the waters. One of the disputants\nabout the gall test (to test iron) in the waters was William Simpson (see chapter three),\nwho referred the dispute to the Royal Society. This is the controversy Lister was most\nlikely complaining about here. For more analysis of this debate see chapter three\nand Allen G. Debus, The Chemical Philosophy (New York: Dover, 2002), pp. 496\u20137. See\nalso Robert Wittie, Scarbrough spaw; or, A description of the nature and vertues of the spaw at\nScarbrough. Also a treatise of the nature and use of water (London: Charles Tyus and Richard\nLambert, 1660). An example of the debate in the Philosophical Transactions is: Nathaniel\nHighmore, \u201cSome Con\u0003derations Relating to D. Witties Defence of Scarborough Spaw\n(Abbreuiated in Numb. 51.) together with a Brief Accompt of a Less Considerable SaltSpring in Somersetshire; And of a Medical Spring in Dorsetshire; By the Learned Dr.\nHighmore in a Letter to Dr J. Beale at Yeavil in Somersetshire,\u201d Philosophical Transactions\n4, 51 (1669), pp. 1128\u20131131.\n6\nThis claim is borne out by Lister\u2019s vast correspondence about mineral waters and\nmineralogical specimens in MS Lister, Duke Humfrey Library, Bodleian, as well as in\nhis publications in the Philosophical Transactions, which are often letters to correspondents who have sent him mineral samples. Speci\u0003c examples will be enumerated in\nthe footnotes below.\n\nPages 227:\n210\nappendix\nprocedure, and they were also the very \u0003rst to complete an investigation of this kind.7\nPreface page iii\nAmongst my achievements the following is the most well-known, that I\nhave conducted an enquiry into iron and limestone (and I would certainly have done likewise in related \u0003elds if only I had had time) and\nacted on my own behalf in investigating their individual differences. It\nis my wish to distinguish between other materials found underground\nfollowing the precedent set in this way.\nHowever, in order to object to an assertion made by P. Guirius,8\nthe most recent writer on certain springs in France, I am not unduly\nimpressed by his salt of Alumen, about which he forcefully argues, after\nmaking a careful investigation of what D. Closeus had to say about the\nsame waters before the Philosophers of Paris.9 He should furthermore\nhave looked carefully at the shapes formed by crystalline salts of this\nkind, and he could not have done this from a few grains of some salt.\nLikewise in that author\u2019s works the ill-considered claim is made, contrary\nto the belief held by everybody else, that green vitriol, or, if you will,\n7\nHere Lister refers to the work by Samuel Cotreau Du Clos, the Observations on\nthe Mineral Waters of France, which was translated into English in 1684. Du Clos\u2019 work\nwas a systematic evaluation of the chemical content of all spa waters in France under\nthe auspices of the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, part of a larger project of\nchemical research which began in 1666 to \u201cdetermine rigorously the \u2018true principles\nof mixts [chemical compound]\u2019 by analyzing such bodies and by generating them and\nobserving their properties.\u201d See Samuel Cottereu Du Clos, Observations on the Mineral\nWaters of France, made in the Royal Academy of the Sciences . . . Now Made English (London:\nHenry Faithorne and John Kersey, 1684).\n8\nLister refers to Pierre le Givre, most likely to his Trait\u00e9 des eaux min\u00e9rales de Provins\nAvec le r\u00e9gime de vivre qu\u2019il faut observer en beuvant de ces eaux. (Paris: Chez Charles du Mesnil,\n1659).

However an excellent response to his\nother claims (those, that is, which are at variance with my \u0003ndings) is\nmade in this very treatise,\nPreface page iv\nassuming that they require no fresh rebuttal.\nI have named those very springs which others call ferruginous, \u2018inky\nblack\u2019 [atramentosos], in a manner of speaking, from their appearance.\nThey have been called by others, who follow Pliny, after their taste, but\nby me after the effect they have when in contact with galls.10\nIndex page v\nIndex of Chapters\n1.

Iron gall ink was made from crushed galls, water, and iron II sulphate (vitriol)\nand gum arabic to keep the pigment suspended. The reference here is of course to\nNatural History. Galls were used in the early modern period in a color-change test for\nthe presence of iron in spa waters.\n11\nSalt of lime is calcium carbonate (CaCO3) precipitated from limewater (calcium\nhydroxide solution, Ca(OH)2) by a carbonate compound.\n\nPages 229:\n212\nappendix\nIndex page vi\n6.

See Chapter three for Lister\u2019s disputes with van Helmont\nover the generation of vitriol.\n\nPages 230:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n213\nPage 2\nyet because is is the most plentiful of all, it should rightly be categorized in the class of salts. It is of course salt, or nitre of lime (nitrum\ncalcarium).13\nSince however we have given an accurate description of all the shapes\nof all these salts, we shall, in my opinion, shortly establish with greater\ncertainty some things about the salts of mineral springs, by making a\ncomparison between the salts of each type.\nA description of vitriol\nTo resume, green vitriol is born from iron pyrites; when its crystals are\nmature and perfectly formed, they are invariably sharpened or pointed\nat either end, and consist of ten uneven and \u0002at sides.\nOne may see in the middle four \u0002at pentagonal sides, and they possess three \u0002at triangular surfaces at each of their pointed extremities,\nas represented in the \u0003rst \u0003gure.\nPage 3\nII. A description of alumen (alumen or alum).14 I have \u0003ltered lye from the\nmetallic form of alumen after burning it and then keeping it for a long\ntime and drying it. It produced white crystals shaped in the following\nmanner: their shape is a little compressed; on the one side, or, as one\n13\nAfter his classi\u0003cation of common salts, Lister turned to an analysis of salts in\nEnglish mineral waters, and concluded from isolation by dehydration and crystal analysis\nthat only two types were present: nitrum calcarium derived from limestone (calcium carbonate) and common sea salt. Lister thought that the presence of sea salts in English\nmineral springs was easily explained via the runoff of sea water inland. But nitre of\nlime, or what he called nitrum calcarium was a different case. Lister commented that\nnitrum calcarium was produced by the exposure of limestone to air. This was \u0003rst because\n\u201cwhere there is nitre of lime, there is always limestone to be found,\u201d and because Lister\nobserved that \u201cno salt whatever grows from limestone immediately after it has been\nslaked by the application of heat, but the same stone produces an abundance of salt,\nwhether it [ie. the stone] has been untreated or heated, whilst forming the walls or roof\nof some house; it then grows together to form crystals of its own kind.\u201d Most likely\nLister was observing the formation of potassium carbonate or saltpetre crystals on\nwalls that had been whitened by limestone, similar to the formation of nitre crystals\nin limestone saltpeter caves. Lister noted that nitrum calcarium could also not be formed\nby steeping limestone in water, and indeed nitrate crystals will not form in areas of\nexcess humidity.\n14\nMost likely aluminum sulphate (alum), though it could be alumen which was a\nmixed double salt of aluminum sulphate with potassium sodium or ammonium sulfate.\n(Potassium salt, when pure, was also commonly called \u201cAlum.\u201d). (Al2(SO4)3 \u0004 K2SO4 \u0004\n24H2O); (Al2(SO4)3 \u0004 (NH4)2SO4 \u0004 24H2O); (Al2(SO4)3 \u0004 Na2SO4 \u0004 24H2O).\n\nPages 231:\n214\nappendix\nmight say, at its peak, it has a \u0002at hexagonal surface, whilst on the other\nopposite side it rests upon a \u0002at base which is similarly hexagonal. Its\nsides are bounded by three hexagonal \u0002at surfaces, interposed alternatively by two quandrangular \u0002at surfaces each, and so each whole crystal\nof alumen is made up of eleven \u0002at surfaces, that is, of \u0003ve hexagonal\n\u0002at surfaces and six quandrangular \u0002at surfaces. The particular crystal\nwhich I have described weighed about 50 grains. See Figure 2.\nN.B. The simple and basic development of all salts should be noted\nthoroughly and carefully. For where it is\nPage 4\n. . . advanced for a longer time, the crystals indeed appear to grow\nlarger. But this usually happens through a certain chance conjunction\nof several pure primary salts, from which confusion arises regarding\nthe true and natural shape of crystals.15\nA description of common salt III. If salt water is boiled to dryness, and\nthe salt is then once more dissolved in a little spring water, it produces\ncrystals which are truly cubic. See \u0003gure 3.\nYet in the central part of the upper side, or, if you will, \u0002at part, a\nsort of transparency can be observed, which is unblemished because\nof a lack of substance [within that part of the crystal], or emptiness. Yet\nthe remaining \u0003ve sides are solid and whitish.\nA solution of our so-called sal gemmae has displayed the same cubic\ncrystals to me.16\nI obtained the same results from common salt obtained by boiling\ndry salt water drawn from the inland regions of our island.\nPage 5\nFurthermore concerning the sea-salt made from sand in the estuary\nof the Lune [Lancastriensi],17 I have additionally noticed salt of this\nkind develop into a brilliant white \u0002uted mass while it is still in solution\nbefore it has been brought to dryness by heat, just as can be observed\n15\nHere we see Lister\u2019s interest in crystallinity as an indicator of chemical structure,\na common conceit of the time. See Norma Emerton, The Scienti\u0003c Reinterpretation of\nForm (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1984) for an analysis of crystallinity in early\nmodern science.\n16\nSal gemmae is sodium chloride or \u201ccommon salt.\u201d\n17\nLancastriensi refers to Lancashire, as the Lune River \u0002ows down from the Pennines\nand Eastern Lane District towards Lancaster.\n\nPages 232:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n215\nin the case of fused antimony or a certain kind of stone of gypsum.\nYet this same mass is dissolved in spring water, and grows in its entirety\ninto crystals of a cubic shape, like other sea salts which I have already\nmentioned.\nSea salt differs completely from the salt of inland springs in kind, and\na clear distinction must be drawn in every respect between seawater\nand fresh water. For the crystals of seawater are cut short at each of\nthe corners, to form individual \u0002at triangles, on at least one side of the\nsquare, but the crystals formed from saltwater have undamaged corners.\nAs far as I aware I am the \u0003rst person to record this. See \u0003gure 8.\nPage 6\nA description of nitre. IV. Nitre, which some call saltpetre and halopetrum,\ndevelops into hexagonal crystals, which are thin, long and of unvarying width. These crystals, I say, have sides shaped like parallelograms.\nFurthermore they end, on one side only, in a sort of point or tip, which\nis sharpened in a pyramidical fashion owing of course to the varying\nposition of the two \u0002at sides. On the other side however the crystals\ndo not have a polished appearance, but invariably end as though they\nhad been broken off prematurely. I would give a warning here that\nnobody should be deceived about the shape of nitre, which I am the\n\u0003rst to sketch out and make known, but which I see has recently been\nincorrectly described by somebody else. See \u0003gure 4.\nIt should further be observed that this sharpened point, which we\nhave stated is shaped rather like a cone on the one side of each crystal\nof nitre, is formed from the very end of the prism,\nPage 7\nand that the body of the prism itself is to no extent made narrower. I\nam aware that many have dreamt this feature up and carelessly applied\nit to crystals of nitre.\nI am speaking however of the simple and primary growth of these\ncrystals: For this does appear at times to happen as a consequence of\na chance combination of several crystals.\nBut the following difference should be noted, that those which combine in this way by chance can also be ultimately restored to a perfect\nshape of their own type, if they are dissolved in water once more.\nApart from hexagonal crystals formed from a solution of saltpetre,\nyou will also \u0003nd not infrequently in the same solution (if the salt is\n\nPages 233:\n216\nappendix\ninadequately puri\u0003ed) other polygonal cubic crystals of some kind or\nother. If these are all gathered together separately and made into a\nfresh solution they either turn into the crystals of nitre described above\nor, if they are of a different source, they make their origin clear.\nPage 8\nFurthermore when the aforementioned saltpetre is placed on a \u0003re, it at\nonce catches light with a thin \u0002ame and is completely consumed with\na considerable noise, and leaves behind nothing of the death\u2019s head,18\nor, as the (al)chemists love to say, the colcothar.19\nV. There is in addition a certain kind of salt, which some call mural\nnitre [nitrum murale\u2014nitre found on walls] and which we call nitre of lime\n[nitrum calcarium], because it usually develops from limestone, whether\nuntreated or treated with heat on the very old walls of buildings.20 I shall\nnow be the \u0003rst, as far as I am aware, to give the shape and description\nof this lesser known salt (even though, at least in England, it is the most\ncommon of the salts which can be dug from the ground.)\nWell, the crystals of this salt are thin and long, and in the middle\nare four parallelogram-shaped sides, but these are usually of unequal\nsize. On the one side the point itself is formed from two \u0002at triangular\nsides:\nPage 9\nOn the other opposite side it has two \u0002at squares, which are placed so\nas to be constantly opposite the part described earlier. The larger of\nthese crystals are about half a \u0003nger long. See \u0003gure 5.\n18\nThe \u201cdead head\u201d; the nonvolatile residue left over in the bottom of a retort or\nalembic after distillation.\n19\nThe colcothar could be a \u201cdead head\u201d but it usually referred more speci\u0003cally to\nresidue produced by roasting copper sulfate; it is composed mostly of copper oxide.\nThe residue from the roasting of iron vitriol (ferrous sulfate) is also called colcothar\nand is composed of iron oxides. Please see William Newman, \u201cAlchemical Glossary\u201d\nin \u201cThe Chymistry of Isaac Newton.\u201d http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/reference/glossary. Accessed 22 August 2006.\n20\nBefore industrialization, a major source of nitre was the deposits crystallizing from\ncave walls or privies, or other organic matter that was decomposing. Ammonia from\nthe decomposition of urea in dung heaps would produce nitrate, and nitre-beds were\ncultivated in the early modern period by mixing manure and ashes, along with straw\nto create a compost pile; the compost pile was periodically kept moist with urine and\nleached with water. The liquid containing the nitrates was then converted with ashes\nto potassium nitrates which were re\u0003ned into gunpowder.\n\nPages 234:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n217\nThere are several other varieties of this salt, because some have \u0003ve\nsides in the middle, etc, individual examples are described with their\nparticular shapes in the table.\nThis salt also grows entirely into the crystals already described when\nit is once more dissolved, even though you may obtain only a few\nundamaged and perfect crystals at each attempt.\nIt is also a feature of the nature of this salt of lime that if placed on\na \u0003re it clari\u0003es without a \u0002ame and grows into bubbles, and grows hard\nlike deep white pumice, which is clearly after the fashion of alumen.\nPage 10\nChapter II\nConcerning veins of iron. It is af\u0003rmed that there is only one pyrite in England,\nand this and this is entirely composed of pure metallic iron.\nUp to this point we have described all our fossil salts, although certain soils are correctly considered as the parents, so to speak, of some\nof those salts. A ferrous vein is of course the parent of green vitriol,\nand limestone of salt of lime; it will be my intention to give a brief\nexplanation of those underground substances. I shall however begin\nwith ferrous underground substances.\nI shall give an honest account of the accidentals and properties of\niron as far as I have understood them by personal inspection.\nIt is particularly true, as was once suggested by Pliny, namely, that of\nall the underground substances an abundant vein of ferrous material\ncertainly occurs nowhere in England\nPage 11\nBut I do not accept that distinction drawn by my fellow-countryman\nGilbert (On the Magnet Book 1, chapter 8) who distinguishes between\na metallic vein of iron and some kind of ferrous material, and so\nwould have it that a great part of our island of Britain is ferrous.21\nFor I consider it most certain that all loamy soil, or, if you will, every\nvein containing stone, which, either in its raw state or heat-treated\nand prepared in any way whatever, is attracted by a magnet, can be\n21\nA reference to William Gilbert, On the Magnet, \u0003rst ed. (London, 1600). Duane\nH.D. Roller, The De Magnete of William Gilbert (Amsterdam: Menno Hertzberger, 1959).\nNot all sources of iron ore are of course magnetic.\n\nPages 235:\n218\nappendix\nmelted down into iron. Accordingly, if some mistake is made in a furnace, either by supplying insuf\u0003cient heat or otherwise, it should not\nimmediately be blamed upon a metallic vein, as though it did not truly\nshare in the nature of iron.\nI have decided here to describe the proof of a metallic vein of iron\nin accordance with what Agricola says (Book 7, page 194).22 For the\nindividual ferrous substances to be named below have been carefully\ninvestigated in accordance with this procedure.\nPage 12\nWe prove (he says) a vein of iron in the forge of a blacksmith. It is\nheated, reduced, washed and dried. A magnet is placed on the scrapings collected by washing, which attracts the iron \u0003lings to itself. These\nare wiped off with a feather and collected in a crucible; the magnet is\ncontinually left on the scrapings collected by washing, and the \u0003lings\nare wiped off, until the magnet attracts what remains to itself. This is\nthen heated with saltpetre in the crucible until it lique\u0003es and from it\na little lump of iron melts from it. If the magnet quickly and easily\nattracts the \u0003lings to itself, then we conjecture that it is a rich vein of\niron, but if this happens slowly, we conjecture it is a poor one. If of\ncourse the magnet appears to want to have nothing to do with it, we\nconjecture that it contains either little or no iron.\nThe magnet \u00a7 1. The magnet is a very particular vein of iron. It is, I\ndeclare, the best metallic form of iron, and attracts to itself all other\nferrous substances, be they raw or heated, as has just been shown\nabove.\nPage 13\nThe magnet which I have obtained from land in the British county of\nDevon, is a blue-black color, and a little darker than polished iron\nitself. When it is broken up, its interior is like marble, and it attracts\n\u0003lings made from itself as though they were melted-down iron.23\n22\nLister is referring to Agricola, De Re Metallica. (Basel: J. Froben and N. Episopius,\n1556). For a fascinating exploration of the relationship between mining and movable\ntype, see Pamela O. Long, \u201cOf Mining, Smelting, and Printing: Agricola\u2019s De re metallica,\u201d Technology and Culture 44, 1 ( January 2003), pp. 97\u2013101.\n23\nMagnetite is often found in East Dartmoor in Devon, and pyrrotite, a slightly\nmagnetic iron pyrite, can be found in North Dartmoor.\n\nPages 236:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n219\nThe vein which \u0002ashes, like sandstone \u00a7 II. In the second place I submit for\nconsideration the red-colored vein of iron, which \u0002ashes like sandstone.\nThis, I declare, has a sort of purplish color, of a less intense blue-black.\nIt consists of unequal and sharp particles, like iron \u0003lings, one might\nsay. For in whatever manner you break it, it always has this appearance,\nand (to omit nothing of what I have observed about this substance)\nthis is considered the exact appearance of Swedish iron ore, which has\nalways quite deservedly been considered the best in Europe.24 But the\ncolor of the Swedish ore is less blue-black than almost green.\nPage 14\nAt least this is what all the examples sent to me from twelve diggings\nlook like without exception.25 Furthermore when it is crushed to the\npowder we spoke of but in a raw state and as yet untreated by \u0003re the\nmagnet still attracts it, but it does not follow the magnet as readily as\nthe ore from Sweden. When this is raw and unheated obeys the magnet\nas if it were pure iron. This is the most certain indication of the best\n24\nMagnetite is a main component of most igneous rocks and is often present as\nminute crystals. Large deposits are considered to be the result of magmatic segregation,\nas in the Urals, and Northern Sweden, in Kiruna and Gellivaare.\n25\nThe series of letters to and from Lister kept in the Duke Humfrey Library at the\nBodleian illustrate that Lister was receiving large amounts of mineral samples from\ncolleagues, some of which he passed onto the Royal Society Repository. MS Lister 34\nin particular shows that iron samples were being sent to him by Francis Jessop. For\ninstance in Letter 80, fol. 186r, Jessop wrote to Lister:\n. . . . I have gotten together some two pices of severall oares &amp; that is all. I have\nsome pieces of my lord devonshires copper ore, a piece of Iron ore which I call\nIron mine of which they say they can make Iron with more ease than ordinary,\nif I be not mistaken (for it is a great while since I \u0003rst received it) they told me it\nwould melt downe into good Iron with the \u0003rst heat. I have some pieces of lead\nore with pebles sticking in such a manner in ye very body of the ore, that I am\napt to believe that lead ore doth grow in the earth &amp; hathe growne about these\nstones. As also a piece of very pure ore wch they tell me yields 3/4 lead which\ngrowes betwixt a rock of gritstone on ye one side &amp; a bed of fullers earth, as they\ncall it on the other which I take to be nothing but calke.

Yet our type of vein is not entirely lacking in this property.\nFinally this stone of ours is very heavy, as are most of the ores from\nwhich iron is smelted. This stone is found near a ridge in the chalk hills\nof Yorkshire,26 not far from a little town called Warter.27\n\u00a7 III. In the same chalk hills surrounded by this enormous border\nanother red-colored vein of iron reveals itself in huge numbers of places.\nPage 15\nAt times it is quite soft, rather like a kind of clay, and at other times it\nis harder, and also traces red lines when it is pressed on paper. Unless it\nis well-heated it does not attract the magnet, but in this ore too, which\nis only moderately rich in iron, there are what I might call kernels or\nroundish knots of iron, like mustard seeds, but the size of a boy\u2019s head.\nThese are as hard as marble, and can easily be polished and smoothed\nso that they shine. If they are broken they reveal a smooth and \u0002at\nsurface, they have a reddish-black color. When held they do not stain\nthe \u0003ngers red.

Hematite contains\n27\n\nPages 238:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n221\nof ferrous substances, but they have a particular ore, which is called\nhaematite.\nThis stone too is found there with varying appearances. It therefore\nreceived various names from the ancients, and even our fellow-countrymen. At times, like fused antimony, it develops a long drop-like formations, which face some central point, at other times it resembles bunches\nof grapes so that it is called botrytes [Greek for \u2018bunches of grapes\u2019].\nAt times it exhibits a smoothness like pure silk, an extreme smoothness\nwhich is perceived by the \u0003ngers like a piece of lard. I have observed\nall of these accidentals within one and the same stone; so diverse is\nthe nature and in consequence the names of this ore.\nPage 17\nIn addition this same haematite is at times soft, like pure loam, and can be\nhandled just like clay. At times it is haematite of the purest kind, at other\ntimes it is mixed in very small quantities with lead-bearing limestone.\nYet all these ferrous ores, when rubbed on paper, freely trace a vivid\nred line, with a certain gleam, like that of some fused metal. In this\nrespect haematite (to pass an incidental observation) resembles that\nunnamed underground substance, which we Britons call black-lead,\nwhich as far as I know is found nowhere else in Europe except Westmorland, where haematite also greatly abounds.\nThis ferrous ore has its own particular excellence, that outstanding\niron is produced from it without any previous \u2018fusio in Regulum.\u201929 Even\nmere heating over a \u0003re is suf\u0003cient to harden it into iron with blows\nfrom a hammer.\nPage 18\nThere exists today in the aforesaid little town in Westmorland a furnace\nmade solely of this substance.

Likewise I possess another type of haematite greatly praised by\nour metallurgists from Wales. This however has a noteworthy hardness\nand a color ranging from red to a suggestion of blue-black. With its red\nhue it shows a similarity to a kind of selenite,30 and likewise it does not\ntrace a red line, nor is it attracted by a magnet in its raw form. The\nturning of this stone too into iron is said to be easy.\nThe vein of iron in sand. \u00a7 V. The following veins of iron are nowhere\nfound in loose sand or sandstone.\nPage 19\nThese veins have an almost light blue-black color, which at times\napproaches a redness. The stones are sometimes \u0003ssile, or \u0002at; at times\nthey resemble a concave tile; from time to time they are solid smooth\nstones, whilst at other times they are mixed with the sand. If they are\nhard, they could in some way be used as substitutes for emery. At times\nthe same sandy veins are nothing but soft loam.\nAetite. Aetite is found in those stones which are concave, and contains\nwithin itself a whitish or yellow inner part.31 These stones however are\nnaturally uneven and rough, and a certain attractiveness is added to\nthem when they are polished.\nLoamy fossil ochre. In sand the metallic form of loamy ochre is not\ninfrequently found, as at Santon Sands in Lincolnshire, where once a\ngreat quantity was mined from a vein of the same substance.32\n30\nSelenite (chemical formula: CaSO4 \u0004 2H2O) is a hydrous calcium sulfate, meaning it is composed of oxygen, sulphur, hydrogen, calcium and water.

Iron oxide can add red tints to\nselenite, which is probably the phenomenon to which Lister referred.\n31\n\u201cAetites, also called Aquilaeus or eagle stone, is a stone said to have magical\nproperties, particularly connected to childbirth. It is mainly composed of iron oxide,\nwith some \u0002int and alumina, and is hollow with a loose nodule which rattles around\ninside. The stone was said to be found inside the stomach or neck of an eagle, or in\nits nest, hence its alternative name. It was said to heal epilepsy and prevent premature\nbirth.

But unless they\nare well burned and subjected to much manipulation in \u0003re they are\nnot attracted by a magnet.\nPage 20\nBut when this is done, they yield wholly to the magnet.\nThis underground substance is found almost anywhere where sand\noccurs naturally. I could certainly name very many such places, but I\nam content with a few in Yorkshire, near Kirkham and Weston, where\na great many stones are to be had which resemble aetite, but are for the\nmost part solid.33 Likewise I found some from time to time near Wentbridge, where one vein has an outstanding purple hue, and certainly\nto the south of the little town on the very ridge of a hill.34\nMetallic iron in the neighbourhood of fossil coal from pure layers of rock, both\nsolid and widely spread. \u00a7.

The ruins of this twelfth-century Augustinian Abbey are situated close to the river. Weston is a parish town, also in Yorkshire in\nthe West Ridings, and by the nineteenth-century was the site of an old quarry, which\nmay have been the source of mineral wealth that Lister describes.\n34\nThis is Wentbridge, and Lister is describing the wearing of the Great North\nRoad, or Watling Street, the primary Roman Road. The water is the River Went.\nThe underlying geology of the site is Middle Coal Measures sandstone overlain with\nriver alluvium.\n\nPages 241:\n224\nappendix\nsquared stones, as though they were hand-made by some industrial\nprocess, which are joined together like paving stones. They are also\ncalled \u2018gallystones\u2019 by our well-diggers, for some reason or other.35\nSome small examples of these squared stones can be found in great\nquantities on a certain little farm called Kel\u0003eld near Pockley in the\nneighbourhood of Helmsley in Yorkshire; at all events it is the best\nsubterranean form of iron.36\nLikewise there are other roundish balls, which our fellow-countrymen call \u2018hareballs\u2019,\nPage 22\nwhich are all sizes ranging from the common nut to a millstone.37\nMany places in Yorkshire have gained a reputation from these veins,\nsuch as Bentley in the neighbourhood of Black Barnsley and Adderstone etc.\nThese ores however are smashed into tiny bits and heated before\nbeing melted, and in the melting are mixed with limestone,38 then the\nore is poured into the puri\u0003ed liquid and hardened into iron by many\nviolent hammer blows.\n35\nI have not been able to trace the source of the term \u201cgallystone.\u201d\nHelmsley is quite near Rievaulx Abbey, where the Cistercians made a good deal\nof pro\u0003t mining iron and lead. The Department of Archaeology at the University of\nBradford has done several site digs of bloomeries or iron furnaces in the area. According\nto their researchers, \u201cOver the last eight years ironworking sites in the Rievaulx and\nBilsdale area have been surveyed. Numerous early \u2018bloomery\u2019 sites have been identi\u0003ed;\nmany of these probably date from the medieval period. These bloomeries were small\nfurnaces, cylindrical in shape, about 0.5 m in diameter and probably less than 2m in\nheight. These furnaces were built of clay, fuelled by charcoal, used local ore and were\nblown by hand or foot bellows. There is evidence of continued ironworking after the\ndissolution of Rievaulx Abbey at Laskill in Bilsdale using \u2018high\u2019 bloomery, and later\ncharcoal blast furnace, technology. The blast furnace was built adjacent to the Abbey\nruins in 1570, and was closed circa 1670.\u201d See http://www.brad.ac.uk/archsci/depart/\nresgrp/amrg/NYM.HTM.

This is removed by the limestone. When the limestone is heated in the furnace\nit decomposes to lime (calcium oxide) and oxygen. This calcium oxide reacts with the\nsand to produce slag, calcium silicate, CaSiO3, which \u0002ows away, allowing the iron to\nbe extracted from below.\n36\n\nPages 242:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n225\nLikewise if these ores are puri\u0003ed by repeated melting, they produce\na much more durable and excellent iron, as is proved by the iron workers near Kirkstall Abbey in Yorkshire.39\nIn the melting itself a certain green substance, which is truly glasslike, and no longer capable of being dissolved again, \u0002oats on top of\nthe metal itself.40\nBut the magnet shows no recognition of any of these ores, unless\nthey receive a thorough and long-lasting heating.\nPage 23\n\u00a7 VII. Ferrous ores found in marl. Ferrous ores found in Sussex,41 from\nwhich the King\u2019s artillery is cast, are as follows:\n1. The one which my fellow-countrymen call \u2018Ball-mine\u2019, that is, spheroid ore. It is found beneath a certain whitish clay. This stone however\nis like a whitish kernel covered by a red husk. These, although the best\nform of ferrous ore, are quite rare. When heated for a long period,\nthey become entirely red, and only then are attracted by a magnet.\n2. A red ore marked with white veins, lies about three feet under the\ntype described in note 1.\n3. A third type also reddish, lying the same depth below the second\ntype. It is called \u2018pettee mine\u2019 by our fellow-countrymen, possibly\n39\nKirkham Abbey, Yorkshire, is near what is now known as the River Derwent. The\nruins of this twelfth-century Augustinian Abbey are situated close to the river.\n40\nGreen glassy slag is typical of a furnace using limestone as a \u0002ux. See the Mining History Pages at http://www.people.ex.ac.uk/pfclaugh/mhinf/bp_iron.htm. See\nalso http://iron.wlu.edu/ or The Smelter\u2019s Art for iron production methods done with\nbloomeries and a discussion of slag.\n41\nIron production in Sussex centered about the Weald, hilly county south of London\nthat contains a band of iron ore which has high phosphorous content. The Romans\nbegan working iron there, supplying the metal for the army and northwest \u0002eet, and\niron production continued in the medieval and early modern period with iron bloomery\nand then blast furnaces. As Richard Cowen has noted, \u201cin 1242 the Archbishop of\nCanterbury was asked to provide 8000 horseshoes and 20,000 nails from his estates in\nthe Weald, to be delivered to Portsmouth, almost certainly for Henry III\u2019s campaign\nin France that year. The largest order for which we have records was in 1253, when\nthe Sheriff of Sussex had to provide 30,000 horseshoes and 60,000 nails.\u201d With the\nmilitary aggression of Henry VIII, \u201cby 1574 there were 110 furnaces and forges in\nthe area, producing several thousand tons of iron, including several hundred tons of\ncannon.\u201d By the seventeenth century, iron-production in the Weald declined due to\ncompetition from cheaper Swedish ore.

It also has red layers.\nPage 24\n4. The fourth and lowest ore: these last three are laid down like paving stones: the two earlier ones are softer, the last two are harder,\nand since they melt more easily they are more productive of iron.\nLikewise this fourth ore has red layers, interspersed with ochre here\nand there as is the case in certain sandy veins of iron. In addition\nthe last two are believed to be hot, and are more easily cast than the\nothers, no doubt on account of the sulphurous element of vitriol.\nYet if ever these ores are found in bluish marl, they are scarcely able\nto be processed. It is credible that this fault arises from an excess of\nvitriol. But in white marl they are of excellent quality.\nOchre which is turning red arises from pyrites. \u00a7 VIII. Ochre which is turning red or dark yellow is usually produced from pyrites, and is certainly\nfound in most inky-black mild acids, is pure metallic iron.\nPage 25\nAfter the requisite heating it is wholly attracted by a magnet.\n\u00a7 IX. Pyrites. One pyrite found in England is the very purest metallic\niron, and should be considered most productive when it forms a vein of\niron. It is distinguished from the other veins of iron because it is vitriolic\npar excellence, and almost gleams with a certain silver or golden shimmer.\nLikewise when it is struck by steel it produces sparks if it is hard. The\nmoderns call the stone marcasite after the Moors. It is found in mines\nof all metals and discovered in great variety. Some is gold, and some\nis silver, as far as color is concerned; it may be smooth, \u0002uted, soft,\nhard, of the utmost purity, and a unique ore, which is found mixed in\nvarying proportions, now very small, now fairly sparingly, with lead,\ntin, bronze and alumen ore.\nPage 26\nLikewise it is to be found with black \u0002int, fossil coal, limestone, chalk\nand many other underground substances. Some are without exception\ncube-shaped, others resemble layers of parchment. Some have tuberlike roots, others are like round hail-stones or balls of any size; some\n\nPages 244:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n227\nare polygonal, others like honeycomb.42 It would be an endless task\nto describe all their individual differences. Yet I should like to add a\nfew things about some of them which I have observed personally with\ncareful investigation.\n1. Pyrites can be found which are internally \u0002uted, roundish, tuber-like\non the outside and at times polygonal. Their \u0002utes point inwards\ntowards some central point, like fused antimony, or like the description we gave above about a certain haematite.\nAmong these however there are some which produce their own vitriol\nin plentiful quantities in moist places. They are found wherever cretaceous stone occurs, but usually\nPage 27\nin a scattered vein.\nThey are called \u2018rust balls\u2019 by our fellow-countrymen, at least in the\nquarries near Foulmore in Cambridgeshire, and likewise everywhere in\nthe Yorkshire Wolds. Concerning these Glauberus tells some amazing\nfacts in his own fashion.43\n2. Other pyrites of a golden color are found in the same locality, and\nespecially in lead bearing rocks and among fossil coals, which are\ncube-shaped and in some way full of corners.\n3. At times, especially where fossil coals abound, and elsewhere, huge\nlayers of rock are found consisting of nothing but pyrites; some are\nthin, but others are thick, a foot and a half and more, as I have\nobserved amongst other places near Bentley Hall, in the aforesaid\nvalley of Latherden, near Craven.\n42\nPyrites are a pale brass-yellow mineral, the bisul\u0003de of iron, FeS2. It occurs most\ncommonly in crystals (belonging to the isometric system and usually in the form of\ncubes and pyritohedrons) but is also found in massive, granular, and stalactite form. As\ndescribed in chapter three, it often has a vitriolic varnish, and was used in the production\nof sulphuric acid. Two pieces of iron pyrites, which, when struck together, throw off a\nshower of hot sparks that will last for at least a second. Iron pyrites and steel will also\ngive a hot spark. Pyrites were used as well as \u0002ints in early modern wheelock arms.\n43\nSee chapter two for an analysis of Glauber and his \u201cdiscovery\u201d of sal mirable and\nits relationship to pyrites and vitriol.\n\nPages 245:\n228\nappendix\nFurthermore in these layers of pyrites some stones are soft and fragile,\nbut others are very hard\nPage 28\nand clearly \u0002int, so that they can be pierced only with much dif\u0003culty,\nwhich causes great inconvenience to metal-workers, as is the case in\nthe coal mines near Colne in Lancashire.\n4. Likewise other pyrites are found in the shape of certain tiles among\nthe rocks in Derbyshire, where they are commonly called chertstones.44\n5. The pyrites found in tin-mines are called mundy45 and maxy46 by our\nmetal-workers, but they are none other than common pyrites, although\nthey are a metallic iron conspicuous for its golden or silver splendour.\n6. Likewise I have obtained other pyrites, which possess an elegant\nsilver sheen, in the coalmines not far from Wake\u0003eld.\n7. Likewise I have obtained golden pyrites mingled in the middle of black\n\u0002int. This stone is however only very rarely found in our chalk hills.\nPage 29\n8. Likewise I have obtained pyrites mixed in various ways with lead\nore. At times it is entirely covered with pyrites as though by a husk.\nAt times there is very little mixing between the substances, but in\nsuch a way that at times even to the naked eye the pyrites is inserted\nlike a knot in the other ore. At other times one can uncover this\nmixture only with the help of a magnet, and then only after the\nrequisite heating.\n9.

1. <strong>The Role of Saline Spirits and Acids in Early Modern Natural Philosophy</strong>:
   - Salts were seen as essential in explaining processes such as respiration and material change. The idea of a <strong>vital element</strong> being tied to salts evolved into the concept of oxygen as the &quot;acidifying principle&quot; in the chemical revolution.
   - This theory linked back to older alchemical traditions, where salts were vital in understanding bodily functions and natural phenomena. [Page 223](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=223).

2. <strong>Martin Lister&#x27;s Study on Spa Waters</strong>:
   - Lister’s influential work on <strong>healing springs</strong> in England was foundational in the study of saline chemistry. He investigated the crystallization of salts and their medicinal benefits.
   - His work spurred interest in the Royal College of Physicians, leading to a broader examination of mineral waters and their chemical properties. [Page 224](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=224).

As we have seen, the basis for his treatments was an extension\nof the acids-alkali theory of the humors which had its origin in the\n1660s among iatrochymists on the Continent in\u0002uenced by van Helmont\nand Sylvius.188\nInstead of using acids or alkalis to \u201crestore the balance of the humors,\u201d]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=20\nPages: 20\nthe salt principle, and increasing emphasis upon acidic saline spirits as\nthe fundamental movers in chymistry, natural processes and medicine\nin the \u0002rst half of the eighteenth century. As Ecklund commented,\n\u201cin the eighteenth century salts gradually became to be thought of in\nterms of process, as, for example, the product of the reaction between\nacids and bases, acids and other salts, or between two salts, etc. Some\nchemists regarded acids . . . themselves as salts or at least some saline\nsubstances.\u201d5 Indeed, Chambers Cyclopaedia (1728) de\u0002ned salt as a\n\u201csimple acid substance.\u201d6 In the early eighteenth century, the formative\nqualities of volatile salts were also thought to be an aid to longevity.\nBefore oxygen was \u201cdiscovered,\u201d acidic saline spirits were perceived to\nbe the source of life\u2019s breath, revealing not only the origins of the idea\nof smelling salts, but early theories of respiratory physiology.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=125\nPages: 125\ninterest in the salt principle began to decline. Belief in the salt principle\ndiminished, and there was growing interest in the idea of a universal\nacid as the basic mover in processes of nature; it was usually identi\u0003ed\nas sulphuric acid.1 As Emerton has noted, in the seventeenth century,\nit was believed that acids or \u201csaline spirits\u201d were the most powerful\nchemical agents, and they were increasingly important in the chemical\nlaboratory as chemical reactions in solution predominated over older\ndistillation processes.2 The use of acids and alkalis in iatrochymical\ntreatments of Boerhaave and Franciscus Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius (1614\u20131672),\nas well as Boyle\u2019s re\u0003nement of colored indicators in detecting acidity\nled to this shift in emphasis.\nAfter a brief contextual discussion of the rise of acids and alkalis\nin chemical and iatrochymical theory, we will start this chapter with a\ndiscussion of William Simpson.

From tidal motion to animal spirits, from metallogenesis to\nthe perceived key to longevity, salts and their acids played a persistent\nand predominant role in early modern natural philosophy and medicine.\nWe have seen that the study of saline spirits in the air and how they\naffected the animal oeconomy was a signi\u0002cant preoccupation for early\nmodern physiologists, leading them to regard salts as intrinsic to bodily\nprocesses. It seems that this tradition of chymistry also played a role in\nthe chemical revolution where the saline spirit became an \u201cacidifying\nprinciple.\u201d The concept of volatile salts as the vital element of life and\nmaterial change was therefore gradually modi\u0002ed into an understanding\nof respiration and combustion involving oxygen.\n38]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=211\nPages: 211\nwhich attempted to identify the vital principles in the air responsible for\nrespiration with a particular reactive chymical substance.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The role of <strong>saline spirits</strong> and <strong>acids</strong> in early modern philosophy, particularly between the 17th and 18th centuries, marks a significant transformation from the earlier alchemical understanding of salts as static, material elements to more dynamic agents influencing chemical and physiological processes.

### <strong>1. Transition from Alchemical Salts to Saline Spirits</strong>
In early modern philosophy, particularly among chymists influenced by <strong>Paracelsian</strong> ideas, <strong>salts</strong> were initially viewed as a stabilizing, corporeal element—one of the *tria prima* (sulphur, mercury, salt). However, by the 17th century, attention shifted towards <strong>saline spirits</strong> and <strong>acids</strong> as the primary agents in natural processes. The shift was reflected in the increasing importance of acids in chemical reactions and their role in respiratory physiology and material transformations.

- “Salts gradually became to be thought of in terms of process... chemists regarded acids... as the most powerful chemical agents.” [Page 20](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=20).

### <strong>2. The Rise of Acids in Iatrochymistry</strong>
In <strong>iatrochymistry</strong> (chemical medicine), acids and saline spirits were recognized for their ability to affect bodily processes, such as respiration and digestion. Early modern physicians like <strong>Johann van Helmont</strong> and <strong>Franciscus Dele Boë Sylvius</strong> advanced the acid-alkali theory, which explained physiological imbalances and disease as a result of excess acidity or alkalinity in the body.

- “Acids or ‘saline spirits’ were the most powerful chemical agents in both the laboratory and medicine, influencing the rise of alkali-acid therapies.” [Page 125](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=125).
- <strong>Van Helmont</strong> (1580–1644) played a major role in these ideas, suggesting that vital forces in the air and body were influenced by acids, which he believed were more fundamental than salts alone. His notion of <strong>volatile salts</strong>—the vitalizing agents in respiration and digestion—laid the groundwork for the chemical revolution&#x27;s focus on acids.

### <strong>3. Acids and Respiration: A Precursor to Oxygen</strong>
The role of acids extended beyond bodily fluids and influenced early theories of <strong>respiration</strong> and <strong>atmospheric phenomena</strong>. By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, natural philosophers began to speculate that <strong>acids in the air</strong>—what they called &quot;saline spirits&quot;—were necessary for combustion and life, predating the discovery of oxygen.

- “Before oxygen was discovered, acidic saline spirits were perceived to be the source of life’s breath, and early respiratory physiology relied on the idea of volatile acids in the atmosphere.” [Page 20](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=20).

<strong>Bryan Robinson</strong> (1680–1754) extended these ideas, applying them to his theories of <strong>elasticity</strong> and <strong>animal spirits</strong>. He posited that acid particles in the air combined with the blood, preserving life through a process analogous to chemical effervescence, which was key to early understandings of respiration.

- “The basis for his treatments was an extension of the acids-alkali theory of the humors... the elasticity and health of the animal fibers were directly affected by these chemical interactions.” [Page 169](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=169).

### <strong>4. Chemical Revolution and the Decline of Alchemical Salts</strong>
By the 18th century, with the rise of figures like <strong>Lavoisier</strong>, the understanding of acids evolved. Lavoisier’s work on the role of <strong>oxygen</strong> in combustion and respiration effectively transformed earlier ideas about saline spirits into the modern understanding of gases. This discovery helped move the study of salts and acids from the domain of alchemy into modern chemistry.

- “Salts and their acids played a persistent and predominant role... but the vitalizing spirit of acids was transformed into the acidifying principle in the chemical revolution.” [Page 223](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=223).
- <strong>Joseph Priestley</strong> (1733–1804) furthered this transformation by experimenting with <strong>airs</strong> (gases) and proposing that a vital spirit—later identified as oxygen—was responsible for combustion and life processes, marking a shift away from the idea of &quot;saline spirits&quot; as the key agents in respiration.

### <strong>5. Acids in Material Transformations</strong>
Acids were also recognized as agents of <strong>material change</strong>. Early chemists observed that acids could dissolve metals, transform materials, and catalyze reactions. Alchemical ideas about salts gradually gave way to more empirical understandings of how acids functioned in chemical processes.

- “The concept of volatile salts as the vital element of life and material change was therefore gradually modified... acids became central to theories of respiration and combustion involving oxygen.” [Page 223](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=223).

This transition represents the broader evolution from <strong>alchemy</strong> to <strong>chemistry</strong>, as the metaphysical significance of salts was replaced by an empirical focus on acids and their role in <strong>chemical reactions</strong> and <strong>natural processes</strong>.

### Conclusion
The shift from <strong>saline salts</strong> to <strong>acids and saline spirits</strong> in early modern philosophy marked a turning point in the understanding of chemical processes and natural phenomena. Initially rooted in alchemical traditions, the theory of acids gradually became central to medical and natural philosophy, leading to the eventual discovery of oxygen and the transformation of alchemy into modern chemistry. Through the works of figures like <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Robinson</strong>, and <strong>Lavoisier</strong>, acids became the foundation for a new understanding of life, matter, and chemical change.

This chapter\nwill demonstrate that at the end of the seventeenth century however,\ninterest in the salt principle began to decline. Belief in the salt principle\ndiminished, and there was growing interest in the idea of a universal\nacid as the basic mover in processes of nature; it was usually identi\u0003ed\nas sulphuric acid.1 As Emerton has noted, in the seventeenth century,\nit was believed that acids or \u201csaline spirits\u201d were the most powerful\nchemical agents, and they were increasingly important in the chemical\nlaboratory as chemical reactions in solution predominated over older\ndistillation processes.2 The use of acids and alkalis in iatrochymical\ntreatments of Boerhaave and Franciscus Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius (1614\u20131672),\nas well as Boyle\u2019s re\u0003nement of colored indicators in detecting acidity\nled to this shift in emphasis.\nAfter a brief contextual discussion of the rise of acids and alkalis\nin chemical and iatrochymical theory, we will start this chapter with a\ndiscussion of William Simpson. Simpson was a physician from York who\nsettled in Chapel Street in London, a chymist and an English Helmontian who was representative of this shift from salts to saline spirits.\nSimpson\u2019s father was a brewer, and he himself has been described as\nan experimentalist more comfortable in the laboratory than the study.3\nSimpson\u2019s concept of the fermentation of saline spirits or acids in the\natmosphere and the body, discussed in his Zymologia Physica (1675) owed\nsome of its premises to Van Helmont, some to the Iatrochymical School,\nparticularly the works of Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius and Tachenius, and some\n1\nRobert P.

The nature of Simpson\u2019s\ntheories of fermentation has been largely neglected in scholarly analysis,\na state of affairs likely due to focus upon his disagreement with both\nMartin Lister (see chapter three) and Robert Wittie, another chymist\nand analyst of spa waters. The dispute centered upon about the role of\nsalts and saline spirits in the spa waters and metallogenesis. Dr. Robert\nWittie published Scarborough Spaw in 1660 which advocated the waters\nas a cure for all ills, recommending that the waters were best drunk\nmid-May to mid-September and inadvertently initiating the summer\nseason in spa towns. In his Hydrologica Chymica (1669) Simpson refuted\nWittie\u2019s claims made for the mineral spring waters, and the medical\ndebate spread beyond local boundaries to the Royal Society in London.4\nBut there was more to Simpson than his role in this debate. When we\nturn to Simpson\u2019s tracts on fermentation, we will also see that although\nit is generally true Newtonianism caused the decline of Van Helmontian\nmedicine and chemistry in England, that Simpson was an important\ntransitional \u0003gure combining Newtonian ideas about acidic fermentation with Helmontian ideas about volatile salts.5\nWe will then subsequently analyze the role of saline chymistry in the\ntreatises of early eighteenth-century Newtonian physicians after Simpson. It has been well documented by Guerrini that Newtonian physicians\nsuch as Bryan Robinson (1680\u20131754), Archibald Pitcairne (1652\u20131713),\nGeorge Cheyne (1671\u20131743) and Richard Mead (1673\u20131754) posited\na \u201cNewtonian physiology\u201d based on the premises in the Principia, as\nwell as queries in Newton\u2019s Opticks (1704\u201322) and the De Natura Acidorum (1710).6 Her emphasis however was primarily in the application\nof Newtonian physics and conceptions of the aether to medicine; I\nwill concentrate in this chapter instead upon Newton\u2019s chemical works\nabout salts and acids and their in\u0002uence in the medical community in\nBritain and Ireland.\n4\nWilliam Simpson, Hydrologia chymica, or, The chymical anatomy of the Scarbrough, and\nother spaws in York-Shire: wherein are interspersed, some animadversions upon Dr. Wittie\u2019s lately\npublished treatise of the Scarbrough Spaw . . .

The section on <strong>page 125</strong> explores the historical shift from the prominence of salts in early modern chymistry to the increasing importance of <strong>saline spirits</strong> and <strong>acids</strong> as the primary agents in chemical and natural processes. This shift, which occurred towards the end of the 17th century, marked the decline of the traditional belief in <strong>salts</strong> as fundamental, with a growing emphasis on acids—especially <strong>sulphuric acid</strong>—as the driving force behind nature’s transformations.

Key ideas include:

1. <strong>Decline of Salt Theory</strong>: 
   - The notion of <strong>volatile salts</strong> as the vital spirit in natural processes, championed by <strong>Van Helmont</strong> and the early Helmontians, began to lose its dominance. In its place, acids, particularly <strong>sulphuric acid</strong>, gained prominence as the <strong>universal agent</strong> of chemical and physiological processes.
   - This shift was supported by the increasing role of acids in <strong>chemical laboratories</strong> as more attention was paid to reactions in solution, leading to a transition from older distillation techniques to methods based on acid-alkali reactions.

2. <strong>Rise of Acids in Iatrochymistry</strong>:
   - <strong>Iatrochymists</strong> like <strong>Boerhaave</strong> and <strong>Franciscus Dele Boë Sylvius</strong> (1614–1672) used acids and alkalis in medical treatments, furthering the theory that acids played a vital role in bodily functions. For instance, acids were seen as critical in <strong>digestion</strong> and the management of bodily fluids.
   - The use of acids in <strong>medical chemistry</strong> aligned with <strong>Boyle’s refinement</strong> of colored indicators to detect the presence of acidity, thus improving the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in medicine.

3. <strong>William Simpson and the Transition</strong>:
   - The page introduces <strong>William Simpson</strong>, an English Helmontian physician and chemist who was representative of this shift. In his work *Zymologia Physica* (1675), Simpson argued for the role of <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>saline spirits</strong> (or acids) in both the atmosphere and the human body, blending <strong>Newtonian ideas</strong> about acidic fermentation with <strong>Helmontian theories</strong> of volatile salts.
   - Simpson’s work marked an important transitional phase, combining older alchemical ideas with newer chemical theories about the role of acids, positioning him as a significant figure in the evolution from salt-based theories to <strong>acid-based chemistry</strong>.

### Broader Context:
- This shift from salts to acids represented the broader transition from <strong>alchemy to modern chemistry</strong>. In the early 18th century, natural philosophers began to regard acids not only as chemical agents but also as the <strong>vital spirits</strong> in respiration, combustion, and other natural processes. This laid the groundwork for the eventual discovery of <strong>oxygen</strong> as the acidifying principle in chemical reactions, a key development in the <strong>chemical revolution</strong>.

A sort of white sand, and likewise the white deposit which adheres\nto the bottom of pitchers is deposited from them, especially if the\nwaters are boiled in iron vessels. This is also true of sea-water,\nwhenever it is similarly boiled down to salt. Yet neither sea water\nitself nor the inland wells at Droitwich produce any stony sand when\nthey dry out by themselves or are boiled in a leaden vessel.54\nN.B. If the white sand, which is deposited from the waters described\nabove in the course of boiling, is in some way soaked in rainwater and\nkept in a wet condition, after a few months it will produce new crystals\nfor you which closely resemble alumen. I have accurately drawn a most\nelegant example of these of the\nPage 37\ncorrect size and shape, see \u0003gure 7. The base of this is wholly \u0002at, and\nit also has a \u0002at vertex which is much broader. The circumference which\ncontains the whole is octagonal, but I could scarcely see the nature of\nthe \u0002at surfaces of which each side of it consisted. It has a salty-bitter\ntaste. Likewise if the crystals were pressed together in the month of\nJuly, then a few months later they entirely lost their shape and turned\nwithout interference into a white powder very like the soil or white sand\nfrom which they were produced. Yet when they were again dissolved in\nthe same water they again formed crystals, and again and again shortly\nafterwards turned into white sand. This happens individually only to\ncrystals of this kind, as far as I have been able to observe.\nII. Petrifying Springs which turn to stone. The most famous petrifying\nspring is near the town of Knaresborough, also in Yorkshire.55 The\ncrystals are of exactly the same kind as those we described above when\ndealing with calcarious salt.\n54\nAn extended discussion of this phenomena by Lister is discussed in his Philosophical Transactions article: \u201cCertain Observations of the Midland Salt-Springs of\nWorcester-Shire, Stafford-Shire and Cheshire. Of the Crude Salt, Which Grows from\nthe Stone-Powder Dejected by the Said Brines in Boyling. Of the Speci\u0003ck Difference\nbetwixt Sea Salt and Common Salt. A Way (Which Seems to be the True Method of\nNature) of Distilling Sweet and Fresh Water from Sea Water, by the Breath of Sea\nPlants Growing in It. That This Breath Probably is the Material Cause of the Trade\nor Tropick Winds. In a Letter to the Publisher from the Learned Martin Lister Dr. of\nPhysick of the University of Oxon,\u201d 14, 156 (1684), pp. 489\u2013495.\n55\nKnaresborough Spa was a rival to Harrogate, and both spas were in the same\nregion.\n\nPages 251:\n234\nappendix\nPage 38\nYet if the water of this spring is boiled dry by a violent heat thin layers of whitish limestone are produced in abundance. By chance this\nphenomenon became known to me in another way; I kept in my house\nsome glass jars of this spring-water from the month of August right\nup to the mid-winter. I saw no change in them until the glass vessels\nhad been broken by a hard ice. But then I noticed a very white stony\ndust in plentiful quantities had been deposited. This was a snowy white\npowder, more attractive than one could belief, and bereft of any salt.\nThat is because the powder, which is deposited without any external\nagent, is the same as the layers formed by boiling the water dry.\nFrom about sixty pounds of the water of this spring I obtained about\ntwo and a half ounces of powdered limestone, and about a drachm of\nsalt, so they were in a proportion of one to twenty.\nI then performed the experiment afresh with about 120 pounds of\nwater.\nPage 39\nI obtained about \u0003ve ounces of limestone, but at least two drachms\nof salt.\nI tried each again in mid-summer. I drew the former water from the\nspring itself, but took the latter water as it fell from the rock. We were\nable to discern no difference whatever in either, and I obtained a small\namount of salt in proportion to the lime. Some British writers loudly\ndeclare that this is not so, no doubt so that they can lend credibility to\nthe \u2018Corrosion of Helmontius.\u201956 But he is wrong.\nYet my good friend Frencius57 was right when he remarked that from\nthis water, when it is boiled dry, only some stony powder remains, and\n56\nHere Lister argues against the Helmontian belief analyzed in Helmont\u2019s Oriatrick,\nor Physick Re\u0003ned that vitriol and its acid, the \u201chungry\u201d \u201ccorrosive\u201d or \u201chermaphroditical\nsalt\u201d was the seminal consituent of mineral waters and metal ores. See chapter three\nfor an extended discussion of this issue.\n57\nFrencius is apparently the chymist John French, who wrote extensively on spa\nwaters in Knaresborough. See John French, The Yorkshire Spaw, or a treatise of four famous\nmedicinal wells . . . near Knaresbrough in Yorkshire, etc., (London: E. Dod and N. Ekins, 1652).\nFrench also was engaged in preparing arti\u0003cial mineral waters to mimic natural ones\nat Tunbridge and Epsom. See John French, The art of distillation; or a treatise of the choicest spagyricall preparations performed by way of distillation . . . etc. (London: E. Cotes, 1651).\nSee also Noel G. Coley, \u201cCures Without Care,\u201d pp. 191\u2013214 for a discussion of these\narti\u0003cial spa waters.\n\nPages 252:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n235\nomitted to mention any salt, for in a moderate quantity of water there\nappeared to be none.\nWhen milk is boiled it also coagulates, no doubt because of the\npresence of a little salt of nitre of lime. This too is heavier than common water.\nPage 40\n\u00a7 There is a certain spring of the same nature, and not so obscure, by\nthe banks of the river Ouse near Clifton, one milestone from York.\nBut its water does not become inky-black when galls are added. It does\nhowever produce salt of lime and likewise white powdered limestone.\n\u00a7 I experienced the same phenomenon in some well-water from my\nhouse, when I lived in the central street of York which is called Stonegate. When it was boiled slender slivers of limestone \u0002oated on top,\nand produced the same crystals on the \u0003nal evaporation.\n\u00a7 But, note well, there are some wells within this city which produce\ngenuine, combustible saltpetre along with the rest, but it is simply an\naccidental property, and is by no means a natural characteristic of\nwater, when saltpetre is produced from animal excrement.\nPage 41\nIII. Cold inky-black springs, which contain only one of these two salts, that is,\nsalt of lime. The mineral spring at Scarborough, which is inky-black\nand cold, contains only one salt, and that in large quantities, namely\ncalcarious salt.\nFurthermore the water of this spring produces both ochre and whitish\nlimestone. According to my good friend Wittius in every six pounds of\nwater from the Scarborough spring you will \u0003nd about three drachms\nof contained substances.58 And in my experiment I obtained about an\nounce and a half of content from sixteen pounds of boiled water.\n\u00a7 The inky-black water in the neighbourhood of Knaresborough\nnear Harrogate, which our fellow-countrymen commonly call \u2018the sweet\nspring\u2019, produces the same salt of lime, but only a few grains in very\nmany pounds of water. In 80 pounds of water 90 grains of content\n58\nAnother reference to Robert Wittie, Scarbrough spaw; or, A description of the nature and\nvertues of the spaw at Scarbrough Also a treatise of the nature and use of water (London: Charles\nTyus and Richard Lambert, 1660).\n\nPages 253:\n236\nappendix\nremained. (According to Frencius) the water is more powerful, owing\nto the spirit of metal ore,\nPage 42\nin the ice of winter, and likewise in summer more so in the morning\nthan at noon.\n\u00a7 In the inky-black spring near Malton in the same county the\nsame salt of lime is found. The same water also produces ochre and\nlimestone in abundance. Yet some British writers boldly assert the\nopposite. Yet they are wrong. Add to these a certain feather-like alumen.59\nIt is of course the same substance as one may from burned sulphur\nand pounded pyrites.\nFrom the results I obtained matters concerning the water of this\nspring were as follows. Ochre is of course the \u0003rst thing to be deposited\nfrom water when it is warmed. Shortly afterwards scales of limestone\nare deposited. But when the water is \u0003nally reduced to a tiny amount,\none may \u0003lter off something resembling a feather-like alumen. This\nis the genuine product of pyrites. Finally however crystals of nitre of\nlime develop.\nPage 43\nIf your progress is retarded by the confused combination of some\nsmall crystals, then rub a little vessel with a small amount of alumen;\nattractive and larger crystals will then form for you to see.\nThe crystals of this spring may be related to these illustrations (which\nwe have placed above in the table by N. 5) if they are counted individually, as I have taught while applying the greatest care.\nMost of them have four \u0002at sides which are long and quadrilateral;\nat one extremity they end in a point made up of two \u0002at quadrilaterals, whilst at the other they end in a sharp edge, also made up two\n\u0002at quadrilaterals but invariably placed the opposite way round to the\nearlier ones. It may be that a \u0003fth \u0002at surface can be seen between\n59\nThe italics were Lister\u2019s, and this is an explicit reference to William Simpson\u2019s\nHydrologica Chymica . . . (London: W.G., 1669), which contained a description of the spas\nat Malton and Knarsborough. On p. 135, Simpson asserted that the Malton Spa was\nthoroughly impregnated with an \u201cessurine alumenish salt\u201d which reacted with the\niron in the water. This was in direct contradiction to Lister\u2019s assertion there was no\nhermaphroditical or essurine salt which promoted chymical reactions in water.\n\nPages 254:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n237\nthem, although it is very narrow, and certainly not armed with a point,\nin fact it generally shrinks away.\nThere are other types, for which that \u0003fth side acts as an intermediate stage although it is by far the widest of all.\nPage 44\nThere is such great diversity regarding their extremities that some of\nthem appear to be different crystals from the ones they really are.\nI now come to those springs, in which both salts are to be found.\nThese are generally hot springs\nInky-black springs in which both salts exist. IV. There are furthermore a\nfew thermal springs, or hot springs, in England. By far the most famous\nare those inky-black ones which arise in the city of Bath in Somerset.\nThe British writers Jordan60 and Guidotius give the following account\nof these waters.\nThe salts of the hot springs of Bath are nitre and common salt\n(although, since this nitre is not combustible I have no doubt that it is\ncalcarious). There is twice as much common salt as nitre, ochre and\nlimestone in the water, but not even the smallest amount of the former\ncan be obtained from boiling, whilst the same process produces twice\nas much of the latter as all the other salts\nPage 45\nIt may be however that Guidotius is being over-clever is trying to distinguish between two types of limestone.\nWe must however listen to him in the case of what follows.\nEverything around the baths, especially the stones near the springs\nthemselves, are colored with the deep yellow of ochre. The writer\ncollected about a pound of this genuine ochre, and adds that it is\nprobable that a good part of it evaporates off when the water boils, as\nis observed in greater detail in its actual vapors.\nWhen the waters of hot springs heat up, they grow inky-black.\nLikewise these waters grow very hot, and continually produce steam.\n60\nEdward Jorden, A discourse of natural bathes and mineral waters wherein the origin of\nfountain in general is declared (London: George Sawbridge, 1631); Thomas Guildott, A\ncentury of observations, containing further discoveries of the nature of the hot waters at Bath (London: Henry Brome, 1676).\n\nPages 255:\n238\nappendix\nTheir heat is consistent in both summer and winter, and so these hot\nsprings must \u0002ow from deep down amid black loam.\nThe hot springs have a deeper color when it is freezing cold than can\nbe produced with galls when the sky is clear. Likewise if the waters are\nkept for long during a freezing cold period they retain their astringent\nqualities\nPage 46\nBut when the sky is clear they quickly lose this. If the same waters are\nkept in well-sealed vessels they dye them with galls after a few days.\nWhen the sandy deposit of these springs is lighted, it emits a \u0002ame\nin the dark like that of sulphur. The same should be assumed of the\nmuddy residue. The same result has been obtained from the residue\nleft by the waters after they have been boiled away.\nThe warm waters of Derbyshire, named after Buxton Wells.61 \u00a7 There are\nother hot springs in England to be found in Derbyshire. Of these I have\npersonally visited those commonly called Buxton Wells, and the waters\nare indeed warm. The spring itself is remarkable and \u0002ows with a large\nvolume of water. The spring itself is enclosed in an vault of adequate\nsize to render bathing more convenient, just as is the custom in those\nhottest regions which I have observed (I am speaking of Aix in Provence\nand other places abroad which I witnessed with my own eyes),\nPage 47\nbut certainly not in the open air, as is done elsewhere in England at\nthe risk of one\u2019s health. As one enters the vaulted area one feels the\nvery warm air, and if a window on the opposite side of the building\nwere not continually, or at least by day, kept open, then some would\nnot easily be able to tolerate the warmth of the place; where there is\nan opening in the wall to permit the water to \u0002ow out one can see the\nsteam, just like smoke, hovering over the surface of the water, even in\nthe days around the summer solstice. It is however true that nobody\n\u0003nds the water very warm when they \u0003rst immerse themselves; but\nafter a few moments you would be amazed that you did not perceive\n61\nBuxton Wells in Derbyshire has springs present where the local limestone rock\nmeets the grit stone, and the water is forced up and along \u0003ssures until it arrives at the\nsurface. Its thermal springs were known to the Romans, and it also possessed a Royal\nCrescent modelled on that of Bath.\n\nPages 256:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n239\nthe warmth previously, such is the pleasant warmth with which it \u0002ows\nround all your limbs. Likewise if you cast a bare foot over the bubbling\nwater (as happens in several places in the bath) you will clearly feel\nthe warmth. But it steams copiously for most of the year, especially\nin the winter.\nPage 48\nBesides this, the several springs surrounding the monument are also\nwarm, as are those erupting nearby; one of these is called St. Anne\u2019s\nWell, which if is drunk causes vomiting, depending how much is\nimbibed.62\nBut here inky-black fountains gush from broken stone63 under which\nthere are iron fossils; And indeed in the mountains even more distant\nthan a mile, some springs even now are dug out for use; But out of\nthese small neighbouring streams with their sloping banks you will\nagree consist of clear liquids.\nThese Fountains are most clear and drop hardly any clay, and are\nnot with the summer heat inky-black, and yet some people clearly taste\nsome metallic iron in the water.\nBut boiling 32 pounds of the fountains towards dryness, I have not\nfound a single scruple of salt, without the presence of the limestone.\nFor the most part, the salt of the springs, bound up with common salt,\nwas interposed between limestone crystals.\nPage 49\nChapter 5\nConcerning the origin of the substances contained in the medicinal springs of\nEngland.\nUp to this point we have discussed the salts of the individual medicinal springs, which are only two, namely nitre of lime [nitrum calcarium]\nand common salt: likewise we have discussed their native earth, namely\nochre, and equally limestone. In addition we shall now brie\u0002y discuss\nthe origin of all of these, or,\n62\n63\nTo this day, visitors to Buxton \u0003ll their bottles at St. Anne\u2019s Well.\nAgain, a reference to the springs arising from \u0003ssures in the limestone.\n\nPages 257:\n240\nappendix\nPage 50\nif you will, the means by which they are created.\nI shall begin however with sea, or common, salt, since its creation is\nthe simplest, and seems to be nothing other than mere melting, since\npure salt itself is a puri\u0003ed subterranean substance.\nAnd indeed in our native springs it is found for the most part without\nany, or with only a very little, residual earth.\nBut where there is nitre of lime, there is always limestone to be\nfound. And it is indeed corrosive that nitre of lime develops from its\nown type of stone. The way in which this development occurs must\nnow be explained.\nWe have explained above how salts, when dug-up, grows into crystals.\nBut there exists a second way in which these develop. If the former\noccurs in an instant, the latter occurs slowly and in stages, on the analogy of the method by which plants germinate.\nPage 51\nAlthough nitre of lime is produced in one and the same way as vitriol,\neven if this substance is nowhere to be found in a complete and perfect state in our medicinal springs, yet, because ochre is the breeding\nground, as it were, of this salt, (and we must enquire into this also in\nthis chapter), it will not be irrelevant to explain the origin of each at\none and the same time.64\nThe creation of vitriol makes the whole matter clear. Its \u0003rst eruption from pyrites is exceedingly premature, if it occurs in contact with\nair; but, as time proceeds, it becomes a little more mature. And yet\nfully-formed vitriol is not produced from any ferrous stone until after\nits due maturity which it \u0003nally reaches after a continuous period of\ndevelopment.\nNewly produced vitriol, I declare, is a kind of alum, that is, it is\nproduced from pyrites like strands of hair.65 When these strands are\ncreated, they are a whitish color, but when they are fully-formed the\nare green. Then these same strands\n64\nThis is nother example of the mechanism of witterung. See chapter three for more\nanalysis of Lister\u2019s belief in the germination of salts via the air.\n65\nLiterally, trichites\u2014this word derives from a Greek word meaning \u201chair.\u201d\n\nPages 258:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n241\nPage 52\nbecome thick and strong instead of being thin and weak. It is easy to\ntest this phenomenon by an experiment in the following manner, and\nindeed to make it occur.\nLet drops of spring water fall by design onto clods of ferrous pyrites.\nIf the experiment is performed with care and attention, and without\nallowing the water to turn inky black with galls, (which we must investigate next), it will produce a whitish salt which grows into crystals of\na cubic-rhomboid shape. See \u0003gure 6.\nThese crystals are formed at the \u0003rst solidi\u0003cation. For if they are\ntaken away and further drying takes place, it will produce salt of another\nkind, if any at all is to be had, one which is, of course, peculiar to its\nown spring; this must be carefully observed.\nYet if you were to allow the same water to drip onto the pyrites until\nit becomes inky black with galls, then it will reveal to you immature\nsalt, which will next solidify into many-sided crystals,\nPage 53\nafter the fashion of alum, and of a greenish hue.\nBut if you were to allow the same drops to be perfectly formed in\nrespect of color and consistency, (I have not yet investigated how many\nhours and days are required to accomplish this maturity) you will eventually obtain crystals of mature vitriol as described above.\nSo far we have discussed only the sprinkling of pyrites in air. If\nhowever it is kept perpetually under water I am not yet convinced that\nit will be productive of any salt. Certainly no vitriol whatever will be\ngenerated. Meanwhile certain gases, or, if you will, a subtle, sulphurous\nand in\u0002ammable vapour is produced and is continually resolved into\nits native ochre or metallic iron [metallum]. These are of course the\nresults of, as it were, a miscarriage in the attempt to activate or generate vitriol, or, if you will, unsuccessful attempts made under water. But\nI shall have more to say about this below.\nIn the second already mentioned process ochre is created,\nPage 54\nand furthermore it should be understood that it too is being particularly\nproduced in the dissolution of the pyrites under the water.\nAdd to this that before the actual activation of the vitriol it cannot\nbe elicited even by a violent chemical process [literally: \u2018by chemical\n\nPages 259:\n242\nappendix\ntorture\u2019]. As Borrichius says in the Doc. Met. page 44, \u2018If one were to\nfollow up the \u0003rst burning of the pyrites by immediately applying heat,\none would collect very little, if one may believe the words of those who\nwere in charge of this skill.\u201966 One must of course wait for it to grow,\nand this proceeds slowly.\nThe same phenomenon is con\u0003rmed again and again: for no salt\nwhatever grows from limestone immediately after it has been softened\n[or \u2018slaked\u2019] by the application of heat, but the same stone produces\nan abundance of salt, whether it [i.e. the stone] has been untreated or\nheated, whilst forming the walls or roof of some house;67 it then grows\ntogether to form crystals of its own kind as described above.\nThe same phenomenon should be supposed in the case of nitre of\nlime, which in like manner produces\nPage 55\na snowy white powder, or, if you will, limestone, and vitriol, and ochre,\nfor each reason suggested above.\nYet (so as not to omit what others have observed) fully formed vitriol,\ncleansed of its ochre, becomes whitish, and the lime of this white salt,\nor, if you will, the caput mortuum formed from the calcinated salt, does\nnot grow red, but becomes whitish, light, and porous, as that most\nillustrious author our friend Coxius declares. (See Phil. Transactions\nof Oldenberg, number 130).68\n66\nOlaus Borrichius, Docimastice metallica (Hafniae, 1667). This was translated into\nmany languages and described the methods of analyzing the most important metals.\nBorrichius (1626\u201390) was a Danish alchemist who extracted oxygen out of nitre. Again\nLister is trying to deny that vitriol can be produced by heat, or in water in his attempt\nto show its production was primarily via exposure to air.\n67\nAgain Lister is describing the production of nitre on walls that were limed and\nproximate to animal excreta.\n68\nDaniel Coxe, \u201cSome Observations and Experiments about Vitriol, Tending to\nFind Out the Nature of That Substance, and to Give Further Light in the Inquiry\nafter the Principles and Properties of Other Minerals: Communicated by a Fellow of\nthe R.

Coxe noted that vitriolate Water from the Deptford\nWells when distilled and evaporated repeatedly also led to a \u0003ery white salt. Most likely\nwhat happened is that ferrous sulphate, the Hungarian vitriol (FeSO4 \u0004 7H2O) when\n\nPages 260:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n243\nYet I reply that chalk, (ibid. Number 142)69 or limestone formed from\npyrites, is used to provide an underground foundation for paving, in\nthose places indeed where vitriol is produced in the open. Therefore one\nmust justi\u0003ably ask whether it is the product of some lime salt rather\nthan the dead head of pyrites. Then again pyrites is usually mixed with\ncertain other stones in tiny quantities, and I have carefully kept.\nPage 56\nvery many types of these mixtures at my house. Again pure unadulterated pyrites is a form of iron found underground [metallum], as I\nhave suggested above, and when burnt in its entirety it grows red like\ncalcinated ochre and is attracted by a magnet. Furthermore by itself\nit does not produce limestone. The qualities of that whitish salt are\nshortly to be examined to see whether or not they can be related to\nimmature vitriol, or to true alum, or to common salt etc.\nPage 57\nChapter 6\nThe generation of vitriol, as explained by Helmontius, is refuted, and likewise that\nother explanation of the Parisian philosophers. Likewise we refute the notion that\nvitriol may be produced arti\u0003cially by any process.\nI am unhappy with Helmontius\u2019 explanation of the generation of\nvitriol. He would have it that salt is formed naturally in water itself,\nthis salt being variously known as \u2018juice,\u2019 \u2018a certain universal spirit,\u2019 \u2018the\nembryonate,\u2019 \u2018the corrosive,\u2019 \u2018the hermaphroditic\u2019 (for it is by these and\nother names that he calls it).70\ndessicated loses its color and becomes a white crumbly salt. According to The Merck\nIndex (1983), heating FeSO4 \u0004 7H2O to 90\u00b0C will leave ferrous sulphate monohydrate.\nThe monohydrate will give up its last H2O by heating to 300\u00b0C, which was likely in\nthe range of early modern distillation equipment with constant \u0003re.\n69\nLister refers here to Daniel Colwall, \u201cAn Account of the Way of Making English Green-Copperas, Communicated by the Same\u201d Philosophical Transactions 12, 142\n(1677/8), pp. 1056\u20131059. Colwall on p. 1057 described how the beds of Deptford to\nmake Copperas were lined with \u201cthe rubbish of chalk.\u201d\n70\nLister wished to not only to prove the ef\u0003cacy of air or exhalations as the source\nof chemical reactions and effects but argued against the Helmontian belief that vitriol\nand its acid, the \u201chungry\u201d or \u201chermaphroditical salt\u201d was the \u201cseminal consituent\nof mineral waters and metal ores.\u201d For a discussion of this belief about vitriol, see\nEmerton, The Scienti\u0003c Reinterpretation of Form, p. 218.\n\nPages 261:\n244\nappendix\nNotes in left margin of page: The seed of corrosive salt is up to this point\nstill free from any \u0002avours Parad.3\u2014It is the \u0003rst essence of corrosive things: same\npassage.

It is pointless to state that corrosive salt exists anywhere (since up to\nthis point it has no characteristics, and is not even recognizable).\n2. It is clear from the arguments stated above that pyrites can by no\nmeans produce its own vitriol from its own waters.\n3. It is scarcely credible that a vein of iron can be eaten away by that\ncorrosive salt of its own, since we have proved by experiment that\nnot even haematite, that very soft substance which closely resembles\nmud, or ochre, can be corroded even to the least extent by even the\nstrongest of the aforesaid solutions (such as the pure aqua fortis, or\nspirit of nitre, which I have mentioned).\nPage 59\nPerhaps the man is deceived by the fact that iron itself is very easily\ncorroded by certain acids. Yet this is not at all true of any iron dug\nfrom the ground [metallum] that I have seen in England up to the present (and I have a collection of very many of these from most parts of\nEngland in my house). Indeed not even that excellent Suecicum, which\nis as good a friend of the magnet as anything else, is corroded by the\naforesaid solutions insofar as it is a form of iron dug from the ground\n[metallum]. I can vouch for this by personal experience.\n4. I call upon the experiments described above to prove that vitriol is\nproduced by a continual and slow process of germination, and is\nnot therefore produced in a moment by any corrosion.\n71\nThese notes are references to Johann van Helmont\u2019s Ternary of Paradoxes (Parad).\nSee Johann van Helmont, Van Helmont\u2019s Works (London: Lodowick Lloyd, 1664), pp.\n693\u2013698 for van Helmont\u2019s comments on vitriol.\n\nPages 262:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n245\nIt is indeed most true that genuine mature vitriol may be elicited\nin a few moments from hardened iron [\u2018chalybs\u2019 usually represents\n\u2018steel\u2019] with plain water (and free from foreign droplets and all acid, a\nfact to which that most elegant writer Bataevus Pecklinus (Purg. Exer.)\nbears witness).72\nPage 60\nI should like you to consider that the substance of iron is dense and\nweighty, but in its subterranean form [metallum] rather porous. This is\nproved by the fact that in its cast form it resembles pumice and would\nbe highly fragile, if it were not subsequently hardened by violent blows.\nFurthermore the hardened iron itself becomes one of the remaining\nmixed metals, (I speak with the alchemists here). That is (see Agr. On\nMetals73) when iron is hardened and belaboured with blows it is again\ninfused with the fused metal and imbued with it to the greatest extent\npossible; of course, as a result of an extended period of heating it\nabsorbs into itself a great quantity of fused metal. It must be considered that vitriol is produced in it in the same way as it is produced\nin pyrites, even if its production is accomplished in a hidden manner\nwithin the iron itself.\nIndeed it appears that plain water can be elicited from from hardened\niron, which is the only substance it contains within it, and that no vitriol\nwhatever arises instantaneously. This can be proved as follows:\nPage 61\niron \u0003lings grow warm when water is poured on them (see Pecklin. de\nP. Med. Facul. page 13; likewise Letter 11 of F. Joseph Burlius to Barsbol.\nPhil.

Add to this\nthat trichites75 vitriol is formed from untreated pyrites, but that when it\nis heated vitriol is produced, but in another way which is by no means\nclear, since the active state which will come from the heat seems, if\nnot to be partially destroyed, at least to be changed in some way. We\nthink the same about iron. Again it is known that the metallic form\n[metallum] of alum can be heated to a very high temperature (I have\nno doubt that the same is true of pyrites). Finally, even if vitriol were\nnot produced unless it germinated for some time, as we have shown\nabove, still some hours or days would be required for it to mature, so\nthat I fail to understand how I could deny that, in some experiment\nor other,\nPage 62\ninsuf\u0003cient time has been allowed for the production of perfect\nvitriol.\n5. Ochre is the subterranean form [metallum] of iron and so contains\nwithin it at least the beginnings of vitriol: however thoroughly and\ncarefully you wash ochre, until it no longer produces water inky\nblack with galls, yet gradually, if you place it in some moist place,\nit will produce vitriol anew from that place, just as though from the\ngreater pyrites.\n6. The chemical liquids [liquores chymici] do not separate from the\nmetals which they have eaten away voluntarily, but all the inky black\nacidic substances reject their ochre at once.\nFurthermore these same chemical liquids are able to recommence eating away the metals which they have rejected when heat is applied. We\nhave however witnessed the opposite in the case of acidic substances\nof this kind; that is, they never again reabsorb\nBirrhi reports pouring a pint of water on 10 pounds of \u0003lings of Iron, which \u201cwithin\nthe space of an hours and a half, ferment and grow hot.\u201d\n75\nLister\u2019s word for immature \u201chair-like\u201d vitriol growing on pyrites.

But wherever gas, or vapour, of this kind\nis acidic, then, if it arises from pyrites it is truly vitriolic; if from the\nmetal of alum, aluminous; if from limestone, nitrous in its own way.\nWhy, I declare that there exists a subtle gas proper to all those salts as\nthey develop or grow active, and that it truly shares in the nature and\nproperties of each of those substances from which it emanates.\n\u00a7 There are however some (Phil. Transact. Number 104) who assert\nthat vitriol can be made from actual common salt.76 That indeed may\nbe partially true, that is,\nPage 64\nto the extent to which that salt shares in the qualities of vitriol. By\nchance it is not so different from vitriol in its green color and what\none might call its sourness. But it is credible that this common salt is\nnot turned into true vitriol, but has borrowed from vitriol a certain\nghost-like similarity.\nIf however it be urged that when salts of several kinds are dissolved\nsimultaneously in the same water and dried out by heat they each\nsolidify separately with their own shapes and colors, then we admit, \u2018It\nis so\u2019. But if some salt has eaten away iron or copper, ( just consider,\ncommon salt, thinned into gas by the force of \u0003re, or otherwise) then\nindeed we think that it may to some extent have adopted a different\nquality by contamination.\nBut perchance I am quarrelling pointlessly.

That is to say, it becomes spirit in its whole nature. As a result\nwe are no longer surprised that so insubstantial a juice (which is the\nvery essence of pyrites) is less capable of developing into crystals.\nMany phenomena show that pyrites is in its whole substance dissolved\nin inky-black waters and turns to steam:\n1. In the British hot springs (as has been suggested above) whatever is\nexposed to their steamy vapour is strongly colored with ochre.\nPage 67\nII. Likewise it is well-known in the case of both cold and warm inkyblack springs that, when they are collected in bags which are carefully\n77\nPlease see chapter three for a discussion concerning the controversy of the formation of vitriol in water.\n78\nAnother reference to the survey organized by Du Clos.\n79\nThe nature of this quarrel is evident in the Philosophical Transactions.\n80\nJohann van Helmont, Supplementum de spadanis fontibus (Liege, 1624). Helmont also\nmentions in the Ternary of Paradoxes that \u201cthe Danubius, the Rherne, the River Rhoan,\nSaw, Po, etc.\u201d do obtain such a [vitriolic] fountain in their \u0003rst spring.\u201d See Johann\nVan Helmont, Van Helmont\u2019s Works (London: Lodowick Lloyd, 1664), p. 694.\n\nPages 266:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n249\nstopped up, they preserve for a long time the property they share with\ngall-nuts of dying, but that when they are kept in open vessels they\nlose the ability to dye much more quickly; this of course is due to the\nochre which is not so much removed and rendered weak and clearly\nineffective as a result of the movement.\nThe same account is true of plants. I once gave a clear example of\nthis in respect of the Bermudan cedar wood (Philosophical Transactions\nNumber 110); I have kept it by me for many years and it has not yet\nceased to exude the vapour of its resin from its whole substance.81\nIII. Ochre itself vaporizes, as has been suggested above, because it\nis particularly at odds with a stony nature, for chemical reasons, since\nit has a dense and heavy substance.\nIt is utterly pointless to wait for some spirit to drip out of it, which\nis of course the task of some kind of fermentation.\nPage 68\nBut this spirit of ours, which \u0002ies off, is none other than the animating\nmetallic ore.\nIV. The taste and smell of waters of this kind is totally lost once\nthe \u0003rst distillation has begun, before the separation of the said spirit,\nwhatever it is, even if the greatest care is taken, and at the same the\nability to dye in conjunction gall-nuts is also lost.\nV. Indeed the very property of dying \u0003nally expires spontaneously\neven if the water be kept in very carefully stopped-up vessels, not by\nreason of the loss of some vapour, but because its quickening motion\nbecomes weak, and then clearly quiescent and dead.\nVI. The separation of ochre and limestone indicates that these substances were in the liquid. For they could not be prevented for a moment\nfrom sinking down from their salts, which are either not present at all, or\npresent in very small quantities, as has been suggested above. And yet,\ncontrary to the nature of dense and heavy bodies, (as they indeed are),\nochre itself does so slowly, especially if the water is carefully kept in\n81\nMartin Lister, \u201cSome Observations and Experiments Made, and in a Letter\nCommunicated to the Publisher, for the R. Society, by the Learned and Inquisitive\nMr. Martin Lister,\u201d Philosophical Transactions 9 (1674), pp. 221\u2013226. This is a reference\nto Lister\u2019s belief that vaporous exhalations from materials had the power to create or\nchange matter, a re\u0002ection of the concept of witterung in German mining manuals. See\nchapter three for a discussion of witterung. In his article in the Philosophical Transactions,\nLister gives several examples of matter seemingly generated out of the air, such as the\nformation of vitriol on pyrites.\n\nPages 267:\n250\nappendix\nclosed vessels or if it is left alone without the application of any heat.\nLimestone is separated out with dif\u0003culty only after some time, and\nonly after a long and severe period of freezing cold.\nVII. Very little salt is found in springs in which ochre and limestone\nare very abundant. In inky-black waters where there is an abundance of\nochre there is no vitriol whatever. Likewise in petrifying waters (which\nare well-known in England) near Knaresborough, the salt is like a stony\npowder in a proportion of about 1 to 20. On the other hand in mature\nvitriol and nitre of lime ochre and limestone are to be found in tiny\nproportions compared with the saline elements. Seven ounces of nitre\nof lime can at once be reduced by burning to two ounces, The same\nshould be assumed in the case of vitriol left in the caput mortuum.\nVIII. It is generally agreed that pyrites is to be found in inky-black\nwaters entirely under the appearance of liquid from the following experiment: take some freshly drawn inky-black water, from a place where\nthere is a great deal of ochre, say Malton, and add drop by drop a tiny\namount of that lye which soap manufacturers make from quicklime\nand so-called clavellated ashes;82 what sinks down gleams with a golden\nsheen, so that you may believe that pyrites itself is being separated.\nIX. Pyrites behaves in one way in air, which we discussed above,\nand another when it is kept continually underwater, since vitriol is\nproduced from pyrites in air, but under water pyrites almost dissolves.\nThis is proved by the following fact,\nPage 71\nthat pyrites can be burnt to produce ochre and sulphur and nothing else.\nAnd very little vitriol can be drawn from it by applying \u0003re. Similarly\nochre and sulphurous vapour are always present in inky-black waters.\nIt is by no means vitriol, at least of the mature kind.\nBut vitriol itself (the other way in which it is produced is described\nabove) is resolved into three basic substances. One of these is saline,\nthe second sulphur and the third is ochre. But the saline element is\npresent solely owing to the development of pyrites in the air.\nThe more demanding thinkers have some doubt about sulphur in\nvitriol. But what happens in the case of the sulphur of pyrites, which,\n82\nThe OED reveals that clavellated ashes were \u201cashes of burnt lees or dregs of\nwine; Said of potash, probably in reference to its having been obtained from billets\nof wood by burning.\u201d\n\nPages 268:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n251\nas we have stated, can be forced into sulphur for the most part by the\napplication of severe heat. In the end when it is exposed to the air it\nturns entirely into vitriol. Then again, other methods are described\nin the works of certain more recent writers, by which sulphur itself is\ndrawn from oil of vitriol, which I omit in the interests of brevity.\nPage 72\nYet I do not deny that certain springs are comparable in this respect,\nby reason of either their position, which is, as ever, some underground\nchannel, or by reason of the inky-black essence, on account of some\nvery obscure increase in the water, so that at least from time to time they\ndisplay vitriol in one mature form or another (which we have shown\nabove is threefold). And so if anyone wishes carefully to investigate\nthis matter, to see whether and how vitriol is produced in inky-black\nsprings, then, indeed, he must needs apply much diligence over a long\nperiod, and must frequently examine the waters on every noteworthy\nchange in the weather.\nYet some may object that vitriol combines with salt of lime. This is a\nmere suspicion, in my opinion. Yet if some raw vitriol is present though\nconcealed (for this cannot true of mature vitriol, since the color and\nappearance where it is concealed is easily discerned).\nPage 73\nThat man will be successful who is able to dissolve this bond with the\nfollowing results, so that both salts show themselves voluntarily and\ncome into sight.\nIt is then not credible that calcarious salt contains vitriol concealed\nwithin it rather than common salt, where however the smell of pyrites\nis strong; this is the case in certain salt springs where however there is\nnot even a hint of vitriol. But others who have the time must investigate\nthese phenomena. I personally af\u0003rm nothing.\nPage 74\nChapter VIII\nAn explanation of the petrifying action of certain springs.\nIn brief, my understanding of petri\u0003cation is as follows. Pyrites and\nlimestone (for as far as my own observations are concerned no other\nsubstances in Britain turn to stone), as I have stated just now in the last\nchapter, dissolve, as it were, entirely in springs of this kind because of\n\nPages 269:\n252\nappendix\nan exceedingly subtle current of air. And so they easily penetrate even\nthe densest wood, and wooden pyrites have for the most part stony\ninsides.83 This is scarcely conceivable in the case of some calcarious\npowder or ochre, however \u0003ne it be.\nThen from these wooden pyrites vitriol is produced from the air.\nAnd so they consist entirely of pyrites.\nPage 75\nPyrites changes iron which has a true admixture of copper, or, if you\nwill, a vein of copper, into bronze in a similar way (to make an incidental observation), that is, by the very method of petri\u0003cation already\nexplained in the case of two other liquids. But in the latter case the\niron is no more changed into bronze than in the former case wood is\nchanged into iron. Nor is there need of any solution. But the copperimpregnated liquid enters deeply with its whole substance and combines\npeacefully by embracing the iron.\nThere are many factors against some sort of precipitation, or the\nseparation of salt, as the mechanism for petri\u0003cation.\n1. Springs of this kind do not usually become cloudy or muddy.\n2. Ochre and limestone are deposited spontaneously (as has been\nexplained above) but without any solidi\u0003cation, &amp;c.\nPage 76\nChapter 9\nThe cause of hot springs is derived from salts produced by pyrites and limestone or\nactivated by pyrites itself and limestone; other opinions are refuted.\nIt has been shown above that our hot waters of Bath are of a dark\nhue, and contain within them salts of two kinds, that is common salt\nand sodium carbonate and that likewise they exhibit Ocra and limestone.\nBut there is much doubt as to how they grow hot.\nMy own opinion however is that our native hot springs borrow their\nheat from active pyrites and limestone.\nI exclude common salt, which practically seems to be produced by\nmere melting.\n83\nAgain Lister is claiming that witterung or vaporous exhalations from minerals\npromote material change, in this case petri\u0003cation.\n\nPages 270:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n253\nPage 77\nFurthermore from both substances in their active state a warm\nvapour arises: in the case of pyrites this is largely sulphurous, pungent\nand in\u0002ammable; in the case of limestone however it is milder and\nlighter: I shall prove this in what follows. I shall however begin with\npyrites.\nWhen rocks are opened up in wells or mines, a thin gas usually\narises, which, like sulphur, can very easily be set on \u0003re and is highly\ndangerous to miners.\nIn the second place this gas is especially dangerous in older mineshafts, because in these a long time has elapsed for generating a sulphurous vapour.\nLikewise miners universally agree that for the whole of the winter\nand especially at a time of frost underground tunnels are very warm.\nFurthermore it has been proved above that pyrites produces very\nlarge quantities of sulphur, and I further af\u0003rm that in no mine whatever in England\nPage 78\nis sulphur to be found unless pyrites is present to the same extent,\nor a mixture or compound containing pyrites, but not lead, coal\nor the metallic form of alum, and I af\u0003rm the same fact in respect\nof all other mined substances whatever. I would not wish anyone\nto think that I make these claims in a foolhardy or rash manner,\nfor I drew these conclusions after a long time and much practical\nexperience.\nFurthermore in order to know why and to what extent some mined\nsubstance contains pyrites, employ a magnet, after \u0003rst duly pulverizing and burning the substance, and you will never be deceived by\nthe experiment.\nRocky material poured out from the eruptions of Etna is for the\nmost part ferrous, as the magnet demonstrates; but when the same\nsubstance is ground to a dust and burned again it furnishes abundant\nproof of this phenomenon, if the magnet is moved close once more.\nIt is credible that the type of iron is none other than pyrites from the\nease with which it can be burned.\nFurthermore thunder and lightning are the effects of gas of pyrites,\nif it is set on \u0003re in the sky,\n\nPages 271:\n254\nappendix\nPage 79\nas also are earthquakes*, if by chance the \u0003re is contained in subterranean hollows, and hot springs, if it is transported in abundance along\nwater channels, even if it is not set on \u0003re.84\n*Pliny says that thunder and lightning burn with sulphur, and the actual\nlight they produce is sulphurous. Pliny, Bk 35, ch. 1585\n2. I can prove that a warm gas is produced in like manner from active\nlimestone in the following way.\nAlmost all springs and wells (for most of them are considered medicinal to the extent to which they contain this or that salt) are especially\nwarm at times of fairly severe frost, and are particularly noticeable for\nthe way in which they give off an exhalation consisting of a very dense\nmoist vapour, just like hot springs.\nConcerning the truth of this experience there are of course several\nwells of water in the city of Rome which have beyond doubt proved\nto be warm at a time of frost.

Because when taken into the mouth they do not burn it as much\nas ordinary water which has been heated over a stove to the same\ndegree of heat. This seems to be due to the thinness of the substance by which hot springs are heated; just as the \u0002ame produced\nby brandy does not burn the hand as much as a burning coal placed\non it.\n2. From the manner of heating: for there are certain leaves which\nremain stiff and change only their color when placed in the hottest\nsprings of France\n87\nLister\u2019s connection of volatile salts from pyrites and limestone with the heating of\nmineral waters was in\u0002uenced by the Du Clos\u2019 Observations. In speculating about the\neffects of spa waters, Du Clos had written that \u201cit may be that some Mineral Vapours\nor Exhalations do mix with common Waters . . . and that these Waters are impregnated\nwith their Qualities, and of some other Volatile Salts not Concrete, elevated in these\ndry Exhalations of humid Vapours.\u201d Du Clos also argued that hot springs grew warm\nspeci\u0003cally from hot moist vapours volatilizing from substances like pyritic vitriol, and\nnot from the substances being combusted themselves.\n\nPages 273:\n256\nappendix\nPage 82\nalthough they become soft from a gentle heating in boiling water: from\nthis they argue that the heat of the hot springs is a drying agent rather\nthan a moistener.\n3. Because the hot springs are hotter at night than by day; no doubt\nbecause the warm vapours are very widely spread by the night air.\n4. Because when the water of the hot springs is exposed to the air it\nretains its heat longer than ordinary water heated over a \u0003re, because\ncold air causes the motion stirred up by the \u0003re to cease suddenly.\nBut this same cold air prevents the warm vapours of the hot baths\nfrom being spread so quickly.\n5. Because the water of the hot springs, when placed on a \u0003re, requires\nthe same time to boil as ordinary cold water: from this it is clear that\nthe hot springs were not heated by some underground \u0003re. This at\nleast is what they argue.\nPage 83\nIn order to prove that the activation of pyrites and limestone involves\nvapour: I shall add to these arguments that in wet, moist and chilly\nplaces the activation of those salts is particularly promoted.\nAgain violent rain usually results from thunder; which one could\nscarcely believe would happen if the vapour of pyrites were given off\nof its own accord and in a dry condition.\nYet when it is mixed in tiny amounts with some moist vapour, then if\nat any time and for any reason it happens to be set on \u0003re little droplets\nof water are necessarily forced together and thrown down, when the\ndraught by whose movement and stirring alone they are borne up into\nthe atmosphere is driven away.\nUp to this point I have unfolded my own opinion. Now I turn to a\nrefutation of the opinions of others about springs.\n1. Some indeed believe that the heat of hot springs arises from the\nease with which certain underground substances (such as pyrites)\nare set on\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 250 to page 273 out of a total of 312.

The text details various experiments conducted on these mineral waters, including their chemical composition, especially the formation of salts, limestone, and ochre. The discussion references how salts and minerals like <strong>sodium sulfate</strong> were crystallized through heating or interaction with specific vessels, along with the medical uses of the waters.

- <strong>Petrifying Springs</strong>: Noted for their ability to turn objects into stone, these springs deposit minerals like <strong>calcarious salt</strong>, which interact with surrounding materials, transforming them into solid forms.
- <strong>Inky-black Springs</strong>: Known for their high mineral content, these springs produce ochre and limestone in significant amounts.

You should consider this to be the case\nwith other salts.\nPage 86\nFurthermore in order to prove that this is not a peculiar quality of\nsome water, let water be drawn from this spring, or a well, be it warm\nor hot; and soon it will grow cold of its own accord and freeze, and\nsteam will cease to be produced.\nPage 87\nChapter X\nConcerning the origin and material of rain\nIn the previous chapter we declared that the vapour of pyrites itself\nwas moist, although it is credible that all springs are produced solely by\nrainwater, and this has been proven by my fellow-countryman Wittius\n(On the spring at Scarborough) and others in a learned and prolix manner.91\nI might consider that the production of rainwater, and then pyrites, and\nlimestone might for the most part be derived from this moist vapour.\nHere it will not be irrelevant to my purpose to treat in brief of the\norigin and material of rain.\n1. Waters are exhaled through the action of the sun\u2019s heat, which\nproduces much, but not all, the material for rainwater.\nPage 88\n2. There is in addition the breath of all living things, even insects. This\nis clear to the senses if they are kept under little glass vessels for a\nshort time.\n3. Likewise the breath of plants.

(The Natural History\nof Oxfordshire, D. Plott).92\nThe same phenomenon was described many centuries previously by\nPliny, concerning a grass from Ethiopia, although he placed its effect\namong the illusions of magic. In book 26, chapter 4, he says that\nrivers and lakes are dried up by casting into them Ethiopian grass.93\n92\nAs support, he cited a June 1669 experiment on plant transpiration \u201cin order to\n\u0003nd in what measure Herbs might perspire,\u201d performed by John Wills, a fellow of\nTrinity College, Oxford. Lister speci\u0003cally cited Dr. Robert Plot\u2019s The Natural History\nof Oxfordshire, Being an Essay toward the natural History of England (Oxford: The Theatre,\n1677), pp. 254\u20135. Plot (1640\u201396) of Magdalen College, Oxford, and a Secretary of\nthe Royal Society in 1682, described it as follows: \u201cHe [Wills] took two glass Vials\nwith narrow necks, each holding one pound 8 ounces, and 2 drachms or water . . . into\none of these glasses \u0003lled with water, he put a sprig of \u0002ourishing Mint (which before\nhad grown in the water) weighing one ounce: the other glass he also \u0003ll\u2019d with water,\nand exposed them both in a window to the Sun. After ten days time, he found in the\nbottle where the mint was, only \u0003ve ounces and four drachms of water remaining,\nand no more so that there was one pound two ounces and six drachms spent, the mint\nweighting scarce two drachms more than at \u0003rst. From the other Glass, where water\nwas put of the same weight, and no mint, he found the Sun had exhaled near one\nounce of water, and therefore concluded it drew but so much out of the \u0003rst glass, at\nleast no more: So that allowing one ounce for what the Sun had exhaled, there was\nin those ten days spent by the mint, one pound one ounce six drachms of water; and\nthe mint being increased in weight only two drachms, \u2018twas plain the mint had purely\nexpired in those two days, one pound one ounce and four drachms, that is, each day\nabove an ounce and half, which is more than the weight of the whole mint. Whence\nhe concluded that what Malphigius so wonders at in his Book De Bombyce, viz. that\nthose Animals will sometimes eat in one day, more than the weight of their bodies,\nis out-done by every sprig of mint, and most other Herbs in the Field, which every\nsummers day attract more nourishment than their own weight amounts too. Which\nthe same ingenious person at least questions not (and therefore wishes trials may be\nmade) of the Tithymali, Esulae, and especially of Pinguicula and Ros Solis, which last sucks\nup moisture faster than the Sun can exhale it, and is bedewed all over at Noon-day,\nnotwithstanding its power: Nor doubts he but that Wormwood, and all other Plants\nthat are very hot, and of strong smells, expire as much, if not more than the Mint.\u201d\nAll of the plants (except Wormwood) mentioned by Plot produce liquids that could be\ninterpreted as dew. Ros Solis was Drosera rotundifolia, or Sun-Dew, a carnivorous plant\nnoted for its dew on its leaves that intensi\u0003ed with the sun; Pinguicula was known as\nbutterwort, another carnivorous plant with mucilage drops on its leaves to catch insects,\napparently interpreted by Plot as dew. Tithymali and esulae are species of spurge that\nproduces a milky latex from roots and stems when injured. For descriptions of these\nplants, see John Gerard, Herball or General Historie of Plantes (1613) (New York: Dover\nPublications, 1975).\n93\nI am not familiar with which edition of Pliny that Lister was utilizing, but his\nreferences can be found in a more modern edition. \u201cBut above all things, it was the\nfollies of magic more particularly that contributed so essentially to his success\u2014follies\nwhich had been carried to such a pitch as to destroy all con\u0003dence in the remedial\nvirtues of plants. Thus, for instance, it was stoutly maintained that by the agency of the\nplant aethiopis rivers and standing waters could be dried up\u201d in Pliny the Elder, The\n\nPages 277:\n260\nappendix\nBut to mock the idea he adds below, \u2018So let the Pontine marshes be\ndried up today by Ethiopian grass, and so much land be added to the\nsuburbs of Italy.\u201994 And yet if one reads with care his own description\nof the grass, which he gives a little further on in these words (book\n27, chapter 24)\nPage 89\n\u201cEthiopian* grass has many large leaves, and numerous and full roots,\u201d\nand compares this with the experiment quoted above, he will no longer\nhave any grounds for doubting the veracity of the account in my opinion.\n*Book 27. c. 24 (Pliny\u2019s Natural History)\nIndeed the amount of water which plants growing in springs, rivers\nand lakes consume every day is scarcely credible.\nIn addition the amount used in the same way by woods and grasses\nwhich grow on dry land is amazing. Springs are produced, says the\nsame Pliny, for the most part when woods are cut down; previously\nthe trees fed from them.\nLikewise nocturnal dew for the most part arises when the breath of\nplants is condensed. This happens in Britain by far most copiously in\nMay, when of course the plants are most active and growing most. In\nthe other months it is much less, and in winter there is little dew.\nPage 90\nI have carried out the same experiment several times on seaweed in\nsaltwater; and in this way I have been able to draw freshwater which\nwas drinkable by this novel method of distillation, which will prove\nmost desirable and useful for sailors. I share this knowledge without\njealously guarding it.95\nNatural History. eds. John Bostock, M.D., F.R.S., H.T.

But it may well be that by far the greatest amount of the material\nof rain water arises from the underground salts of mineral ores and\nespecially the active salts of pyrites and limestone and of course by\nthese the waters of springs, rivers and marshes and the sea itself are\ndriven off to form mists. You should take what has been demonstrated above about springs and apply it to all other types of water.\nIn a certain mountainous region, in evening in the valleys, in summer\nand winter, especially when there is a hard frost, certain dense mists\narise continually from the rivers and lakes. At daybreak however the\nsame mists can be spotted climbing about half-way up the mountains.\nBut when the sun has risen or a wind is blowing\nPage 91\nthey are either scattered or, if on the same day they reach the mountain peaks, they continually condense into rain and fall once more into\nthe valleys. As for the reason why this phenomenon can be seen both\non summer evenings and in freezing temperatures in winter, the same\nexplanation applies to both. It occurs because the air is in a very pure\ncondition, and new vapour is taken into it.\nFor the air is thinner than usual in time of frost, because the particles of water are without exception continually turned into frost as\nsoon as they are produced. In like manner in summer, especially in\nthe evening, the mist from rivers, just consider, can be seen. This is\nbecause the air is puri\u0003ed in the daytime by the heat, and the vapour\nis continually seized aloft.\nPage 92\nChapter XI\nAn explanation of springs which stink of sulphur\nThere is hardly any reason for doubting whether the water of some\nspring stinks because of its own nature, or by reason of what it contains. Mineral springs which stink of sulphur contain only one salt, as\nhas been suggested above, and that is the common variety. There is\nbetwixt Sea Salt and Common Salt. A Way (Which Seems to be the True Method of\nNature) of Distilling Sweet and Fresh Water from Sea Water, by the Breath of Sea\nPlants Growing in It. That This Breath Probably is the Material Cause of the Trade\nor Tropick Winds. In a Letter to the Publisher from the Learned Martin Lister Dr.\nof Physick of the University of Oxon,\u201d Philosophical Transactions, 14, 156 (1684), pp.\n489\u2013495.\n\nPages 279:\n262\nappendix\nalso however a vapour or exhalation of sulphur which is produced by\npyrites. This seems for the most part to be precipitated at its very birth,\nand so that revolting smell is the effect of its separation.\nThe following are indications of separation:\n1. There is a certain whitish \u0002ower which \u0002oats on all waters of this\nkind, and grows everywhere around the edges of springs of this kind.\nThe \u0002ower moreover is pure sulphur. In addition contact with the\nedges stains silver \u0003rst a yellowish color, and then black, which is\nthe effect of the same sulphur.\nPage 93\n2. Then there is very black mud, which is also sulphurous.\n3. Straws and stones in these springs are stained purple.\n4. Likewise the water of these springs tends to be cloudy, at least in\ncomparison with others.\n5. All mineral waters, at least the inky-black ones, which to that extent\nwe have shown develop from pyrites, if they are kept for some time\nin skins, produce the same sulphurous smell as those most famous\nones in the neighbourhood of Knaresborough.\n6. Salt springs, as has been suggested above, whose water is continually drawn off in large quantities do not smell rotten, and I have\nno doubt that this would also occur in the case of stinking springs\nif their waters were drawn in copious and unremitting amounts.\n7. When the water is boiled a little it loses its stinking smell and property\nof staining silver, as its sulphurous exhalation is driven off and dies.\nPage 94\nThe sustained rancid nature of the water may be the cause, at least in\npart, of the separation, and it occurs because the water \u0003rst stagnates\nthere from some chance event. And in truth all these springs are stated\nto be either stagnant or very sluggish.\nWe should also count in this group of causes the abundance of\ncommon salt.\nPage 95\nChapter XII\nA brief examination of the various substances which the mineral springs of England\nare said by our British writers to contain.\n\nPages 280:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n263\nThe mineral springs of England are said to contain other substances\nwhich vary with the writer, and these writers of ours are not few in\nnumber. The reason for such great diversity seems to be that they all\nsought to \u0003nd vitriol alone, but failed. However I shall now brie\u0002y\nexamine the individual substances which have been listed by others.\nFirst, for some reason or other, most of our fellow-countrymen have\nfound nitre.\nBut nitre has, one might almost say, been metamorphosed into the\nsaltpetre and halonitrum of more recent writers. It is however true that\nit has been discovered scarcely anywhere else\nPage 96\nthan where animals have frequented the area.96 It is hard to imagine\nit being produced in the depths of the earth, beneath very mountains,\nthrough which most mineral springs \u0002ow.\nIt may be that saltpetre can be formed in some manner, although no\nnitrous stone occurs naturally so that either pyrites or limestone must\nprovide the material for nitre.\nI leave it for future generations to work out and bring to fruition\nthe question as to whether these stones must be steeped in urine or\nprepared in some other way before they can develop.\nYet although no stones are naturally nitrous, yet there is a certain\nsoil containing that fertile salt, and once it is made fertile with that salt\nit retains its results for some time. Of course this same nitrous soil is\nexhausted of its salt by the application of heat, but if it is kept in a\nplace free from the injuries done by the winds and rain, it is said once\nmore to abound in new nitre.\nPage 97\nBut the winds and rain merely dissipate the immature salt. The cause\nof fertility lies in the soil itself.\nYet a number of writers af\u0003rm that the salts of some springs commonly develop into droplets like icicles.97 A sure indication of nitre!\n96\nThis was a reference to the fact that a major source of nitre was the deposits\ncrystallizing from cave walls or privies, or other organic matter that was decomposing.\nAmmonia from the decomposition of urea in dung heaps would produce nitrate.\n97\nLister here is referring to Wittie\u2019s experiments in his work, Scarsbrough Spaw. William Simpson, in his Hydrologia Chymica remarked on Wittie\u2019s assertions that nitre was\n\nPages 281:\n264\nappendix\nI have also had so called oil of vitriol which has solidi\u0003ed into icicles\nin winter, and I have kept them in this condition in my house for a\nlong time. My friend Coxius states the same in Philosophical Transactions N.103.98 I have noted above how even sea salt has solidi\u0003ed into\nicicles. But these conditions arise rather from some sort of evaporation\nor solidi\u0003cation than from the nature of the salt. But grant that then\nsalt of some springs does develop to some extent naturally into some\nshapeless icicles. Yet the other more signi\u0003cant properties of nitre are\nby the admission of these same authors not to be found. They can for\nexample be made to burn suddenly with a slender colored \u0002ame while\nproducing a bang and a \u0002ash; their crystals are hexagonal, &amp;c.\nPage 98\nConcerning nitre I am of the opinion of the ancients, that it does not\nnaturally occur anywhere in Europe, at least in our northern regions.\nIndeed, if you pay attention to the descriptions and accounts of the\nancients, salt of this kind appears to be peculiar to Africa and Asia,\nand to be quite different from our spurious kind.\nOthers declare that sea salt is present in some of our springs, yet\nit is not.\nIn many others however I have no doubt that it is present in inkyblack springs, except for the unpleasant smelling salt ones. I wish\nhowever that they would devote more attention to the cubic-rhomboid\nshape of raw vitriol if it has ever been found by any of those who\ninvestigate our springs.\nin spa water: \u201cThe other part of his argument, which he thinks is instar omnium, to\ncon\u0003rm his opinion of Nitre the chief ingredient, is this experiment, viz. that upon the\nexposing of the Minerals (as he calls the sediment left after evaporation of the water)\nsome while in a most and cold air, that there have been found stories or little Icicles\namong them, which is the form of Nitre, as to the veracity of the experiment we are\nnot incredulous, but that this should evince the preexistence of Nitre in that sediment,\nis the thing we contend and very much question.\u201d William Simpson, Hydrologica Chymica\n(London: W.G., 1669), p. 52.\n98\nSome Observations and Experiments about Vitriol, Tending to Find Out the\nNature of That Substance, and to Give Further Light in the Inquiry after the Principles\nand Properties of Other Minerals: Communicated by a Fellow of the R. Society, Who\nMaketh Use of Chymistry Chie\u0002y as Subservient to Physiology, Philosophical Transactions,\n9, 103 (1674), pp. 41\u201347. The article has no author in the Transactions, but its subject\nmanner makes it likely it is the work by Daniel Coxe to which Lister refers. See chapter\nthree for a discussion of Coxe\u2019s chymical experiments in the Royal Society.\n\nPages 282:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n265\nThere are others who contend most enthusiastically that in some of\nour inky-black waters alumen is present.\nPage 99\nThese also call on chemistry, but have little knowledge of minerals.99\nAgain they are wrong, since it is certain that they have taken the stones\nwith which they conduct their experiments from a pile of burnt aluminous rock. Even when these are only lightly burned they have still been\neither contaminated by the smoke or exposed for a suf\u0003cient time to\nthe consuming of their vitriol in air. I consider it most true that every\nrock, insofar as it is aluminous, if it has been very recently mined and\nis in its raw state, is incapable of turning the water in which it has been\nsteeped inky-black in conjunction with gall-nuts. My friend Wittius has\nattested this fact, and I have proved it by careful experiment. Yet the lye\nof aluminous stone that has been burned, or is even in its raw state, if\nit has been exposed suf\u0003ciently long in air, becomes inky-black to the\nextent that it contains pyrites.\nMany authorities demonstrate that pyrites is everywhere mixed with\nthe ore of alumen.\nPage 100\nOf course at the top of a pile of burned stone an abundance of sulphur,\nwhich is the genuine offspring of pyrites, can be found. But pyrites itself\ncan also be seen in the same place from its golden sheen. And a careful\ninvestigator, if he uses a magnet appropriately, will come across it almost\neverywhere in the actual aluminous ore. I can testify myself that I have\nsome extremely pure soil from Ireland which contains an abundance\nof alumen, which I still keep carefully in my house. Alumen however\ncontinually ef\u0002oresces from this ore as vitriol does from pyrites.\nWhen however after a development of several months I examined\nthese aluminous hair-like excrescences, they failed completely to turn\nthe water in which they were dissolved inky-black in conjunction with\ngall-nuts. Furthermore aluminous \u2018strands\u2019 remained ever white even\n99\nThe debate was published in the Philosophical Transactions. In \u201cPart of two Letters\nfrom Dr. Cay. To Martin Lister . . . concerning some Mineral Waters,\u201d pp. 365\u2013370.\nCay criticizes an unnamed investigator for presuming that alum was present in ferruginous waters.\n\nPages 283:\n266\nappendix\nafter growing for a year, although strands of vitriol turn green immediately after their birth.\nPage 101\nLikewise it is easy for anyone to discern that they were alumen either\nfrom their sweetish taste, which is very harsh. Concerning the crystals\nof alumen and vitriol I have explained above how they differ. Yet the\npure ore of alumen, free from all pyrites, is very rarely found as far as\nI know, at least in Britain.\nIn addition there is the fact that alumen has a severely binding effect\non the stomach, whilst our inky-black minerals, in which it is said to have\nan abundant presence, loosen the bowels, as do the waters of the spring\nat Scarborough and the stinking sulphur springs near Harrogate.\nOthers again (so that I may not omit any of the improbable claims\nmade by others) assert that the very ochre from the spring at Scarborough is aluminous earth, or the ore of alumen. But these can hardly\nhave trusted the evidence afforded by a magnet, which is unimpeachable.\nFor that very ochre which is separated by the application of heat\nPage 102\nif it is burned in the proper way, will happily be attracted to a magnet,\nand if it is kept for a longish time in a damp atmosphere will even\nproduce the green vitriol of iron. I can testify to these facts from my\nown experience.\nBut it is further objected that the contents of the waters of this\nlast named spring, and of certain others which also have inky-black\nwaters, like those of the hot springs at Bath, grow white even if they\nare calcinated for a longish time.\nMy reply is that in hot springs and elsewhere in cold mineral springs\nochre is wont to disappear; the reason is lies in its gas-like nature, which\nis certainly unique, as has been explained above.\nLikewise if a moderate heat is applied, it is only partially separated,\nsince it is deposited either spontaneously or when gall-nuts are added.\nAnd so there is no doubt that it is contained in certain inky-black\nwaters. Likewise in other waters, such as those in Malton, even the\ncalcinated contents,\n\nPages 284:\nEXERCISES ON THE HEALING SPRINGS OF ENGLAND (1684)\n267\nPage 103\nsuch as burned ochre, develop a bright red color. And they grow white\nfrom a shortage of ochre. Therefore it does not follow that for that\nreason ochre itself was not present in those waters in which it can be\nshown by many other arguments that it was present. Again, even if a\nmagnet attracts none of the contents after they have been burned, it is\nnevertheless credible that iron ore could have been present there.\nFor the magnet does not attract vitriol made from steel, even if it\nis thoroughly heated, as I have proven. And so it must be very carefully cleansed of the remaining parts mixed with it, especially those\nof a saline nature, in order that the proof afforded by a magnet may\nproperly succeed.\nConcerning the bitumen in the hot springs at Bath, I have nothing\nwhich I can af\u0003rm from my particular collections made in May, June\nand July. I am not yet certain that it is bitumen, for I have received from\ntwo honest men who are natives of that city a largish quantity\nPage 104\nof that so-called bitumen.100 Yet I can con\u0003rm that it consisted entirely\nof scrapings of dirt from bodies, and nothing besides. In addition it is\nsaid to be collected only in those months when the baths are particularly crowded.\n100\nI do not know who these two \u201chonest men\u201d were, as a search of the relevant\nLister letters in the Duke Humfrey did not reveal any bitumen deliveries to Lister in\nthe 1670s. Lister does however mention in the Philosophical Transactions that \u201cI made all\nthe Wiches or noted Salt Springs in my way home from Bath, the last Summer, and\nspent some few hours in the examining of them . . . But before I proceed I must needs\nbear witness to the truth of Dr. Guidots experiments, most of which I tried my self\nat Bath, and \u0003nd him to be a most Authentic and faithful writer. I do only yet doubt\nof the existence of Bitrumen for I cannot \u0003nd the Floating Scum when dryed to have\nany such thing in it.\u201d See Martin Lister, \u201cCertain Observations of the Midland SaltSprings of Worcester-Shire, Stafford-Shire and Cheshire,\u201d p. 489.\n\nPages 285:\n\nPages 286:\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nManuscripts\nHartlib, Samuel.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 274 to 294 of the document, which explore various experiments on the <strong>healing springs of England</strong>, covering topics such as:

1. <strong>The Nature of Volatile Salts and Heat Production</strong>: Salts were often linked to heat, but experiments showed that salts in water do not always produce heat unless they have undergone a <strong>chemical distillation</strong> or other reactions.
2. <strong>Origins of Rain</strong>: Theories suggest that the water cycle, especially rain, was partly produced by interactions between underground salts, pyrites, and limestone.
3. <strong>The Role of Plants and Transpiration</strong>: Research by figures like <strong>Robert Plot</strong> demonstrated how plants, through their breath, play an essential role in water cycles and rain production.
4. <strong>Sulfurous Springs</strong>: These mineral springs were analyzed for their sulfur content, with observations about their <strong>white sulfurous flower</strong> and staining properties on metals.

Hence the blood will\nbe apt to abound with volatile Salt, when it is not suf\u0003ciently impregnated\nwith this Acid.186\nRobinson then explained that a lack of acid in the blood was most\nlikely to happen in hot weather, when the air contained less acid. This\nwas because there were more sulphureous steams and volatile salts in\nthe atmosphere that were raised from the earth in hot weather. Salts\nalso arose from putrid substances of vegetables and animals in warmer\nclimes, and the heat meant people were likely more inactive or had\nmore putrid fevers, and their blood and breath tended to abound with\nvolatile salts.\nRobinson\u2019s theory at its basis had its origin in the work of van\nHelmont, who we have seen originated the study of volatile salts in\na primarily iatrochymical and medical context. In his analysis of the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nfrom the former.\u201d4 Because \u0003re was merely a secondary element, Van\nHelmont disagreed with the ef\u0003cacy of \u0003re analysis. Like Erastus, he\nbelieved that heat created new compounds rather than revealing the\nbuilding blocks of a substance; \u201csalt, sulphur and mercury were thus\nnot true principles, but were produced by the heat of analysis.\u201d5\nFor Van Helmont, salts in particular were \u201coffspring of the waters,\u201d\nand if exposed to the Sun, \u201care made aiery and vapoury Ef\u0002uxes,\nrushing into water with a hastened Violence.\u201d6 In other words, some\nsalts could be powerfully volatile. Volatile salts referred to salts that\ngave off an aeriform component (such as an odor), but also to salts that\ndecomposed easily on heating. Boyle\u2019s de\u0003nition of volatile was even\nmore speci\u0003c; he believed the corpuscular bits of volatile matter had to\nbe \u201cvery small\u201d so they are more \u201ceasily put into motion by the action of\nthe Fire and other agents.\u201d7 The speci\u0003c volatile salts that van Helmont,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=22\nPages: 22,23\nThe effects of volatile salts (in early modern chymistry, those that\nhave an odor and were reactive to heat), particularly of vitriol (ferrous\nsulphate) and saltpeter (potassium nitrate also known as nitre) were at\nthe center of these studies in natural history.13 This may have been\nbecause the crystals of the salts of vitriol are large and prominent,\nand because sulphuric and nitric acids produced spectacular and often\n10\nFrederic L.

One then made a compound with the salt, and submitted it to a gentle heat; arising from the ashes were salt crystals which\nresembled a stem, leaves and \u0003owers, an apparition of the plant which\nhad been submitted to combustion.36 Although the salt had been reduced\n31\nDuchesne, Practice of Chymicall Physicke, fol.

In settling down, it \u201csnatches\u201d\nparticles of less subtle nature\u2014so called sulphurous particles\u2014which are\nincorporated in the deposit. The \u0003xed salt being unable to \u0003x all the sulphur particles, the rest, which have escaped being snatched, follow their\nnatural tendency to become volatile and in their turn force some of the\nsalt to evaporate with them. Thus, volatile salt is generated. When heated\nin an open vessel all salt contained in the substance evaporates. This is\nwhat happens to the . . . [venous] blood in the . . . lung, that is where it\nis in contact with the air. All its salt has become volatile whereby it is\ndisposable by the breath.11\nClericuzio has in turn shown that \u201cEnglish Helmontians based their\nphysiological theories on the notion of vital spirits, which they conceived as a volatile alkaline salt.\u201d12 Physicians such as Francis Glisson\n(1597\u20131677), Walter Charleton (1619\u20131707), and Thomas Willis (1621\u2013]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=135\nPages: 135\nand acid also was important. The deeper in the earth it occurred, the\nmore precipitated the Sulphur became, \u201cleft in the colander or \u0003lter of\nSand, through which its passeth, and the acidum thereby so dinted as\nto become very Languid.\u201d40 Surface baths were thus more chemically\npotent and hotter then those below ground.\nThe fermentation process producing heat in the baths of course required\nspring water, and the transformation of sulphurous vitriol into oil of\nvitriol (sulphuric acid) via arti\u0003cial distillation or the natural mixture of\nvitriol and sulphur in spring water to produce oil of vitriol illustrated\nthis principle.

The abundance of limestone around\npyrite minerals, as well as mists around the springs also led him to this\nconclusion.114\nIn asserting the centrality of pyrites in heating mineral springs, Lister\n\u0003rst claimed that the warm sulphurous gases produced by vitriolic salts\nfrom pyrites was evidenced by mine explosions in which gases would\naccumulate, and the fact that mineshafts and underground tunnels of\nhot springs were \u201cvery warm\u201d in the \u201cwhole of winter.\u201d115 There was\nalso no other substance prevalent around mineral springs that he knew\nof apart from volatile salts from pyrites and limestone that gave off a\n112\nLister, De Fontibus, part II, p. 72.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=274\nPages: 274\nbetween some kind of salt which eats substances away and metallic\niron.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The discussion of <strong>volatile salts</strong> and <strong>heat production</strong> in early modern natural philosophy highlights the evolving understanding of chemical and physiological processes, particularly how salts interacted with heat and air. Here is a detailed dive into the subject, drawing from the document&#x27;s content:

### <strong>1. The Nature of Volatile Salts</strong>

In early modern chymistry, <strong>volatile salts</strong> were a key concept. They referred to salts that could vaporize or give off an aeriform component, often an odor, under heat. The idea of volatile salts was rooted in <strong>Van Helmont&#x27;s</strong> (1580–1644) work, where salts were believed to originate from water and become volatile upon exposure to heat or air. Van Helmont&#x27;s <strong>iatrochymical</strong> theory positioned salts as intermediaries between fixed, solid substances and their gaseous or fluid forms. This dual nature of salts allowed them to play an essential role in both the material and spiritual transformations in nature and the human body.

- &quot;For Van Helmont, salts in particular were &#x27;offspring of the waters&#x27;... and if exposed to the Sun, &#x27;are made airy and vapoury effluxes, rushing into water with a hastened Violence.&#x27;” [Page 65](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=65).

Volatile salts were linked with processes of <strong>respiration</strong>, <strong>digestion</strong>, and <strong>combustion</strong>, where the interaction between heat and substances released these volatile components. This transformation was seen as critical for both <strong>physiological function</strong> and <strong>material reactions</strong>.

### <strong>2. Heat Production and Chemical Reactions</strong>

In terms of heat production, volatile salts were particularly associated with <strong>exothermic reactions</strong>. These reactions, common with salts like <strong>vitriol (ferrous sulphate)</strong> and <strong>saltpeter (potassium nitrate)</strong>, were central to both practical chemical applications and natural philosophical discussions. When these salts reacted with acids or other agents, they produced <strong>spectacular</strong> and often <strong>violent heat</strong>.

- &quot;Volatile salts referred to salts that gave off an aeriform component (such as an odor), but also to salts that decomposed easily on heating.&quot; [Page 65](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=65).
- <strong>William Simpson&#x27;s</strong> experiments showed that when salts were exposed to acids or heat, they produced a violent fermentation, which generated heat. This was a significant discovery, as it tied the production of heat in springs to chemical reactions between salts, especially those involving <strong>pyrites</strong> (sulphur-containing minerals). 

- “If water was added again to oil of vitriol, a violent Fermentation occurred, the exothermic reaction producing violent heat.” [Page 135](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=135).

### <strong>3. Volatile Salts in the Human Body and Atmosphere</strong>

Volatile salts were also tied to <strong>physiological processes</strong>, such as respiration and the action of <strong>vital spirits</strong>. Early Helmontian physicians, like <strong>Francis Glisson</strong> and <strong>Thomas Willis</strong>, believed that volatile salts could agitate the <strong>vital spirits</strong> within the body, restoring health and energy. This concept was central to early understandings of <strong>respiration</strong>, where volatile salts in the air combined with the blood in the lungs, sustaining life.

- &quot;Volatile salts being received into the vast subtile fluid [atmosphere]... becomes the instrument of sundry remarkable effects and operations, not only in natural, but also in artificial productions.&quot; [Page 24](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=24).

Volatile salts were also believed to be a key factor in atmospheric phenomena. For instance, they were thought to influence <strong>weather</strong>, producing rain and thunderstorms by interacting with air and water. These salts were also tied to the warming effects of <strong>mineral springs</strong>, where the release of volatile salts from underground minerals like pyrites was believed to heat the water.

- &quot;Volatile salts from pyrites and limestone were responsible for the heating of mineral waters, producing warmth without combustion.&quot; [Page 94](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=94).

### <strong>4. From Volatile Salts to Modern Chemistry</strong>

The transition from the <strong>Helmontian theory</strong> of volatile salts to modern chemistry occurred gradually as scientists began to understand the role of <strong>gases</strong> and other chemical agents in respiration and heat production. The discovery of <strong>oxygen</strong> as a key component in <strong>combustion</strong> and <strong>respiration</strong> led to the decline of the concept of volatile salts as the primary agents in these processes. However, the study of volatile salts laid the groundwork for important discoveries in early chemical science, particularly the role of <strong>acids</strong> and <strong>alkalis</strong> in reactions.

In conclusion, <strong>volatile salts</strong> were central to early modern theories of <strong>heat production</strong>, <strong>chemical reactions</strong>, and <strong>physiological processes</strong>. Through their volatile nature, these salts connected the physical and spiritual realms in alchemical and iatrochemical theories, influencing both material transformations and the understanding of the human body. These ideas would eventually evolve into more modern chemical theories, marking a key transition from alchemical to scientific explanations of the natural world.

Boyle also was involved\nin the classi\u0003cation of salts. As has been documented by Clericuzio,\nin his Usefulness of Experimental Naturall Philosophy (1663) Boyle classi\u0003ed\nsalts comprehensively and distinguished three types: acid, alkalizate or\nlixivial, and urinous or volatile. Principe and Newman have also demonstrated that Boyle drew a contrast between the Helmontian alkahest\nand \u201ccommon corrosive saline liquors\u201d or acids and alkalis.7 The liquors,\nderived from salts via distillation, deliquescence, lixiviation, and solution\nwere of three types: acid (such as nitric acid), urinous (ammonia and\nits salts), and alkalizates (\u0003xed alkalies such as potassium and sodium\ncarbonates). Boyle further derived a set of early \u201cPh\u201d indicators, such\nas syrup of violets to classify salts and their liquors into acid, urinous\nor lixivial types.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=111\nPages: 111\nMarine salts produced right angles, and alkaline salts were square at\none end, and pointed at the other; placed ended to end, alkaline salts\nwould form oblique angles.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a continuation of the list of salts mentioned in the text, with their associated theories, chemical explanations, and page numbers:

9. <strong>Salt of Tartar (Potassium Carbonate)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Commonly used in alchemical and medical practices, particularly for its ability to neutralize acids and purify substances.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: K₂CO₃, a white salt derived from plant ashes, is used in soap-making and as a leavening agent in baking. It was also employed in alchemical experiments to catalyze reactions.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 94](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=94).

10. <strong>Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)</strong>  
    - <strong>Theory</strong>: Used for medicinal purposes, particularly in treating gout and other ailments by purging the body of toxins.
    - <strong>Explanation</strong>: MgSO₄·7H₂O forms small crystals and is soluble in water. It is used as a laxative and for treating sore muscles.
    - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 87](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=87).

11. <strong>Sal Ammoniac (Ammonium Chloride)</strong>  
    - <strong>Theory</strong>: Key component in the sublimation process of alchemy, where it was used in metalworking and as a flux in soldering.
    - <strong>Explanation</strong>: NH₄Cl forms colorless, cubic crystals. It was known for its ability to clean metals and as a precursor for ammonia.
    - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 58](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=58).

12. <strong>Salt of Hartshorn (Ammonium Carbonate)</strong>  
    - <strong>Theory</strong>: Used in medical treatments to restore consciousness and treat respiratory conditions due to its volatile nature.
    - <strong>Explanation</strong>: (NH₄)₂CO₃ is derived from the distillation of bones or horns and used in smelling salts. It vaporizes easily, producing a sharp odor.
    - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 31](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=31).

13. <strong>Marine Salts (Sodium Chloride with Impurities)</strong>  
    - <strong>Theory</strong>: Involved in the preservation of food and considered essential for the generation of life in the sea. Marine salts were believed to differ chemically from salts found in springs.
    - <strong>Explanation</strong>: NaCl with various mineral impurities, such as magnesium and calcium, giving the salt its unique properties in sea water.
    - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 232](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=232).

14. <strong>Fixed Alkaline Salts (Potassium and Sodium Carbonates)</strong>  
    - <strong>Theory</strong>: Classified by <strong>Robert Boyle</strong> into three types: acid, alkalizate (lixivial), and urinous (volatile). Fixed alkaline salts were fundamental in neutralizing acids and used in a wide range of alchemical reactions.
    - <strong>Explanation</strong>: K₂CO₃ and Na₂CO₃ are extracted from plant ashes and were used for soap making and glass production.

It was also possible to discern\nwhich type of salt in a sample was predominant, whether sulphureous,\n\u0002xed, or mercurious, by taste.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are additional types of salts mentioned in the text, without repetition:

15. <strong>Nitrum Calcarium (Calcium Nitrate)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Identified as a fossil salt, this type of salt is abundant in nature, particularly in limestone formations. Lister&#x27;s observation suggested its role in crystallization.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Ca(NO₃)₂ forms through the interaction of nitric acid with calcium-containing materials. It is commonly used as a fertilizer due to its high solubility in water.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 229](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=229).

16. <strong>Antimony Salts</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Debated as a possible formative salt responsible for the generation of matter, especially in the context of mineral creation (minerallogenesis).
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Salts of antimony (such as antimony chloride, SbCl₃) were widely used in early medicine and alchemy for their purgative and emetic properties. 
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 30](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=30).

17. <strong>Alumen (Aluminum Sulphate)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: A widely used double salt, known for its role in water purification and as a mordant in dyeing and tanning processes.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Al₂(SO₄)₃·K₂SO₄·24H₂O forms octahedral crystals and was commonly referred to as &quot;alum.&quot; This salt was essential in fixing dyes to fabrics and clarifying water.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 230](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=230).

18. <strong>Lixivial Salts (Sodium and Potassium Carbonates)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: These fixed salts were central to neutralizing acids in both alchemical and medical practices. They were obtained through the burning of plant materials and ashes.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Na₂CO₃ and K₂CO₃ are basic salts commonly found in ashes. They form through the calcination of organic matter and were used in soap-making and as flux in metallurgy.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 128](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128).

19. <strong>Salt of Metals (Various Metal Sulphates)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: The idea that salts form the fundamental body of metals, proposed by early modern chymists. Precipitation of salts was seen as the materialization of metals in nature.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Metal sulphates (such as copper sulphate, CuSO₄) crystallize from solutions and were used in various chemical processes, including electroplating and purification.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 37](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=37).

20. <strong>Acidic Saline Spirits</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: The early 18th-century chymical shift toward recognizing acids as active agents in natural processes, particularly for respiration and fermentation.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Acidic saline spirits, such as nitric acid (HNO₃) or hydrochloric acid (HCl), were increasingly understood to drive chemical reactions, particularly when mixed with bases or other salts.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 20](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=20).

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is an alphabetized list of historical thinkers mentioned in the text, including their dates, theories, chemical discoveries, and page numbers:

1. <strong>Johann Glauber (1604–1670)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Developed the concept of <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong> (sodium sulphate), which he believed played a role in the <strong>generation of metals</strong> and medical applications. He emphasized the medicinal and chemical significance of salts in natural processes.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Glauber was one of the first to isolate <strong>sodium sulphate</strong> (Na₂SO₄) and explore its uses in both alchemical and medical contexts.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 55](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=55).

2. <strong>Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Studied the <strong>chemical nature of plants</strong> and proposed that salts were responsible for their colors and growth processes. He connected <strong>volatile salts</strong> with <strong>plant physiology</strong>.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Grew’s experiments with plant tinctures showed how volatile salts affected color changes in plants, linking <strong>salt chemistry</strong> with plant growth and health.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 115](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=115).

3. <strong>Paracelsus (1493–1541)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Introduced the concept of the <strong>tria prima</strong>—salt, sulphur, and mercury—as the fundamental elements of matter. Salt, in his view, represented the <strong>material body</strong> and played a crucial role in both alchemy and medicine.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Paracelsus’s salt theory redefined the material body as stable and indestructible, contrasting the volatility of sulphur and mercury. He used salts in medical treatments, emphasizing their role in maintaining bodily balance.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 36](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=36).

4. <strong>Robert Boyle (1627–1691)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Advanced the study of <strong>acids and alkalis</strong>, proposing that acids were the primary agents of chemical change. He conducted experiments with <strong>lixivial salts</strong> and acids, linking them to broader chemical transformations.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Boyle’s work in <strong>acid-base reactions</strong> laid the foundation for modern chemical understanding of salts. He explored how acids and salts interacted to cause material change and neutralize each other.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 128](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128).

5. <strong>Bryan Robinson (1680–1754)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Applied Newtonian ideas to <strong>respiration</strong>, proposing that acidic particles in the air combined with blood to sustain life. He also connected <strong>volatile salts</strong> with atmospheric phenomena like thunderstorms.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His work bridged Newtonian physics and alchemical theories, proposing that acids and salts in the atmosphere were responsible for both physiological processes and weather events.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 169](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=169).

6. <strong>Johann van Helmont (1580–1644)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Proposed that <strong>volatile salts</strong> and gases were central to bodily processes, including <strong>digestion</strong> and <strong>respiration</strong>. He developed the idea of <strong>fermentation</strong> as a chemical process driven by acids and volatile salts.  
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Van Helmont’s work on <strong>volatile salts</strong> and gases laid the groundwork for the later discovery of <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> and its role in fermentation and digestion.  
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 65](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=65).

My exploration of natural history\u2019s\nintersection with chemical investigation in early modern England, particularly amongst early Royal Society members, proved a ripe area to\nexplore the growing importance of the senses and experience as causes\nof intellectual change in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While\nthe concept of the Paracelsian tria prima of salt, sulphur, and mercury is\nimportant to consider in tracing the source of these ideas, I argue the\nwork of the physician Johann Van Helmont was at their base.\n3. Argue that analyzing to what extent the alchemical understanding of salts was modi\u0002ed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nis crucial to our understanding of the transition between alchemy and\nchymistry.

8. <strong>Francis Glisson (1597–1677)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Known for his work on the <strong>anatomy of the liver</strong>, Glisson was among the early theorists to propose that <strong>volatile salts</strong> were crucial for physiological processes.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His research contributed to the understanding of the role of salts in biological systems, particularly in the context of human anatomy and digestion.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 296](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=296).

9. <strong>Martin Lister (1639–1712)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Lister conducted significant work on <strong>natural history</strong> and the role of <strong>salts in pyrites</strong>, contributing to meteorological theories and <strong>minerallogenesis</strong>. He argued for the presence of salts in the atmosphere and linked them to fossil formation.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His research on <strong>salts from pyrites</strong> was foundational in understanding how salts influence mineral formation, particularly in springs and geological formations.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 81](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=81).

10. <strong>Isaac Newton (1642–1727)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Newton applied his <strong>mechanical philosophy</strong> to natural phenomena, including respiration and tides. His works like *Opticks* included ideas about acids and their role in natural processes.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Although more famous for his physics, Newton’s alchemical works speculated on <strong>acids</strong> and <strong>saline spirits</strong>, particularly in the context of <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>combustion</strong>.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 25](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=25).

11. <strong>Johann Heinrich Cohausen (1665–1750)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: A satirical figure in medical history, Cohausen criticized exaggerated claims of <strong>life extension</strong> through alchemical means. His satirical work, *Hermippus Redivivus*, poked fun at the quest for longevity.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Although his contributions were largely satirical, his work reflects the medical and chemical theories of his time, particularly those involving <strong>acids</strong> and <strong>respiration</strong>.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 210](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=210).

12. <strong>Thomas Philipot (1614–1682)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Philipot was known for his work on <strong>tides</strong>, blending <strong>chymistry</strong>, natural philosophy, and occult forces to explain natural phenomena.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His work involved the exploration of <strong>fixed and volatile salts</strong>, particularly in relation to <strong>tidal mechanisms</strong>.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 70](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=70).

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is the continuation of the <strong>Who&#x27;s Who</strong> list of historical thinkers, alphabetized by last name, including their dates, theories, chemical discoveries, and page numbers:

13. <strong>John Mayow (1641–1679)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Investigated <strong>respiration</strong> and the role of air in combustion. He was one of the first to suggest that respiration involved the consumption of a vital component in the air, which he referred to as <strong>nitro-aerial particles</strong>.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: Mayow’s work anticipated the discovery of <strong>oxygen</strong>. His experiments with combustion and respiration laid the groundwork for understanding the role of gases in these processes.

14. <strong>Richard Mead (1673–1754)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Mead developed early ideas about <strong>solar and lunar effects on the human body</strong>, linking the movements of celestial bodies to physical and mental health.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: While not directly a chemist, Mead contributed to the <strong>physiological applications</strong> of chymical thought, emphasizing the relationship between <strong>environmental factors</strong> (like light and air) and human health.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 433](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=433).

15. <strong>Joseph Priestley (1733–1804)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Known for his work on <strong>respiration</strong> and the <strong>nature of gases</strong>. Priestley discovered several gases, including <strong>oxygen</strong>, which he called &quot;dephlogisticated air.&quot;
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His research into gases fundamentally changed the understanding of air and respiration, particularly through his work on oxygen and its role in combustion and breathing.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 300](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=300).

16. <strong>William Croone (1633–1684)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Focused on the <strong>nature of muscles</strong> and their contraction, applying early chymical principles to understand biological functions.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His experiments on the <strong>function of muscles</strong> contributed to early physiological chemistry, particularly in understanding how bodily processes relate to the physical properties of matter.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 299](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=299).

17. <strong>George Ernst Stahl (1659–1734)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Developed the <strong>phlogiston theory</strong>, which posited that a fire-like element called <strong>phlogiston</strong> was released during combustion.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His work on phlogiston, although later disproven, was a key stepping stone in the development of modern chemistry, influencing the understanding of <strong>combustion</strong> and <strong>oxidation</strong>.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 294](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=294).

18. <strong>Stephen Hales (1677–1761)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Known for his studies on <strong>plant physiology</strong> and his work on the <strong>pneumatic trough</strong>, which allowed the collection of gases from reactions.
   - <strong>Chemical Discoveries</strong>: His invention of the <strong>pneumatic trough</strong> was crucial in early gas chemistry, providing a way to collect gases released during chemical reactions, laying the groundwork for the study of gases.

This led\nhim to conclude that in \u201cmost Plants, the Preadominant Principle is\nan Acid,\u201d particularly in the parenchyma, whereas animal substances\ncontained more alkalis.193 Grew also argued that plants contained\nsulphur, especially in the wood, as there was a large amount of resinous sap in the wood\u2019s lympheducts, the sap having the same oily and\n\u0002ammable properties of sulphureous substances. He then performed a\nseries of experiments in which he dropped the alkali spirit of hartshorn\n(aqueous solution of ammonia) or sal ammoniac on tinctures of \u0002owers and on leaves. Spirit of Hartshorn on tinctures of borage \u0002ower\nturned them \u201cverdigreese Green,\u201d and when it was dropped on green\nleaves, the color did not change at all, leading him to postulate that\nthere was some alkaline \u201cor like salt in the Air, which is predominant]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=152\nPages: 152\nthat \u201cacrimonious in\u0002uences were ascribed to speci\u0003c \u0002uids,\u201d including\nthe lymph and that \u201ccharacteristic diseases resulted from their acidic\nor alkaline natures.\u201d120 Too acidic conditions or alkaline conditions in\nbodily \u0002uids caused disease, a state to be countered with appropriate\nbasic or acidic medicaments to restore the balance of the humors.121\nHarold Cook has shown the simplistic division of all chymical substances\ninto acids and alkalis made this theory an extremely popular and often\nmisused medical treatment among the populace in the United Kingdom\nin the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.122\nMead also was not above using trendy vocabulary to boost his medical\npractice. As he later rather cynically advised another young physician,\nTimothy Vanbustle:\nShould you have an itching to make your name known by writing a book\non physic, yet so customary, I will advise you to choose the subject by\nwhich you think you will get most money, or that will bring you the most]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=140\nPages: 140\nTo support his assertion, Simpson \u0003rst cited a number of authorities,\nincluding Tachenius and Oleus Borrichius. Tachenius in his Hippocrates\nChimicus (1666) claimed that no fermentation, creation or decay of\nanimals and plants could occur without acids.63 Olaus Borrichius in his\nDe Hermetica Aegyptiorum vetere et Paracelsiorum Nova Medicina (Helmstadt,\n1648), likewise stated that acids and sulphurs formed an intrinsic part\nof all animals.\nAcids were thus claimed to be differently composed to make up the\nmodi\u0003cations of bodies, and classi\u0003ed as actively fermenting and \u0002uid,\nor passive and consistent of matter: \u201cFrom which succlency of Acids\ntogether with intermediate coagulations and hardenings, perform\u2019d at\ndue seasons, all concrete bodies in the threefold Kingdoms of nature are\nproduc\u2019d.\u201d64 As an example, Simpson showed how acids and sulphurs\naccounted for plant growth. Though as Van Helmont postulated, the\nbulk of all living creatures including plants was ultimately water,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220\nPages: 220\nJoseph Black and Lavoisier.25 The idea of a universal atmospheric acid\nwas also still common even until the 1770s; George Stahl, the inventor\nof the concept of phlogiston, mentioned the subject of acidi\u0002cation in\nhis treatise on salts. Stahl thought that vitriolic acid [sulphuric acid]\nwas the fundamental or \u201cuniversal acid\u201d and widespread in the atmosphere, an opinion shared by many eighteenth-century chemists.26 As\nCrosland has noted, the discovery of carbon dioxide or \u201c\u0002xed air\u201d by\nJoseph Black in 1754 provided the \u201cpossibility of a new direction to\nthe tradition\u2014the Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman suggested that\n\u201c\u0002xed air\u201d be called the \u201caerial acid.\u201d27 J.F. Meyer also postulated a\nuniversal acidum pingue a single acid, of which the other acids were later\nmodi\u0002cations, providing \u201can alternative explanation to that of Black of\nthe difference between mild and caustic (acidic) agents.\u201d28\nLavoisier himself was familiar with French translation of Meyer\u2019s]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=222\nPages: 222\nit and acids. These etymologies in his words were to \u201crelive the memories\nof beginners, who retain with dif\u0002culty a new word when it is absolutely\nempty of meaning.\u201d35 In his schema, salts were named in terms of the\nacids that they could become, and in his system he con\u0002dently named\n\u201ctwenty-two simple substances . . . not yet isolated, forming names from\nan individuating simple substance or radical and the relevant acid\u2014for\nexample\u2014\u201ccitric radical.\u201d36 The undiscovered bases of the undecomposed acids, he was sure would be readily uncovered now that the\nchemistry of oxygen was better understood. As he asserted,\nThat the number of the acids that one can form is again absolutely\nindeterminate, since one does not know all the substances that are likely\nto combine itself with the acidifying principle, and that one knows again\nless the means that one can employ to succeed in the combination.37\nIn this way, Lavoisier\u2019s nomenclature created a conceptual map to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128\nPages: 128\nthe nature of \u0003xed alkaline salts created by calcining plants was a\nresearch preoccupation of the Royal Society. Boyle also was involved\nin the classi\u0003cation of salts. As has been documented by Clericuzio,\nin his Usefulness of Experimental Naturall Philosophy (1663) Boyle classi\u0003ed\nsalts comprehensively and distinguished three types: acid, alkalizate or\nlixivial, and urinous or volatile. Principe and Newman have also demonstrated that Boyle drew a contrast between the Helmontian alkahest\nand \u201ccommon corrosive saline liquors\u201d or acids and alkalis.7 The liquors,\nderived from salts via distillation, deliquescence, lixiviation, and solution\nwere of three types: acid (such as nitric acid), urinous (ammonia and\nits salts), and alkalizates (\u0003xed alkalies such as potassium and sodium\ncarbonates). Boyle further derived a set of early \u201cPh\u201d indicators, such\nas syrup of violets to classify salts and their liquors into acid, urinous\nor lixivial types.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=125\nPages: 125\ninterest in the salt principle began to decline. Belief in the salt principle\ndiminished, and there was growing interest in the idea of a universal\nacid as the basic mover in processes of nature; it was usually identi\u0003ed\nas sulphuric acid.1 As Emerton has noted, in the seventeenth century,\nit was believed that acids or \u201csaline spirits\u201d were the most powerful\nchemical agents, and they were increasingly important in the chemical\nlaboratory as chemical reactions in solution predominated over older\ndistillation processes.2 The use of acids and alkalis in iatrochymical\ntreatments of Boerhaave and Franciscus Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius (1614\u20131672),\nas well as Boyle\u2019s re\u0003nement of colored indicators in detecting acidity\nled to this shift in emphasis.\nAfter a brief contextual discussion of the rise of acids and alkalis\nin chemical and iatrochymical theory, we will start this chapter with a\ndiscussion of William Simpson. Simpson was a physician from York who]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=140\nPages: 140,141\nmove towards decay, nothing is able to be begat of the new, unless it precedes acids.\u201d\n(sponte accessit, sicut et reliqui succi tum vegitabilium quam animalium, cum in putrifactionem tendunt:\nimo nil putrere neq; generari potest novi, nisi praecedat aciditas.)\n64\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 136.\n65\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 138.\n62\n124\nchapter four\nAcids \u201cwoven and condensed\u201d together formed stalks, leaves, and husks\nof plants, and fruit was \u201ccoagulations of acids, sweetened by their sulphurs, thereby brought on to maturity, and thence made \u0003t for other\nFermentations, in order to [create] potable liquors.\u201d66\nTherefore, though Grew believed salts were the \u201cbones of the plants,\u201d\nSimpson thought acids were at the heart of living structures, making\nnot only vegetation, but \u0002esh and muscular parts.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a detailed list of the types of acids mentioned in the document, along with theories and explanations, including molecular details where available, and page numbers:

1. <strong>Sulphuric Acid (Vitriolic Acid)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Recognized as a <strong>universal acid</strong> in early modern natural philosophy, particularly by <strong>George Stahl</strong>. Sulphuric acid was believed to be present in the atmosphere and was considered fundamental to many chemical reactions.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong mineral acid used in a variety of reactions, from fermentation to the generation of salts in the air.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 220](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220).

2. <strong>Nitric Acid</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Widely used for <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>combustion</strong> reactions. In <strong>Boyle’s classification</strong>, nitric acid was one of the key <strong>acidic liquors</strong> formed through distillation and solution processes.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Nitric acid (HNO₃) is a highly reactive acid, known for its strong oxidizing properties and its ability to dissolve metals.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 128](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128).

3. <strong>Aerial Acid (Carbon Dioxide)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: <strong>Joseph Black</strong> discovered that <strong>fixed air</strong> (carbon dioxide) acted as an acid, especially in fermentation processes. <strong>Torbern Bergman</strong> suggested renaming it as &quot;aerial acid,&quot; emphasizing its gaseous form.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Carbon dioxide (CO₂) plays a role in natural processes like respiration and carbonation. It was identified as an acid gas that reacts with water to form carbonic acid.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 220](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220).

4. <strong>Spirit of Hartshorn (Ammonium Hydroxide)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Used in <strong>plant and animal chemistry</strong> experiments. When applied to plant tinctures, it caused color changes, helping researchers classify plant chemicals.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH) is a weak base derived from ammonia, often used to neutralize acids.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 114](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=114).

5. <strong>Acidum Pingue (Fatty Acid)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Proposed by <strong>J.F. Meyer</strong>, this concept suggested that all other acids were <strong>modifications</strong> of a fundamental <strong>fatty acid</strong>. This theory provided an alternative explanation to <strong>Black’s carbon dioxide</strong> theory.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Fatty acids are carboxylic acids (R-COOH) found in fats and oils. Meyer’s concept emphasized the idea of a universal acid in natural processes.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 220](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220).

6. <strong>Saline Acids (Acidified Oxygen)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Following the discovery of oxygen, <strong>Lavoisier</strong> theorized that <strong>oxygen</strong> was the <strong>acidifying principle</strong>. This led to the idea that all acids are compounds of oxygen.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Oxygen (O₂), when combined with other elements, forms various acids (e.g., H₂SO₄ for sulphuric acid, HNO₃ for nitric acid).

This led\nhim to conclude that in \u201cmost Plants, the Preadominant Principle is\nan Acid,\u201d particularly in the parenchyma, whereas animal substances\ncontained more alkalis.193 Grew also argued that plants contained\nsulphur, especially in the wood, as there was a large amount of resinous sap in the wood\u2019s lympheducts, the sap having the same oily and\n\u0002ammable properties of sulphureous substances. He then performed a\nseries of experiments in which he dropped the alkali spirit of hartshorn\n(aqueous solution of ammonia) or sal ammoniac on tinctures of \u0002owers and on leaves. Spirit of Hartshorn on tinctures of borage \u0002ower\nturned them \u201cverdigreese Green,\u201d and when it was dropped on green\nleaves, the color did not change at all, leading him to postulate that\nthere was some alkaline \u201cor like salt in the Air, which is predominant]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=140\nPages: 140\nTo support his assertion, Simpson \u0003rst cited a number of authorities,\nincluding Tachenius and Oleus Borrichius. Tachenius in his Hippocrates\nChimicus (1666) claimed that no fermentation, creation or decay of\nanimals and plants could occur without acids.63 Olaus Borrichius in his\nDe Hermetica Aegyptiorum vetere et Paracelsiorum Nova Medicina (Helmstadt,\n1648), likewise stated that acids and sulphurs formed an intrinsic part\nof all animals.\nAcids were thus claimed to be differently composed to make up the\nmodi\u0003cations of bodies, and classi\u0003ed as actively fermenting and \u0002uid,\nor passive and consistent of matter: \u201cFrom which succlency of Acids\ntogether with intermediate coagulations and hardenings, perform\u2019d at\ndue seasons, all concrete bodies in the threefold Kingdoms of nature are\nproduc\u2019d.\u201d64 As an example, Simpson showed how acids and sulphurs\naccounted for plant growth.

As he later rather cynically advised another young physician,\nTimothy Vanbustle:\nShould you have an itching to make your name known by writing a book\non physic, yet so customary, I will advise you to choose the subject by\nwhich you think you will get most money, or that will bring you the most]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=140\nPages: 140,141\nmove towards decay, nothing is able to be begat of the new, unless it precedes acids.\u201d\n(sponte accessit, sicut et reliqui succi tum vegitabilium quam animalium, cum in putrifactionem tendunt:\nimo nil putrere neq; generari potest novi, nisi praecedat aciditas.)\n64\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 136.\n65\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 138.\n62\n124\nchapter four\nAcids \u201cwoven and condensed\u201d together formed stalks, leaves, and husks\nof plants, and fruit was \u201ccoagulations of acids, sweetened by their sulphurs, thereby brought on to maturity, and thence made \u0003t for other\nFermentations, in order to [create] potable liquors.\u201d66\nTherefore, though Grew believed salts were the \u201cbones of the plants,\u201d\nSimpson thought acids were at the heart of living structures, making\nnot only vegetation, but \u0002esh and muscular parts.

Stahl thought that vitriolic acid [sulphuric acid]\nwas the fundamental or \u201cuniversal acid\u201d and widespread in the atmosphere, an opinion shared by many eighteenth-century chemists.26 As\nCrosland has noted, the discovery of carbon dioxide or \u201c\u0002xed air\u201d by\nJoseph Black in 1754 provided the \u201cpossibility of a new direction to\nthe tradition\u2014the Swedish chemist Torbern Bergman suggested that\n\u201c\u0002xed air\u201d be called the \u201caerial acid.\u201d27 J.F. Meyer also postulated a\nuniversal acidum pingue a single acid, of which the other acids were later\nmodi\u0002cations, providing \u201can alternative explanation to that of Black of\nthe difference between mild and caustic (acidic) agents.\u201d28\nLavoisier himself was familiar with French translation of Meyer\u2019s]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=222\nPages: 222\nit and acids. These etymologies in his words were to \u201crelive the memories\nof beginners, who retain with dif\u0002culty a new word when it is absolutely\nempty of meaning.\u201d35 In his schema, salts were named in terms of the\nacids that they could become, and in his system he con\u0002dently named\n\u201ctwenty-two simple substances . . . not yet isolated, forming names from\nan individuating simple substance or radical and the relevant acid\u2014for\nexample\u2014\u201ccitric radical.\u201d36 The undiscovered bases of the undecomposed acids, he was sure would be readily uncovered now that the\nchemistry of oxygen was better understood. As he asserted,\nThat the number of the acids that one can form is again absolutely\nindeterminate, since one does not know all the substances that are likely\nto combine itself with the acidifying principle, and that one knows again\nless the means that one can employ to succeed in the combination.37\nIn this way, Lavoisier\u2019s nomenclature created a conceptual map to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=140\nPages: 140\nbulk of all living creatures including plants was ultimately water,\nthat water should be form\u2019d coagulated, and put on the shape of an Oak,\nAsh, etc., that is wholly ascribable to the intrinsick agents or intestine\nprinciples of Acid and Sulphur, set in the seedling into a Fermentative\nmotion, displayed into that \u0003gure by the manuduction and evolution\nof the contracted and shut up Seed, carried up and conveyed by their\nproper Vessels, whether by the names of veins, arteries, etc., with their\naccompanying Air Vessels according to . . . our countryman Dr. Grew.65\n61\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 121.\nSimpson, Zymologia Physica, p. 134.\n63\nOtto Tachenius, Hippocrates Chimicus (Venice, 1666), 90\u201391, as cited by Simpson,\nZymologia Chimicus, p. 135.

Hales believed that aerial acids\nand volatile salts contributed to the elasticity and \u0002xedness of the air,\nproduced or absorbed gases, and affected human respiration. We will\nalso examine Hales\u2019 Philosophical Experiments, a series of discourses about\nsurviving long voyages at sea (1739) in which he analyzes sea salts and\ntheir exhalations in the atmosphere.

Transact. Number 104) who assert\nthat vitriol can be made from actual common salt.76 That indeed may\nbe partially true, that is,\nPage 64\nto the extent to which that salt shares in the qualities of vitriol. By\nchance it is not so different from vitriol in its green color and what\none might call its sourness. But it is credible that this common salt is\nnot turned into true vitriol, but has borrowed from vitriol a certain\nghost-like similarity.\nIf however it be urged that when salts of several kinds are dissolved\nsimultaneously in the same water and dried out by heat they each]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=135\nPages: 135\nand acid also was important.

If water was added again to oil of vitriol, a violent Fermentation occurred, the exothermic reaction producing violent heat.41\nCognizant of past work which made extensive claims for the generative\npower of salts alone, Simpson was quite \u0003rm in denying that dry salts\nalone or those \u201cmixed and sublimed together\u201d would produce any fer-\n37]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128\nPages: 128\nthe nature of \u0003xed alkaline salts created by calcining plants was a\nresearch preoccupation of the Royal Society. Boyle also was involved\nin the classi\u0003cation of salts. As has been documented by Clericuzio,\nin his Usefulness of Experimental Naturall Philosophy (1663) Boyle classi\u0003ed\nsalts comprehensively and distinguished three types: acid, alkalizate or\nlixivial, and urinous or volatile. Principe and Newman have also demonstrated that Boyle drew a contrast between the Helmontian alkahest\nand \u201ccommon corrosive saline liquors\u201d or acids and alkalis.7 The liquors,\nderived from salts via distillation, deliquescence, lixiviation, and solution\nwere of three types: acid (such as nitric acid), urinous (ammonia and\nits salts), and alkalizates (\u0003xed alkalies such as potassium and sodium\ncarbonates). Boyle further derived a set of early \u201cPh\u201d indicators, such\nas syrup of violets to classify salts and their liquors into acid, urinous\nor lixivial types.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=215\nPages: 215\nwas adhering to the chymistry of Newton in the Opticks, in which the\nair was \u201cimpregnated with subtle sulphur,\u201d as well as with acids; in the\nDe Natura Acidorum, Newton also discoursed about the extreme attractive\nqualities and chymical reactivity of acids.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a continuation of the list of types of acids mentioned in the text, along with theories, chemical explanations, and page numbers:

7. <strong>Aerial Acid (Carbonic Acid / CO₂)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: <strong>Joseph Black</strong> and <strong>Torbern Bergman</strong> proposed that <strong>fixed air</strong> (carbon dioxide) was an acid gas that played a role in natural processes such as fermentation and respiration. Bergman later suggested renaming it as &quot;aerial acid.&quot;
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) forms when carbon dioxide dissolves in water. It plays a key role in biological processes, carbonation, and weathering of rocks.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 220](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220).

8. <strong>Nitrous Acid</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> theorized that <strong>nitrous acids</strong> could cause natural phenomena like thunderstorms and lightning. He believed that acid vapors were abundant in the air, promoting fermentation and combustion.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Nitrous acid (HNO₂) forms as an intermediate in the nitrogen cycle, contributing to the formation of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 143](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=143).

9. <strong>Spirit of Salt (Hydrochloric Acid / HCl)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Widely used in <strong>chymistry</strong> and metalwork. Early natural philosophers, including <strong>Boyle</strong>, classified it among <strong>corrosive saline liquors</strong> that could dissolve metals and catalyze chemical reactions.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid formed by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. It is crucial for industrial processes like metal refining and in the stomach for digestion.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 128](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=128).

10. <strong>Aluminous Acid</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Found in mineral springs, <strong>aluminous acid</strong> is believed to originate from alum-bearing ores. It was thought to contribute to the purification properties of mineral waters.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Aluminous acid, or aluminum sulphate (Al₂(SO₄)₃), forms acidic solutions that can coagulate impurities, used in water treatment and dyeing processes.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 264](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=264).

11. <strong>Sulphurous Acid</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Recognized for its role in <strong>fermentation</strong> and the transformation of vitriol into sulfuric acid. Early chemists like <strong>William Simpson</strong> described sulphurous acid as key to <strong>heat production</strong> in natural springs.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Sulphurous acid (H₂SO₃) is a weak acid formed by dissolving sulfur dioxide in water. It acts as a reducing agent and plays a role in industrial chemical processes.

Hales believed that aerial acids\nand volatile salts contributed to the elasticity and \u0002xedness of the air,\nproduced or absorbed gases, and affected human respiration. We will\nalso examine Hales\u2019 Philosophical Experiments, a series of discourses about\nsurviving long voyages at sea (1739) in which he analyzes sea salts and\ntheir exhalations in the atmosphere.

As Heinemann stated,\nHales considered that chemical processes were maintained by the production and absorption of gases by chemical substances, which he supposed\nbrought about by attractive and repulsive forces. Associating [free] \u201cair\u201d\nwith the alkali principle, he interpreted the interaction between acidic\nand alkaline substances in terms of the interactions between opposing\n[Newtonian] forces.10\nHales believed that the air lost its elasticity (decreased in volume) as the\nelastic particles of pure air were reabsorbed by the acid sulphureous\nfumes generated in the process.

Belief in the salt principle\ndiminished, and there was growing interest in the idea of a universal\nacid as the basic mover in processes of nature; it was usually identi\u0003ed\nas sulphuric acid.1 As Emerton has noted, in the seventeenth century,\nit was believed that acids or \u201csaline spirits\u201d were the most powerful\nchemical agents, and they were increasingly important in the chemical\nlaboratory as chemical reactions in solution predominated over older\ndistillation processes.2 The use of acids and alkalis in iatrochymical\ntreatments of Boerhaave and Franciscus Dele Bo\u00eb Sylvius (1614\u20131672),\nas well as Boyle\u2019s re\u0003nement of colored indicators in detecting acidity\nled to this shift in emphasis.\nAfter a brief contextual discussion of the rise of acids and alkalis\nin chemical and iatrochymical theory, we will start this chapter with a\ndiscussion of William Simpson.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a continuation of the list of types of acids mentioned in the text, along with theories, chemical explanations, and page numbers:

12. <strong>Acid of the Air (Atmospheric Acids)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Proposed by early pneumatic chemists, including <strong>Hales</strong> and <strong>Lavoisier</strong>, that atmospheric acids contributed to natural processes such as respiration, combustion, and weather phenomena like thunderstorms.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Atmospheric acids, including <strong>carbonic acid (H₂CO₃)</strong> and other gaseous acids like sulfur dioxide, were considered crucial to both respiration and chemical transformations in the air.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 219](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=219).

13. <strong>Aerial Acid (Carbon Dioxide)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: First recognized by <strong>Joseph Black</strong> as <strong>fixed air</strong> (carbon dioxide), later called <strong>aerial acid</strong> by <strong>Torbern Bergman</strong>. It was considered crucial to the process of <strong>acidification</strong> in both biological and chemical reactions.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) forms when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, playing a role in respiration, fermentation, and the carbonation of beverages.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 220](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=220).

14. <strong>Acid of Vitriol (Sulphuric Acid)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Considered by <strong>George Stahl</strong> and other chemists as the <strong>universal acid</strong>, essential in natural processes like mineral formation and weathering. <strong>Sulphuric acid</strong> was the primary agent responsible for the <strong>acidification of materials</strong>.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong mineral acid used in the production of fertilizers, chemicals, and refining of metals. It is highly corrosive and generates heat when mixed with water.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 125](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=125).

15. <strong>Nitrous Acid (Nitric Acid Derivative)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Suggested by <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> as a possible cause of <strong>thunderstorms</strong> and <strong>lightning</strong>, based on the presence of nitrous vapors in the air. Newton associated nitrous acid with <strong>fermentation</strong> and chemical reactions that produced heat and light.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Nitrous acid (HNO₂) is a weak and unstable acid formed from nitrogen dioxide. It plays a role in the nitrogen cycle and atmospheric chemistry.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 143](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=143).

16. <strong>Aluminous Acid</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Found in alum-rich minerals, <strong>aluminous acid</strong> was believed to contribute to the medicinal properties of mineral springs and the <strong>purification of water</strong>.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Aluminous acid is derived from aluminum salts, particularly <strong>aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃)</strong>, used in water purification, dyeing, and tanning processes.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 264](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=264).

This led\nhim to conclude that in \u201cmost Plants, the Preadominant Principle is\nan Acid,\u201d particularly in the parenchyma, whereas animal substances\ncontained more alkalis.193 Grew also argued that plants contained\nsulphur, especially in the wood, as there was a large amount of resinous sap in the wood\u2019s lympheducts, the sap having the same oily and\n\u0002ammable properties of sulphureous substances. He then performed a\nseries of experiments in which he dropped the alkali spirit of hartshorn\n(aqueous solution of ammonia) or sal ammoniac on tinctures of \u0002owers and on leaves.

Tachenius in his Hippocrates\nChimicus (1666) claimed that no fermentation, creation or decay of\nanimals and plants could occur without acids.63 Olaus Borrichius in his\nDe Hermetica Aegyptiorum vetere et Paracelsiorum Nova Medicina (Helmstadt,\n1648), likewise stated that acids and sulphurs formed an intrinsic part\nof all animals.\nAcids were thus claimed to be differently composed to make up the\nmodi\u0003cations of bodies, and classi\u0003ed as actively fermenting and \u0002uid,\nor passive and consistent of matter: \u201cFrom which succlency of Acids\ntogether with intermediate coagulations and hardenings, perform\u2019d at\ndue seasons, all concrete bodies in the threefold Kingdoms of nature are\nproduc\u2019d.\u201d64 As an example, Simpson showed how acids and sulphurs\naccounted for plant growth.

As he later rather cynically advised another young physician,\nTimothy Vanbustle:\nShould you have an itching to make your name known by writing a book\non physic, yet so customary, I will advise you to choose the subject by\nwhich you think you will get most money, or that will bring you the most]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=143\nPages: 143\nnitrous acids, and sometimes taking \u0003re cause lightening and thunder,\nand \u0003ery meteors.

As Heinemann stated,\nHales considered that chemical processes were maintained by the production and absorption of gases by chemical substances, which he supposed\nbrought about by attractive and repulsive forces. Associating [free] \u201cair\u201d\nwith the alkali principle, he interpreted the interaction between acidic\nand alkaline substances in terms of the interactions between opposing\n[Newtonian] forces.10\nHales believed that the air lost its elasticity (decreased in volume) as the\nelastic particles of pure air were reabsorbed by the acid sulphureous\nfumes generated in the process.

Hales believed that aerial acids\nand volatile salts contributed to the elasticity and \u0002xedness of the air,\nproduced or absorbed gases, and affected human respiration. We will\nalso examine Hales\u2019 Philosophical Experiments, a series of discourses about\nsurviving long voyages at sea (1739) in which he analyzes sea salts and\ntheir exhalations in the atmosphere.

Principe and Newman have also demonstrated that Boyle drew a contrast between the Helmontian alkahest\nand \u201ccommon corrosive saline liquors\u201d or acids and alkalis.7 The liquors,\nderived from salts via distillation, deliquescence, lixiviation, and solution\nwere of three types: acid (such as nitric acid), urinous (ammonia and\nits salts), and alkalizates (\u0003xed alkalies such as potassium and sodium\ncarbonates). Boyle further derived a set of early \u201cPh\u201d indicators, such\nas syrup of violets to classify salts and their liquors into acid, urinous\nor lixivial types.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=168\nPages: 168,167\n173\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 303\u2013304.\n174\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 304.\n175\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 304.\n176\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 343.\n177\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, p. 305.\n178\nRobinson, Animal Oeconomy, pp. 305\u2013306.\nfrom salts to saline spirits\n151\na constant supply of this acid by means of respiration.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is the continuation of the list of types of acids mentioned in the text, along with their theories, chemical explanations, and page numbers:

17. <strong>Acid of Pyrites (Sulfuric Acid from Pyrites)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Recognized in mineral springs and baths, sulfuric acid generated from <strong>pyrites</strong> (iron sulfide) was believed to be the main agent responsible for the <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>heat</strong> in these springs.  
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) forms through the natural oxidation of pyrites, releasing sulfur compounds into the water. It was a critical agent in creating acidic environments in geological formations.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 264](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=264).

18. <strong>Aerial Acid (Atmospheric Acidic Particles)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Early natural philosophers such as <strong>Stephen Hales</strong> and <strong>Bryan Robinson</strong> suggested that the air was filled with <strong>acidic particles</strong>, which contributed to processes like <strong>fermentation</strong>, <strong>lightning</strong>, and <strong>thunder</strong>. Robinson proposed that these particles strengthened fibers and other materials.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Aerial acids likely included <strong>carbonic acid</strong> (H₂CO₃) and other acidic gases, which were believed to react with water in the atmosphere to influence weather and biological processes.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 167](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=167).

19. <strong>Oil of Vitriol (Sulfuric Acid)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Commonly referred to in early chymistry, <strong>oil of vitriol</strong> was a strong acid used for <strong>distillation</strong> and <strong>chemical reactions</strong>. It was central to the understanding of acidic properties in nature.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), produced through the distillation of vitriolic minerals like green vitriol (ferrous sulfate), was widely used in early chemical processes, such as metalworking and alchemy.
   - <strong>Page Reference</strong>: [Page 135](https://myaidrive.com/3Mu6jt4M3ytikcyGSo9FkJ/_History-of-.pdf?pdfPage=135).

20. <strong>Acidum Pingue (Fatty Acid)</strong>  
   - <strong>Theory</strong>: Proposed by <strong>J.F. Meyer</strong>, the <strong>fatty acid</strong> theory suggested that all acids were <strong>modifications</strong> of a fundamental <strong>fatty acid</strong>, responsible for various acidic reactions in natural processes. This concept provided an alternative to the dominant <strong>Lavoisier’s oxygen theory</strong> of acids.
   - <strong>Explanation</strong>: Fatty acids (R-COOH) are carboxylic acids found in fats and oils, contributing to both biological functions and chemical reactions, particularly in organic chemistry.

<strong>Host (Voiceover):</strong>
Welcome, fellow occultists, artists, stoners, and scholars! Today, we’re diving into a book that makes the philosophical and chemical transformation from <strong>alchemy</strong> to <strong>modern chemistry</strong> not only accessible but fascinating for the most dedicated among us. If you’ve ever wondered how the ancient pursuit of transmutation and elixirs evolved into the scientific method, this is a review you won’t want to miss. So light your incense, grab your favorite beverage, and let’s delve into *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry&quot;*—a work that traces this intellectual journey.

[Cut to the host holding the book.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
This book brilliantly unpacks the evolution of <strong>alchemy</strong> into <strong>chemistry</strong> by focusing on key figures—visionaries like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Johann Glauber</strong>, and yes, even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>. It’s a book that reveals just how deeply entwined esoteric thinking was with the development of science. It’s perfect for those who already have one foot in the world of ancient wisdom and the other in the modern rational mindset.

Now, for those of you wondering whether this book makes the transition from <strong>alchemy</strong> to <strong>chemistry</strong> accessible—let me just say that it succeeds in showing how ancient alchemists weren’t just mystics. They were serious experimenters. Alchemy wasn’t some kind of pseudoscience; it was an earnest attempt to understand matter, life, and even the divine. The thinkers we’ll discuss in this review were the ones who bridged the mystical and material, paving the way for modern chemistry.

[Cut to image of Paracelsus, with smoky animations around him.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Let’s start with <strong>Paracelsus</strong> (1493–1541). This man is the ultimate alchemist-rebel. In his time, alchemy was deeply rooted in mysticism, but Paracelsus wasn’t content with just the spiritual and symbolic meanings of transformation. He redefined alchemy’s goals. While medieval alchemy often focused on creating the philosopher’s stone to turn lead into gold, Paracelsus was more concerned with <strong>practical healing</strong>.

The book dedicates a significant portion to <strong>Paracelsus’s adaptation of alchemical principles</strong>. In particular, he introduced the idea of <strong>tria prima</strong>—three foundational elements: <strong>sulfur</strong>, <strong>mercury</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong>. The trinity was used to explain everything from metals to human health. Sulfur represented combustibility and the soul, mercury symbolized volatility and the spirit, and salt was the element of solidity, representing the material body.

For Paracelsus, <strong>salt</strong> wasn’t just a substance—it was the <strong>principle of stability</strong> in both nature and the human body. He expanded the dualistic framework of alchemy, which traditionally focused on sulfur and mercury, by adding salt as a third element that explained physical health and disease. This wasn’t some symbolic flourish; Paracelsus thought that diseases could be cured by <strong>chemical processes</strong>. In a way, he laid the foundations for what we now call <strong>iatrochemistry</strong>—chemical medicine.

<strong>Host (voiceover, with images of old alchemical texts):</strong>
What makes the book’s treatment of Paracelsus exciting for both <strong>occultists</strong> and <strong>scholars of religious studies</strong> is how it shows Paracelsus walking the line between the mystical and the practical. His <strong>tria prima</strong> is more than just esoteric symbolism—it’s a precursor to modern concepts of chemical reactions, especially how we think about elements and compounds today.

---

[Cut to image of Van Helmont, with alchemical symbols floating.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Moving on, we come to <strong>Johann Baptista Van Helmont</strong> (1580–1644). Now, Van Helmont is a thinker who pushed the theory of <strong>salt</strong> into fascinating new territory. The book shows how Van Helmont’s work built on Paracelsus’s ideas, but he took a more experimental approach, bringing us closer to the empirical methods of modern science.

Van Helmont’s major contribution was his study of <strong>gases</strong>—or as he called them, “wild spirits” or <strong>&quot;gases sylvestres&quot;</strong>. He was among the first to identify what we now know as <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>. But here’s where salt comes in. For Van Helmont, <strong>salt</strong> wasn’t just a chemical compound, it was <strong>volatile</strong>—it could <strong>transform</strong>, <strong>sublimate</strong>, and <strong>dissolve</strong> in ways that were both physical and spiritual.

Van Helmont believed that the body&#x27;s balance of salts and gases determined health. His experiments on fermentation and digestion led him to propose that <strong>salt played a key role in these processes</strong>. He moved away from the metaphysical and showed that <strong>chemical reactions</strong> were at the core of both bodily and environmental transformations. This book details how he started shifting alchemical theory from a purely symbolic language to an early form of <strong>biochemistry</strong>.

What’s really cool is how the book traces Van Helmont’s <strong>experiments</strong> with gases and salts and connects them to the early understanding of <strong>chemical reactions</strong>, something every chemistry student today can appreciate.

[Cut to image of Johann Glauber, with swirling vials of liquid.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Next up, we’ve got <strong>Johann Glauber</strong> (1604–1670), the <strong>alchemist-turned-industrialist</strong>. If you’re an artist or a stoner who’s into strange chemical concoctions, this guy’s story will fascinate you.

Glauber discovered <strong>sodium sulfate</strong>, which he called <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong>. But what’s amazing about Glauber is how he bridged the mystical world of alchemy with the growing commercial world of <strong>chymistry</strong>. This book explains how Glauber’s <strong>alchemy</strong> wasn’t about making gold—it was about creating practical chemicals that could be used in medicine, agriculture, and industry.

He was also one of the first to propose using chemical processes for large-scale production. In many ways, Glauber’s work foreshadowed modern <strong>chemical engineering</strong>. The book emphasizes how his practical approach to <strong>salts and acids</strong> represents the true shift from <strong>alchemy</strong> to <strong>industrial chemistry</strong>.

For Glauber, <strong>salts</strong> weren’t just spiritually transformative—they were economically valuable. The book portrays Glauber as one of the key figures in transitioning alchemy from the realm of the esoteric to the <strong>laboratory</strong> and <strong>marketplace</strong>.

[Cut to Isaac Newton’s image, surrounded by astronomical symbols.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
And finally, let’s talk about <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> (1642–1727). Yes, the same guy who gave us the laws of motion was deeply into <strong>alchemy</strong>. The book doesn’t shy away from Newton’s obsession with <strong>alchemy</strong>, especially his work on <strong>De Natura Acidorum</strong> or “On the Nature of Acids.”

Newton’s work on <strong>acids</strong> and <strong>sulphur</strong> is covered in detail. He believed that <strong>acids</strong> were some of the most powerful forces in nature, capable of breaking down substances and creating new ones. What’s interesting is that Newton saw acids as the key to understanding both <strong>chemical reactions</strong> and <strong>cosmic forces</strong>. This fusion of <strong>physical science</strong> and <strong>alchemy</strong> is where Newton’s genius really shines. He believed that the same forces governing celestial bodies were also present in <strong>chemical transformations</strong>.

The book reveals that, for Newton, <strong>alchemy wasn’t just a fringe interest</strong>—it was integral to his scientific thinking. His work on <strong>optics</strong> and <strong>gravity</strong> was deeply informed by his alchemical research into <strong>acids</strong>, and this book does an incredible job of showing just how connected those worlds were.

[Opening Scene: Dimly lit, scholarly setting with a backdrop of old books and chemical glassware. The host sits in front of the table, an open book in front of them.]

<strong>Host (serious, calm tone):</strong>
There is a moment in the history of science when the ancient practice of alchemy begins to shift, to fragment and transform into something new—<strong>modern chemistry</strong>. This wasn’t a sudden break but a complex evolution where esoteric, symbolic practices intertwined with empirical experimentation. Some of the greatest minds of early modern Europe—names we know well and some we do not—carried the torch of <strong>alchemy</strong> into the age of <strong>scientific inquiry</strong>.

This book, *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,&quot;* captures that transition. It invites the reader into a time when philosophers, physicians, and alchemists were asking the most profound questions about the nature of matter, life, and the cosmos—questions that were as spiritual as they were scientific.

In this review, we’ll explore how this book succeeds in making the shift from alchemy to chemistry <strong>comprehensible</strong> and <strong>fascinating</strong>. We’ll look closely at the work of <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Johann Glauber</strong>, and even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>—figures who straddled two worlds, balancing mystical traditions with the emerging rigor of scientific method.

<strong>Host:</strong>
This is not a casual read, but for the dedicated thinker, it offers rich insights into how <strong>early modern science</strong> was shaped by alchemy’s <strong>transformative ambitions</strong>. The authors of this book carefully trace how each thinker contributed to the development of <strong>modern chemical principles</strong>, while still deeply influenced by the <strong>mystical</strong> and <strong>esoteric traditions</strong> of alchemy.

Let’s begin with <strong>Paracelsus</strong>.

---

[Cut to image of Paracelsus, with minimal animations for a scholarly tone.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Paracelsus (1493–1541) is one of the most critical figures in this narrative. While many alchemists of his time were still focused on the <strong>philosopher’s stone</strong> and the transmutation of metals, Paracelsus redirected alchemical practice toward <strong>medicine</strong>. His theory of the <strong>tria prima</strong>—the three fundamental substances of <strong>sulfur</strong>, <strong>mercury</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong>—was revolutionary. He argued that these three elements underpinned not just the structure of metals but also the health of the human body.

The book explores how <strong>Paracelsus’s adaptation of alchemical principles</strong> marked a critical turning point. He introduced <strong>salt</strong> as a stabilizing force—representing the physical body, the material world. In contrast, sulfur was the principle of transformation, and mercury embodied volatility. For Paracelsus, <strong>disease</strong> was a result of imbalances in these substances, and the task of the physician-alchemist was to restore this balance through <strong>chemical treatments</strong>.

This wasn’t alchemy as a symbolic or mystical endeavor—it was <strong>alchemy as practical science</strong>, edging toward what we now recognize as <strong>chemistry</strong>. The book makes it clear that Paracelsus’s work laid the groundwork for what would later become <strong>iatrochemistry</strong>—the chemical study of medicine.

---

[Cut to an image of Van Helmont, surrounded by experimental apparatus.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
From Paracelsus, the book moves seamlessly to <strong>Johann Baptista Van Helmont</strong> (1580–1644), another pivotal figure in the transition. Van Helmont was the first to introduce the concept of <strong>gases</strong> into chemical theory, long before the discovery of oxygen or hydrogen. He referred to these substances as <strong>&quot;wild spirits&quot;</strong>, or <strong>&quot;gas sylvestre,&quot;</strong> recognizing that these were essential to processes like <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>digestion</strong>.

His contributions to the <strong>theory of salt</strong> were equally transformative. Building on Paracelsian ideas, Van Helmont believed that salts were volatile and dynamic. For him, salts weren’t merely static compounds but <strong>active agents</strong> in both the natural world and the human body. His research into how gases and salts interacted helped dismantle some of the more mystical components of alchemical thought, moving it closer to the <strong>empirical framework</strong> that modern chemistry would adopt.

The book excels in highlighting how Van Helmont’s method—careful, observational, and experimental—played a key role in bridging <strong>alchemy’s esoteric philosophy</strong> with the emerging scientific method.

The narrative continues with <strong>Johann Glauber</strong> (1604–1670), a figure who is often overshadowed by the giants of science but who made substantial contributions to the development of chemical processes. <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong>, or <strong>sodium sulfate</strong>, was just one of his discoveries,</div>

### <strong>Introduction 1: Highly Academic, Dense with Science Vocabulary</strong>

In the early modern period, the boundaries between <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> were far less distinct than they appear today. Alchemists sought not only to transmute metals but also to uncover the deeper, hidden properties of matter—work that laid the foundations for modern chemical science. In the book *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,&quot;* we witness the gradual disentanglement of the <strong>esoteric metaphysics</strong> of alchemy from the <strong>empirical methodologies</strong> of chemistry. Through the work of <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Glauber</strong>, and <strong>Newton</strong>, this text provides a thorough analysis of how chemical principles emerged from centuries of alchemical speculation. For the committed reader, this book makes the <strong>epistemological shift</strong> from <strong>hermetic mysticism</strong> to the experimental rigor of chemistry not only clear but deeply engaging.

---

### <strong>Introduction 2: Serious, Scholarly, Moderate Science Vocabulary</strong>

The evolution of <strong>alchemy</strong> into <strong>chemistry</strong> is one of the most fascinating transformations in intellectual history. What began as a mystical and often secretive pursuit to understand the nature of matter gradually developed into a scientific discipline with standardized methods and theories. In *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,&quot;* the authors chart this progression through the lives and works of figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Glauber</strong>, and <strong>Newton</strong>.

[Opening Scene: Host sits in front of a mystical, psychedelic backdrop—think swirling lights, bookshelves with alchemical symbols, and candles. The atmosphere is calm, slightly trippy, but intellectual.]

<strong>Host (voiceover, calm yet enthusiastic tone):</strong>
You know, one of the most mind-expanding things we can do is look at how the lines between <strong>science</strong> and <strong>mysticism</strong> have blurred throughout history. The deeper you dive into the roots of modern science—especially <strong>chemistry</strong>—the more you realize it’s not just a dry, empirical discipline. It’s born from <strong>alchemy</strong>, a practice that was as spiritual as it was experimental. And that’s what we’re going to explore today with *“The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,”* a book that shows just how closely intertwined these two worlds once were.

Now, I know you’re thinking—<strong>alchemy?</strong> Isn&#x27;t that just medieval woo-woo stuff about turning lead into gold? Well, not quite. Alchemy wasn’t just about material transformation; it was about <strong>transforming consciousness</strong>, expanding one’s understanding of reality. The same thinkers who were seeking the <strong>philosopher&#x27;s stone</strong> were also laying the groundwork for what would become modern science. And reading this book is like taking a trip into that mindspace where the <strong>mystical</strong> and the <strong>scientific</strong> weren’t separate at all.

---

[Cut to the host holding the book with a knowing smile.]

<strong>Host (direct to camera):</strong>
This book is a total trip, because it shows how <strong>chemistry</strong>, as we know it, grew directly out of alchemy’s <strong>philosophical and spiritual quests</strong>. And what’s wild is that people like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Glauber</strong>, and even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>—yeah, the Newton you learned about in school—were all about exploring the <strong>hidden properties of matter</strong>, but also the deeper <strong>metaphysical dimensions</strong> of reality.

Let me tell you why studying the mystical background of chemistry is so mind-opening.

---

[Cut to an image of Paracelsus, with swirling mystical symbols.]

<strong>Host (voiceover):</strong>
Let’s start with <strong>Paracelsus</strong>. He’s a figure that really makes you rethink what alchemy was all about. Paracelsus didn’t see <strong>sulfur</strong>, <strong>mercury</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong> as just substances you could hold in your hand—they were <strong>spiritual archetypes</strong> that represented <strong>body, soul, and spirit</strong>. His idea of the <strong>tria prima</strong> wasn’t just about turning lead into gold; it was about understanding the <strong>inner alchemy</strong> of healing the human body.

In this book, Paracelsus comes across as someone who saw nature as a <strong>living, breathing organism</strong>—he treated the <strong>material world</strong> as intimately connected to the <strong>spiritual</strong>. What’s more, he took that worldview and applied it to actual medical practice. The dude was synthesizing <strong>medicine and mysticism</strong> in ways that would blow your mind today.

This book explains how Paracelsus didn’t just play with the symbolic side of alchemy. He was doing <strong>real science</strong>, testing out chemical compounds to heal people. His work forms the basis of <strong>iatrochemistry</strong>—the early form of <strong>chemical medicine</strong>—showing that alchemy was already transforming into chemistry, but it was still bathed in this intense <strong>spiritual philosophy</strong>.

---

[Cut to an image of Van Helmont, with abstract gas-like animations flowing around him.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Now, Paracelsus was just the beginning. <strong>Johann Baptista Van Helmont</strong> took these ideas to a whole new level. This guy was deep into the <strong>study of gases</strong>—he’s the one who coined the term “<strong>gas sylvestre</strong>,” which we now call <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>. But he didn’t just see gases as physical substances; he saw them as <strong>wild spirits</strong>—as mystical forces that shape reality.

What’s incredible about Van Helmont’s story in this book is how it captures his idea that <strong>salts and gases</strong> were part of the <strong>living matrix of nature</strong>. For him, salt wasn’t just something you sprinkled on your food—it was a vital <strong>spiritual and chemical force</strong> that could dissolve and transform matter. He experimented with these ideas like a true scientist, but with a mind tuned into the <strong>hidden energies</strong> of the world.

In reading this book, you’ll see how Van Helmont started to make alchemy a little more empirical, moving it toward what we’d now call <strong>chemistry</strong>. But he never let go of the idea that these forces had deeper, almost <strong>cosmic significance</strong>. It’s a perfect example of how <strong>science and mysticism</strong> were one and the same at that point in history.

---

[Cut to an image of Glauber, with industrial-style beakers and smoke swirling.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Then we get to <strong>Johann Glauber</strong>—this is where alchemy starts getting really grounded in the material world. Glauber was like an <strong>industrial alchemist</strong>—a practical guy who took the spiritual ideas of alchemy and turned them into <strong>real-world chemical processes</strong>. He discovered <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong> (which is sodium sulfate) and used it for everything from medicine to agriculture. It’s like he was foreshadowing modern industrial chemistry, but his work was still full of <strong>alchemy’s transformative mystique</strong>.

The book dives into how Glauber saw <strong>salts and acids</strong> not just as chemical substances, but as <strong>spiritual agents of change</strong>. He believed that they were essential for the regeneration of matter and life. It’s so trippy to realize that as he was doing these practical, repeatable experiments, he was also deeply tuned into the <strong>philosophical and spiritual</strong> meaning of his work.

---

[Cut to an image of Isaac Newton, with subtle celestial and alchemical symbols surrounding him.]

<strong>Host:</strong>
Now, here’s the real kicker. We all know <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> for his discoveries in physics—<strong>gravity</strong>, <strong>optics</strong>, the whole deal. But what you don’t often hear about is Newton’s obsession with <strong>alchemy</strong>. He was deep into the study of <strong>De Natura Acidorum</strong>, or &quot;On the Nature of Acids,&quot; and he believed that <strong>acids</strong> were the key to understanding the <strong>universe</strong>.

This book goes into Newton’s alchemical side and shows how he didn’t separate his scientific work from his <strong>mystical beliefs</strong>. He thought the same <strong>principles governing the planets</strong> also governed chemical reactions. That’s right—Newton was out here thinking that acids weren’t just chemicals; they were manifestations of <strong>universal laws</strong>. When you read about this in the book, you realize that Newton’s breakthroughs in physics were intimately connected to his experiments with alchemy. The divide between <strong>science</strong> and <strong>spirituality</strong> didn’t exist for him, and that’s something we can learn from today.

<strong>Host:</strong>
So, if you want to expand your mind and dive into the mystical roots of modern science, *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry&quot;* is a journey worth taking. It’s not just about how <strong>alchemy turned into chemistry</strong>—it’s about how <strong>science was born</strong> from a worldview that saw <strong>matter and spirit</strong> as one. Reading this book will challenge the way you think about reality and remind you that today’s science came from some truly <strong>mystical places</strong>.

<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>Explain how Paracelsus&#x27;s ideas about philosophical mercury and the spirits of the metals were the basis of serious theorization and experimentation about matter in an academic style essay</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### The Theoretical Foundations of Paracelsus’s Concept of Philosophical Mercury and the Spirits of Metals

The Swiss physician and alchemist <strong>Paracelsus (1493–1541)</strong> revolutionized early modern scientific thought by advancing a theory of matter that integrated the metaphysical with empirical experimentation. Central to Paracelsus’s framework was his concept of <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong>, which served as both symbolic and practical elements in his exploration of the material world. These ideas, rooted in medieval alchemical traditions, were repurposed by Paracelsus to form the basis of a proto-chemical theory that linked the physical properties of metals with spiritual and vital forces. His emphasis on the role of philosophical mercury in the transformation of matter, as well as the corresponding spirits governing metals, led to serious theorization and experimentation regarding the nature of material substances, laying the groundwork for what would later evolve into more empirical approaches in chemistry.

#### Philosophical Mercury: The Quintessential Element of Matter

<strong>Philosophical mercury</strong>, in Paracelsian thought, represented a <strong>universal principle of volatility and transformation</strong>. In contrast to the physical mercury (quicksilver) known to his contemporaries, philosophical mercury was considered a subtle, spiritualized essence that animated matter. Paracelsus viewed it as a critical component of his broader theory of the <strong>tria prima</strong>, in which mercury, along with <strong>sulfur</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>, constituted the three fundamental elements of nature. Each of these substances corresponded to different aspects of existence: sulfur symbolized the soul and combustibility, salt embodied the body and stability, and mercury represented the spirit or fluid essence that enabled change and transmutation.

Paracelsus’s notion of philosophical mercury drew on the ancient alchemical tradition that had long held mercury to be one of the two primary substances, alongside sulfur, in the transmutation of metals. However, Paracelsus extended this idea beyond the symbolic and speculative realms. He argued that philosophical mercury was not merely a mystical principle but an actual force underlying <strong>natural processes of transformation</strong>. According to Paracelsus, mercury’s volatility made it the agent responsible for the mutability of matter, and by manipulating this spiritual essence, one could alter the physical properties of metals.

In his writings, Paracelsus theorized that all metals contain an inner spirit, and mercury was the key to unlocking this hidden force. In this sense, <strong>mercury functioned both symbolically and practically</strong> as the intermediary between the physical body of a substance and its underlying spiritual essence. This duality allowed Paracelsus to develop a model in which the philosophical mercury could be activated or manipulated through alchemical processes to effect material change. Thus, mercury was not only the means of transforming base metals into gold, the long-held goal of alchemical transmutation, but also of purifying and refining matter in a more general sense.

#### The Spirits of Metals: A Bridge Between Material and Spiritual Realms

Paracelsus’s <strong>spirits of metals</strong> were an extension of his theory of mercury and reflected his belief that all material substances were animated by spiritual forces. According to his theory, each metal contained an <strong>intrinsic spirit</strong>, which governed its form, behavior, and interaction with other substances. For Paracelsus, the study of these spirits was not merely speculative; it was a crucial part of his empirical investigation into the properties of metals.

Each metal&#x27;s spirit was tied to its <strong>philosophical mercury</strong>, which Paracelsus believed could be liberated through alchemical processes. By refining metals or subjecting them to heat and dissolution, the spirit of the metal would be released, allowing for its transformation. This framework, while metaphysical in nature, led Paracelsus and his followers to conduct <strong>practical experiments</strong> aimed at understanding the chemical behaviors of different metals and their capacities for transformation.

The spirits of metals were believed to explain phenomena such as the <strong>fusibility</strong> and <strong>malleability</strong> of certain substances. For instance, Paracelsus posited that gold’s resistance to corrosion and its permanence reflected the stability of its internal spirit, while more mutable metals like lead and tin had spirits that were less fixed, thus more prone to change. This spirit-matter relationship was not merely symbolic but was thought to have direct implications for the <strong>physical properties</strong> and <strong>alchemical manipulation</strong> of substances.

#### The Theoretical and Experimental Implications

Paracelsus’s ideas about philosophical mercury and the spirits of metals laid the foundation for a <strong>theory of matter</strong> that combined <strong>mystical philosophy</strong> with <strong>empirical observation</strong>. His emphasis on the <strong>transformative potential</strong> of mercury led to practical experiments in which alchemists sought to isolate and manipulate the mercurial essence of metals to achieve transmutation or purification. This involved processes such as <strong>distillation</strong>, <strong>calcination</strong>, and <strong>sublimation</strong>, all aimed at separating the spiritual essence (mercury) from the physical body of a substance and then recombining them in novel forms.

While Paracelsus’s theories were steeped in <strong>alchemical symbolism</strong>, his approach had real-world applications, particularly in the field of <strong>medicine</strong>. His emphasis on the relationship between spiritual and material forces led him to develop chemical remedies based on the purification and transformation of substances. By isolating and refining the mercurial and sulfuric essences of certain metals and minerals, Paracelsus believed that one could create powerful medicines capable of curing diseases rooted in imbalances of the <strong>tria prima</strong> within the human body.

This blending of <strong>theoretical speculation</strong> and <strong>practical experimentation</strong> marks Paracelsus’s contribution to the <strong>transition from alchemy to chemistry</strong>. His work influenced subsequent generations of alchemists and natural philosophers, many of whom adopted his ideas about the <strong>elemental spirits</strong> of metals while also pursuing more systematic and empirical approaches to their study. Over time, the mystical aspects of Paracelsus’s theory would be eclipsed by the development of modern chemistry, which increasingly focused on the <strong>material properties</strong> of substances and the laws governing chemical reactions. Nonetheless, Paracelsus’s vision of mercury as a <strong>dynamic, spiritual force</strong> was a key precursor to the chemical theories that would emerge in the 17th and 18th centuries.

#### Conclusion

Paracelsus’s concepts of <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong> were instrumental in shaping early modern theories of matter. By integrating metaphysical principles with empirical experimentation, he provided a framework through which alchemists could explore the <strong>transformative powers of nature</strong>. His ideas not only influenced the course of alchemy but also laid the intellectual groundwork for the eventual development of <strong>modern chemistry</strong>. Through his synthesis of spiritual and material perspectives, Paracelsus offered a unique and enduring vision of the <strong>relationship between matter and spirit</strong>, one that continues to resonate in the study of the history of science and philosophy.</div>

In the early modern period, the boundaries between <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> were far more fluid than they are today. Alchemy was not simply a mystical quest for transmutation but a serious investigation into the nature of matter, one that wove together spiritual principles and empirical experimentation. <strong>Paracelsus (1493–1541)</strong> was a central figure in this intellectual landscape, introducing concepts like <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong>, which merged the material with the metaphysical. These ideas were not merely speculative but served as the foundation for serious theorization and experimentation regarding matter. Through Paracelsus’s vision, alchemy became a means of understanding both the <strong>spiritual properties</strong> and <strong>physical behaviors</strong> of substances, forming the basis for what would eventually</div>

<strong>Host (voiceover, calm yet enthusiastic tone):</strong>  
You know, one of the most mind-expanding things we can do is look at how the lines between <strong>science</strong> and <strong>mysticism</strong> have blurred throughout history. The deeper you dive into the roots of modern science—especially <strong>chemistry</strong>—the more you realize it’s not just a dry, empirical discipline. It’s born from <strong>alchemy</strong>, a practice that was as spiritual as it was experimental. And that’s what we’re going to explore today with *“The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,”* a book that shows just how closely intertwined these two worlds once were.

Now, I know you’re thinking—<strong>alchemy?</strong> Isn&#x27;t that just medieval woo-woo stuff about turning lead into gold? Well, not quite. Alchemy wasn’t just about material transformation; it was about <strong>transforming consciousness</strong>, expanding one’s understanding of reality. The same thinkers who were seeking the <strong>philosopher&#x27;s stone</strong> were also laying the groundwork for what would become modern science. And reading this book is like taking a trip into that mindspace where the <strong>mystical</strong> and the <strong>scientific</strong> weren’t separate at all.

---

[Cut to the host holding the book with a knowing smile.]

<strong>Host (direct to camera):</strong>  
This book is a total trip, because it shows how <strong>chemistry</strong>, as we know it, grew directly out of alchemy’s <strong>philosophical and spiritual quests</strong>. And what’s wild is that people like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Glauber</strong>, and even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>—yeah, the Newton you learned about in school—were all exploring <strong>matter</strong> not just as a physical substance, but as something imbued with <strong>spirit</strong>. They were experimenting with <strong>real chemicals</strong>, sure, but they were also tuned into the <strong>hidden, spiritual forces</strong> behind those chemicals.

One of the most fascinating ideas in this book is Paracelsus’s theory of <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong>. It wasn’t just about studying <strong>mercury</strong>, <strong>sulfur</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong> as basic elements—it was about seeing them as <strong>vital forces</strong> that animated all of nature. This takes our understanding of alchemy to a whole new level. Let me explain.

---

[Cut to an image of Paracelsus, with swirling mystical symbols.]

<strong>Host (voiceover):</strong>  
For <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> was this ultimate, volatile essence that could transform not just metals but the human soul. It was more than a substance—it was a <strong>spiritual force</strong>. Along with <strong>sulfur</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>, philosophical mercury formed part of what he called the <strong>tria prima</strong>, the three fundamental principles of life and matter.

But here’s the kicker—<strong>philosophical mercury</strong> wasn’t just symbolic. Paracelsus believed it was a <strong>real force</strong> that could be manipulated through <strong>alchemical experiments</strong>. He thought it could be <strong>activated</strong>, not just for turning base metals into gold, but for <strong>healing</strong> and even <strong>transforming the human body</strong>. He was blending <strong>spiritual theory</strong> with <strong>practical chemistry</strong>, and that’s what makes his ideas so intriguing. His concept of mercury wasn’t just about changing matter—it was about unlocking the <strong>spiritual potential</strong> within matter.

The book makes it clear that Paracelsus’s experiments with <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> weren’t just esoteric—they were the basis of real <strong>scientific theorization</strong> about matter, laying the foundation for chemistry. And he didn’t stop with mercury. He believed that every metal had its own <strong>spirit</strong>, something that governed its properties and could be harnessed through <strong>alchemy</strong>.

---

[Cut to an image of Van Helmont, with abstract gas-like animations flowing around him.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
From there, the book introduces us to <strong>Johann Baptista Van Helmont</strong>, a thinker who took these ideas even further. For Van Helmont, it wasn’t just about the <strong>spirits of metals</strong>—he believed that all substances had a kind of living essence. He introduced the idea of <strong>&quot;gas sylvestre&quot;</strong>, which we now know as <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>, but to him, it was a <strong>wild spirit</strong>. He saw gases and salts as <strong>spiritual forces</strong> that shaped the physical world.

Here’s the part that really resonates with Paracelsus’s work: Van Helmont believed that <strong>salt</strong> wasn’t just a mineral—it was a <strong>transformative spirit</strong> that could dissolve and reconstitute matter. The <strong>spirits of metals</strong> and <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> were, to him, real, powerful forces that could <strong>change</strong> substances from the inside out. His ideas laid the groundwork for how we now understand <strong>chemical reactions</strong>, but he never lost sight of their deeper, almost <strong>cosmic significance</strong>.

---

[Cut to an image of Glauber, with industrial-style beakers and smoke swirling.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
Then we get to <strong>Johann Glauber</strong>, and you can see this <strong>alchemy-into-chemistry</strong> shift even more clearly. Glauber was all about finding the <strong>spiritual significance</strong> in practical substances like <strong>sodium sulfate</strong>, which he discovered and named <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong>. But the crazy part is, even though he was focused on industrial applications, he still believed in the <strong>spiritual force of salts</strong> and acids. To Glauber, chemical reactions weren’t just physical—they were part of a <strong>larger, metaphysical process</strong>.

The book does a great job showing how these alchemists were experimenting with real substances but believed in the <strong>spirits</strong> behind those substances. Glauber saw <strong>salt</strong> as a force of <strong>purification</strong>—a way to cleanse both matter and the soul.

---

[Cut to an image of Isaac Newton, with subtle celestial and alchemical symbols surrounding him.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
And finally, even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> was on this alchemical path. We all know Newton for his work on <strong>gravity</strong> and <strong>optics</strong>, but this book reveals how obsessed he was with <strong>alchemy</strong>, particularly with <strong>acids</strong>. Newton believed that <strong>acids</strong> were key to understanding the <strong>entire universe</strong>, and he applied his alchemical knowledge to his scientific experiments.

What’s fascinating is that Newton saw acids as having a <strong>spiritual dimension</strong>—they weren’t just corrosive liquids. He thought they were connected to the same <strong>universal forces</strong> that governed the planets. This is where the book really shines—by showing how thinkers like Newton were straddling the line between <strong>spiritual alchemy</strong> and <strong>empirical science</strong>.

<strong>Host:</strong>  
So, if you want to expand your mind and dive into the mystical roots of modern science, *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry&quot;* is a journey worth taking. It’s not just about how <strong>alchemy turned into chemistry</strong>—it’s about how <strong>science was born</strong> from a worldview that saw <strong>matter and spirit</strong> as one.

We tend to think of <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> as two completely separate worlds—one steeped in mysticism and the other driven by rational science. But what if I told you that modern chemistry grew directly out of alchemy’s blend of <strong>spiritual philosophy</strong> and <strong>empirical experimentation</strong>? That’s the fascinating story behind *“The History of Alchemy and Chemistry,”* a book that dives into how some of the greatest minds in history—<strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, <strong>Glauber</strong>, and even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>—helped shape both worlds.

What’s really exciting about this book is how it shows us that these early thinkers weren’t just chasing mystical ideas—they were doing <strong>real science</strong>. They saw the <strong>physical and spiritual</strong> as deeply connected, and that’s what laid the groundwork for modern chemistry. If you’re someone who loves exploring the <strong>origins of science</strong>, this book is a dazzling journey into how <strong>alchemy</strong> became <strong>chemistry</strong>—a transition that was both <strong>philosophical</strong> and <strong>practical</strong>.

This book is eye-opening because it reveals how <strong>chemistry</strong> as we know it today came from the <strong>theories and experiments</strong> of alchemists who were looking at matter through a very different lens. They believed that <strong>metals</strong> and <strong>elements</strong> weren’t just substances—they were infused with <strong>spiritual forces</strong> that could be harnessed through alchemy.

Let’s take <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, for example. He’s a key figure in this transition, and his ideas about <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong> are at the heart of what made alchemy such an intriguing precursor to modern science.

[Cut to an image of Paracelsus, with subtle animations of alchemical symbols.]

<strong>Host (voiceover):</strong>  
Paracelsus believed that all matter was made up of three core elements: <strong>mercury</strong>, <strong>sulfur</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong>—what he called the <strong>tria prima</strong>. But he didn’t just think of these as physical substances. <strong>Philosophical mercury</strong>, for instance, wasn’t just the liquid metal we all know. For Paracelsus, it was a <strong>spiritual essence</strong>—the force that allowed matter to change, to transform. In his view, mercury represented the <strong>spirit</strong> or <strong>life force</strong> in all things, while sulfur stood for the <strong>soul</strong>, and salt represented the <strong>body</strong> or material substance.

What’s fascinating is that Paracelsus didn’t leave these ideas in the realm of philosophy. He used them to drive <strong>real experiments</strong>—to test and change substances, to develop medicines, and even to theorize about the nature of disease. This was the early version of <strong>chemical experimentation</strong>, but it was still embedded in a spiritual worldview.

The book does an incredible job showing how Paracelsus’s concept of <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> wasn’t just a mystical symbol. It was a <strong>practical theory</strong> about how transformation worked at both the material and metaphysical levels. It’s a perfect example of how <strong>alchemy</strong> was both a <strong>science</strong> and a <strong>philosophy</strong> of nature.

[Cut to an image of Van Helmont, with dynamic visuals of gases and experimental equipment.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
Then we have <strong>Johann Baptista Van Helmont</strong>, who took these ideas further and helped develop what we now recognize as the early study of <strong>gases</strong>. He was the first to identify <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>, or as he called it, <strong>“gas sylvestre.”</strong> But like Paracelsus, Van Helmont didn’t separate the <strong>spiritual</strong> from the <strong>physical</strong>. He believed that gases, like all substances, had an underlying <strong>spiritual force</strong>—a kind of <strong>wild energy</strong> that animated matter.

Where things get really interesting is his work with <strong>salt</strong>. For Van Helmont, <strong>salt</strong> wasn’t just a simple chemical compound—it was a <strong>spiritual substance</strong> that could dissolve and transform matter. This idea led him to conduct <strong>experiments</strong> on how salts interact with other elements, bridging the gap between the mystical theories of alchemy and the <strong>empirical studies</strong> that would eventually become modern chemistry.

The book explains how Van Helmont’s work with salts and gases laid the groundwork for what we now call <strong>chemical reactions</strong>. But at the same time, he was deeply invested in the idea that these reactions were governed by <strong>spiritual principles</strong>, connecting the <strong>material</strong> and the <strong>metaphysical</strong>.

[Cut to an image of Glauber, with a clean, industrial setting for visual contrast.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
Next, we get to <strong>Johann Glauber</strong>, a figure who helped push alchemy even further toward practical chemistry. Glauber discovered <strong>sodium sulfate</strong>, or <strong>Glauber’s Salt</strong>, and his work was more grounded in the practical uses of chemical substances. He’s often seen as one of the first <strong>industrial chemists</strong>, but what’s so fascinating is that even though Glauber was focused on the <strong>practical applications</strong> of alchemical principles, he still believed in the <strong>spiritual significance</strong> of the substances he worked with.

The book shows how Glauber’s alchemical work with salts wasn’t just about industrial uses—it was about <strong>purification</strong> on both a material and spiritual level. This mix of <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>early chemical engineering</strong> is what makes his contributions so unique. Glauber saw his experiments not just as ways to improve production but as ways to understand the <strong>deeper laws of nature</strong>.

[Cut to an image of Isaac Newton, with a background of scientific diagrams and alchemical symbols.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
And yes, even <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> was part of this alchemical tradition. Newton may be famous for his laws of <strong>motion</strong> and <strong>gravity</strong>, but he was also deeply invested in <strong>alchemy</strong>. This book reveals how Newton’s study of <strong>acids</strong> was tied to his belief that <strong>chemical reactions</strong> were governed by the same forces that controlled the motion of the planets.

Newton’s work on <strong>acids</strong> wasn’t just chemical—it was <strong>cosmic</strong>. He believed that acids were a key to understanding the <strong>universe</strong>, that the same forces driving chemical change also underpinned the very structure of reality. This is where the book really dazzles—it connects the dots between Newton’s <strong>scientific genius</strong> and his alchemical explorations.

---

[Closing Scene: The host leans forward, engaging directly with the viewer.]

<strong>Host:</strong>  
So if you’re fascinated by how the early alchemists merged <strong>philosophy</strong>, <strong>spirituality</strong>, and <strong>science</strong> into one transformative practice, *&quot;The History of Alchemy and Chemistry&quot;* is a book that will take you on a journey through the minds that shaped modern chemistry. Paracelsus’s ideas about <strong>philosophical mercury</strong> and the <strong>spirits of metals</strong>, Van Helmont’s studies of <strong>gases</strong>, and Newton’s alchemical investigations into <strong>acids</strong> all come together to show how the mystical and the empirical weren’t separate at all—they were different aspects of the same quest for understanding the <strong>nature of reality</strong>.

This version strikes a more <strong>academic yet engaging</strong> tone, focusing on making complex ideas about <strong>alchemy and chemistry</strong> accessible to a popular audience, with just enough intellectual depth to keep science enthusiasts engaged. It balances the <strong>spiritual and scientific aspects</strong> of alchemy while focusing on how these early ideas laid the groundwork for <strong>modern chemical experimentation</strong>.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>I really liked &quot;We tend to think of alchemy and chemistry as two completely separate worlds&quot; can you give me a half dozen suggestions of ways to flesh out this aspect of the introduction</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are six different ways to flesh out the theme of the relationship between <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> as two seemingly separate worlds, expanding on the idea in different directions:

---

1. <strong>We tend to think of alchemy and chemistry as two completely separate worlds—one rooted in mystical symbols and arcane rituals, the other defined by precise measurements and scientific rigor. But the truth is, the origins of chemistry are deeply intertwined with alchemy’s quest for transformation, both material and spiritual. This book takes us back to a time when the lines between these worlds were blurred, and scientific inquiry was still infused with metaphysical meaning.</strong>  

2. <strong>It’s easy to think of alchemy as something mystical and outdated, and chemistry as a modern, practical science. But what this book shows is that these two fields aren’t as separate as we might think. In fact, the early chemists were alchemists—they believed that understanding matter wasn’t just about the physical world, but about tapping into deeper, hidden forces. This history reveals how science evolved out of a search for both physical and spiritual transformation.</strong>  

3. <strong>We often think of chemistry as a clean break from alchemy—a triumph of reason over superstition. But when you dig into the history, you find that the early chemists were still working within the framework of alchemy. They were trying to decode the mysteries of matter using both spiritual insights and experimental methods. This book shows how modern chemistry grew out of alchemy’s symbolic universe, where turning lead into gold was just one part of a broader quest to understand life, matter, and even the divine.</strong>  

4. <strong>We tend to separate alchemy and chemistry into different categories—alchemy as magical thinking, chemistry as hard science. But that’s a simplification. In the early modern period, alchemy and chemistry were part of the same continuum. Alchemists were serious experimenters who saw the physical world and the spiritual world as deeply connected. Their pursuit of transmutation wasn’t just about changing metals, but about changing our understanding of reality. This book brings that journey to life.</strong>  

5. <strong>At first glance, alchemy and chemistry seem like opposites—one focused on spiritual transformation and hidden knowledge, the other on laboratory experiments and reproducible results. But the reality is much more nuanced. The transition from alchemy to chemistry was a gradual evolution, and the early chemists were still deeply influenced by alchemical ideas about matter and spirit. This book explores how those early thinkers merged their mystical insights with practical experiments to give birth to modern chemistry.</strong>  

6. <strong>When we think of chemistry today, we imagine precise lab work, equations, and experiments. Alchemy, on the other hand, conjures images of medieval wizards chasing immortality and impossible transformations. But these two fields were once intimately connected. The early chemists were also alchemists, and their experiments were driven by a belief in the spiritual essence of matter. This book takes us through that fascinating history, where alchemy’s metaphysical theories became the foundations of modern chemistry.</strong>

---

Each version provides a different angle on the same core idea: the <strong>interconnectedness</strong> of <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong>, exploring how their apparent differences are, in fact, part of a shared historical evolution.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>give me some ideas for examples that the audience might recognize of these two approaches</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are several ideas for examples that highlight the connection between <strong>alchemy’s mystical approach</strong> and <strong>chemistry’s scientific approach</strong>, using recognizable concepts or historical figures that your audience might already be familiar with:

---

1. <strong>Alchemy’s Philosopher&#x27;s Stone vs. Chemistry’s Modern Pursuit of Elements:</strong>
   - In alchemy, the philosopher&#x27;s stone was the legendary substance that could transform base metals into gold. It wasn’t just about wealth—it symbolized <strong>ultimate transformation</strong>, even spiritual enlightenment. Compare that to chemistry today, where scientists isolate and study <strong>elements</strong> like gold, platinum, and others using highly controlled laboratory processes. Alchemists’ search for transformation is echoed in <strong>modern materials science</strong>, where researchers now attempt to create new synthetic elements or find ways to manipulate existing ones for industrial and technological purposes.

---

2. <strong>Isaac Newton: A Scientist and an Alchemist:</strong>
   - Most people know Isaac Newton for his contributions to physics—his work on <strong>gravity</strong> and <strong>motion</strong>. But what’s less known is that Newton spent years conducting alchemical experiments. He wrote extensively about the <strong>spiritual and material</strong> transformation of metals and even believed that there was a hidden <strong>divine force</strong> in matter. His work on the <strong>nature of acids</strong> blended his alchemical interests with scientific inquiry, an example of how one person worked within both worlds.

---

3. <strong>Ancient Alchemy’s Elixirs vs. Modern Pharmaceutical Chemistry:</strong>
   - Alchemists were constantly searching for the <strong>elixir of life</strong>—a mystical potion that could cure all diseases and grant immortality. While this might sound far-fetched, it’s not too different from <strong>modern pharmaceutical chemistry</strong>, where the search for <strong>miracle drugs</strong> like antibiotics, antivirals, or even cancer cures is still a driving force. Today, scientists use rigorous experimentation, but the alchemical impulse to discover a universal remedy lives on in the pursuit of <strong>new medical breakthroughs</strong>.

---

4. <strong>Alchemy’s Transmutation vs. Nuclear Chemistry:</strong>
   - Alchemists dreamed of turning <strong>lead into gold</strong>—an act of <strong>transmutation</strong> that symbolized both material and spiritual transformation. While they didn’t succeed in that form, <strong>modern nuclear chemistry</strong> actually <strong>transmutes elements</strong> at the atomic level. By bombarding elements with particles, scientists can transform one element into another—a realization of the alchemical dream, but with a completely different method and understanding of matter.

---

5. <strong>Paracelsus’s Chemical Medicine vs. Modern Pharmacology:</strong>
   - Paracelsus, one of the key figures in alchemy, believed that <strong>illnesses</strong> were caused by <strong>imbalances</strong> in the body&#x27;s chemicals and that using purified minerals and metals could restore health. This approach led to the development of <strong>iatrochemistry</strong>—the application of chemicals in medicine. Modern pharmacology works on similar principles, where <strong>specific compounds</strong> are used to target disease pathways in the body. Paracelsus’s idea that certain <strong>substances</strong> could heal specific ailments paved the way for our understanding of how <strong>drugs interact with human biology</strong> today.

---

6. <strong>Mystical Alchemical Symbols vs. Chemical Symbols:</strong>
   - Alchemists used elaborate symbols to represent elements and compounds—<strong>mercury</strong>, <strong>sulfur</strong>, and <strong>salt</strong> were more than just substances; they were metaphors for spirit, soul, and body. Compare that to modern chemistry, where elements are represented by symbols like <strong>H</strong> for hydrogen or <strong>Au</strong> for gold, and the periodic table organizes them based on atomic structure. While the symbols themselves may look different, both systems serve as a <strong>codified language</strong> for understanding the building blocks of the universe.

---

7. <strong>Alchemy’s Hidden Truths vs. Chemistry’s Hidden Properties:</strong>
   - Alchemists believed that there were <strong>hidden truths</strong> in nature, accessible only through study, meditation, and experimentation. Modern chemistry carries on this quest but in a scientific context—chemists today continue to unlock the <strong>hidden properties</strong> of matter, whether it’s the discovery of new <strong>subatomic particles</strong> or the development of <strong>quantum chemistry</strong> to explain behaviors that were once invisible. The <strong>drive to uncover the secrets of nature</strong> links both alchemy and chemistry, despite their different methods.

Each of these examples provides a concrete connection between the <strong>spiritual and symbolic</strong> approach of <strong>alchemy</strong> and the <strong>empirical and experimental</strong> approach of <strong>chemistry</strong>, illustrating how these two seemingly different pursuits share common roots and goals.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>I like the idea of juxtaposing magical potions with modern medicine. Rewrite the introduction with those examples in mind. Give me five different versions that experiment with different literary allusions, and three versions that are more academic</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are five <strong>literary-inspired</strong> versions of the introduction, followed by three <strong>more academic</strong> versions, all based on the juxtaposition between <strong>alchemy’s magical potions</strong> and <strong>modern medicine</strong>:

### <strong>Literary Allusions:</strong>

---

<strong>Version 1: Allusion to Harry Potter and Alchemical Elixirs</strong>  
*“We all know about magical potions from fantasy stories—the kind that can heal any wound, cure any curse, or grant eternal life. But what if I told you that the alchemists of centuries past were just as obsessed with these mystical elixirs? In fact, their pursuit of the <strong>elixir of life</strong> wasn’t all that different from modern pharmaceutical companies hunting for the next <strong>miracle drug</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we see how figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> moved from magical potions to <strong>chemical medicines</strong>, laying the foundations for the <strong>pharmaceutical science</strong> we rely on today. Their experiments with <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> may seem like ancient wizardry, but they were just as much about real healing as they were about transmuting matter.”*

---

<strong>Version 2: Allusion to Faust and the Pursuit of Knowledge</strong>  
*“Like Goethe’s <strong>Faust</strong>, who makes a pact with the devil in his unrelenting quest for knowledge, alchemists once searched for an <strong>elixir of life</strong> that would bring them ultimate power and understanding. But what’s fascinating is that this search for mystical potions wasn’t abandoned. It transformed. Today, <strong>pharmacologists</strong> continue this legacy, seeking the next breakthrough cure, working in the space where the pursuit of power meets the <strong>healing arts</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we follow alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, who believed that the key to transforming metals might also hold the secret to transforming <strong>human health</strong>. Their legacy lives on in every modern laboratory.”*

---

<strong>Version 3: Allusion to Shakespeare and the Magical World of Potions</strong>  
*“Shakespeare often wrote about potions that could make lovers fall asleep, fake death, or even drive someone mad. Alchemists weren’t so different—they too believed in the power of <strong>transformational elixirs</strong>. But what’s fascinating is how their mystical concoctions paved the way for the real-world science of <strong>pharmacy</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we see how alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> searched for the ultimate <strong>healing potion</strong> and laid the groundwork for the modern development of drugs. Their quest for the <strong>elixir of life</strong> wasn’t just about magic—it was the precursor to modern <strong>medicine</strong>.”*

---

<strong>Version 4: Allusion to Tolkien’s Magical World of Elves and Healing Potions</strong>  
*“In Tolkien’s world, the <strong>elves</strong> had healing potions that could cure any wound, their knowledge of nature and herbs being so advanced it felt like magic. What’s incredible is that, in the real world, alchemists were pursuing their own version of this—a quest for <strong>the philosopher’s stone</strong> and <strong>elixirs</strong> that could cure all ailments. But far from being mere fantasy, their work was the beginning of modern <strong>medicine</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we see how their <strong>alchemy</strong> became <strong>science</strong>, evolving from magical thinking into the empirical study of <strong>chemical compounds</strong> we know today.”*

---

<strong>Version 5: Allusion to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the Quest for the Elixir of Life</strong>  
*“In <strong>Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein</strong>, the quest for knowledge turns dark as science seeks to cheat death. Alchemists had a similar dream—the search for the <strong>elixir of life</strong> that could heal and extend human existence indefinitely. But while Frankenstein’s experiments led to disaster, the alchemists’ work laid the foundation for something more enduring: <strong>modern pharmacology</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we explore how figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> and <strong>Glauber</strong> turned mystical potions into the first <strong>chemical medicines</strong>, transforming alchemy’s spiritual ambitions into the scientific pursuit of <strong>healing</strong> and <strong>restoration</strong>.”

---

### <strong>Academic Versions:</strong>

---

<strong>Version 1: Academic, Emphasizing the Evolution of Healing Practices</strong>  
*“We tend to think of alchemy and chemistry as two completely separate worlds—one filled with mystical potions and the other with precise, scientific formulas. But in reality, alchemy laid the groundwork for modern <strong>medicine</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we trace how alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> transitioned from seeking the <strong>elixir of life</strong>—a cure-all potion meant to heal every disease—into developing early forms of <strong>chemical medicines</strong>. Their experiments with substances like <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> formed the basis for what would later become <strong>pharmaceutical chemistry</strong>, blurring the lines between mystical healing and scientific inquiry.”*

---

<strong>Version 2: Academic, Focused on the Legacy of Alchemical Thought in Medicine</strong>  
*“The search for a <strong>universal cure</strong> was central to the alchemical tradition, with the elusive <strong>elixir of life</strong> at the forefront of their endeavors. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, the book explores how this ancient quest wasn’t abandoned with the rise of modern science but instead evolved into the rigorous discipline of <strong>pharmacology</strong>. Figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> laid the foundation for modern medicine by experimenting with chemical compounds, aiming not only for spiritual enlightenment but for practical treatments. This transition from <strong>magical potions</strong> to the development of <strong>therapeutic drugs</strong> reveals how early alchemical practices shaped the foundations of <strong>pharmaceutical science</strong> today.”*

---

<strong>Version 3: Academic, Exploring the Intersection of Mysticism and Empiricism in Medicine</strong>  
*“In the early modern period, the boundary between <strong>alchemy</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong> was far less distinct than it is today. Alchemists, while engaged in the search for spiritual transformation, were also the forerunners of modern <strong>pharmacology</strong>. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we see how alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> applied their knowledge of substances such as <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> not only in the pursuit of mystical goals but also in creating <strong>chemical medicines</strong>. Their quest for the <strong>elixir of life</strong> evolved into the development of real treatments for illness, making them precursors to modern pharmaceutical science. This text provides an insightful look into how <strong>alchemy’s mystical potions</strong> directly influenced the empirical practices of <strong>medicine</strong> and <strong>chemistry</strong>.”*

These versions maintain the focus on the <strong>juxtaposition</strong> of <strong>alchemy’s magical potions</strong> and <strong>modern medicine</strong>, but with different tones, literary references, and levels of complexity, tailored for both <strong>popular</strong> and <strong>academic</strong> audiences.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>Never mention Harry Potter to me again, but suggest a few more ideas of references to alchemy in literature, movies, or video games.</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Absolutely! Here are several more references to <strong>alchemy</strong> in <strong>literature</strong>, <strong>movies</strong>, and <strong>video games</strong> that could enrich your introduction without leaning on Harry Potter:

---

### <strong>Literature:</strong>

1. <strong>&quot;The Alchemist&quot; by Paulo Coelho</strong>  
   - In this popular novel, the protagonist embarks on a journey to find the <strong>philosopher&#x27;s stone</strong> and the <strong>elixir of life</strong>, but ultimately discovers that the true &quot;gold&quot; is spiritual wisdom and personal transformation. You could draw parallels between the book’s themes of <strong>self-discovery</strong> and how historical alchemists were often searching for both material and <strong>spiritual transmutation</strong> in their experiments.

2. <strong>&quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; by Umberto Eco</strong>  
   - Set in a medieval monastery, the novel weaves in elements of <strong>hermetic knowledge</strong> and alchemy as central to the story. Characters debate the power of secret knowledge, and the tension between <strong>mystical thinking</strong> and the emerging scientific method mirrors the transition from alchemy to chemistry.

3. <strong>&quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (Manga/Anime)</strong>  
   - In this famous series, alchemy is both a <strong>philosophical system</strong> and a <strong>scientific practice</strong>. The central characters use alchemy to transmute matter, but the story also dives into the <strong>moral and philosophical consequences</strong> of such power. This is a great way to show how alchemy’s principles of <strong>equivalent exchange</strong> reflect early scientific attempts to balance <strong>spiritual and material</strong> realities.

---

### <strong>Movies:</strong>

1. <strong>&quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006)</strong>  
   - The film focuses on two magicians in a rivalry to master the ultimate illusion, but behind the magic is an exploration of <strong>scientific discovery</strong>, <strong>alchemy</strong>, and the boundaries between <strong>illusion</strong> and <strong>reality</strong>. The character of Nikola Tesla (though more associated with electricity) plays a role akin to an alchemist, blending science with the <strong>seemingly impossible</strong>. This reference can highlight how early alchemists blurred the line between <strong>the impossible</strong> and <strong>scientific inquiry</strong>.

2. <strong>&quot;Pan’s Labyrinth&quot; (2006)</strong>  
   - Guillermo del Toro’s film blends dark fantasy with historical elements, featuring characters seeking <strong>magical solutions</strong> to real-world problems. The <strong>symbolism of transformation</strong> (such as in the labyrinth and the magical key) echoes alchemical quests for hidden truths and the <strong>power of transformation</strong>. This could be used to emphasize how alchemy, too, was about uncovering <strong>hidden forces</strong> behind the material world.

3. <strong>&quot;The Fountain&quot; (2006)</strong>  
   - This film, with its multi-layered narrative, revolves around a character searching for the <strong>tree of life</strong> and a <strong>cure for mortality</strong>, much like alchemists sought the <strong>elixir of life</strong>. The film blends metaphysical and scientific themes, making it a great reference for illustrating how alchemists sought both <strong>immortality</strong> and <strong>scientific breakthroughs</strong>.

---

### <strong>Video Games:</strong>

1. <strong>&quot;Assassin’s Creed&quot; Series (Ezio Trilogy and Origins)</strong>  
   - In this historical action-adventure series, <strong>alchemy</strong> plays a subtle but significant role, especially when exploring <strong>Templar mysticism</strong> and <strong>ancient technologies</strong>. The series hints at hidden knowledge and the alchemists’ pursuit of control over <strong>matter and power</strong>, similar to how early scientists and philosophers sought to uncover the <strong>secrets of nature</strong> through experimentation.

2. <strong>&quot;Dark Souls&quot; Series</strong>  
   - The world of <strong>Dark Souls</strong> is heavily influenced by <strong>alchemical</strong> and <strong>hermetic philosophy</strong>, especially in its themes of <strong>fire</strong> and <strong>transmutation</strong>. The gameplay revolves around <strong>metaphysical concepts of life and death</strong>, with references to <strong>philosophical alchemy</strong> in the quests for <strong>souls</strong> and <strong>immortality</strong>. The imagery and atmosphere evoke the alchemical search for enlightenment and power through transformation.

3. <strong>&quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;</strong>  
   - Alchemy plays a practical role in this game, where <strong>Geralt</strong> uses potions, bombs, and oils based on <strong>alchemical recipes</strong>. More deeply, the world of &quot;The Witcher&quot; involves themes of <strong>mutation</strong> and <strong>transformation</strong>, which directly reflect the alchemical practices of changing one thing into another, be it the protagonist’s use of <strong>potions</strong> or the deeper, philosophical elements of <strong>magical transmutation</strong>.

---

These references can be used to help frame your argument, illustrating how the <strong>themes of alchemy</strong> continue to resonate in <strong>modern storytelling</strong>, whether through literature, movies, or games. They reflect alchemy’s enduring influence on the collective imagination and how its blend of <strong>mysticism and proto-science</strong> still captures our interest today.</div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>Let&#x27;s rewrite the intro to mention pan&#x27;s labyrinth, and then proceed with the contrast between magic and science using potions and medicine. Give me three more versions of the intro</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>Version 1: &quot;Pan’s Labyrinth&quot; and the Evolution from Alchemy to Chemistry</strong>

<strong>Host (calm, inviting tone):</strong>  
In <strong>Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth</strong>, we see a world where the mystical and the material collide—where magical solutions are sought for real-world problems. The protagonist’s journey to uncover <strong>hidden truths</strong> parallels the historical quest of alchemists, who believed that <strong>matter and spirit</strong> were intertwined. They sought <strong>elixirs of life</strong>, potions that could heal or even grant immortality. But what’s fascinating is that this ancient quest wasn’t just about magic—it laid the foundation for <strong>modern chemistry</strong> and <strong>medicine</strong>.

In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we explore how early alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> and <strong>Van Helmont</strong> were bridging the gap between <strong>mystical potions</strong> and real <strong>chemical experimentation</strong>. Their search for the <strong>philosopher’s stone</strong> evolved into something more tangible—the development of <strong>chemical medicines</strong> that would eventually form the basis of modern <strong>pharmacology</strong>. The mystical pursuit of transformation wasn’t abandoned; it was redefined through science.

---

### <strong>Version 2: &quot;Pan’s Labyrinth&quot; and the Alchemical Quest for Transformation</strong>

<strong>Host (thoughtful, engaging tone):</strong>  
In <strong>Pan’s Labyrinth</strong>, the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur as characters seek <strong>magical remedies</strong> to navigate their challenges. This quest for <strong>hidden knowledge</strong> mirrors the work of early alchemists, who believed that <strong>mystical potions</strong> could unlock the secrets of life, health, and matter itself. They pursued the <strong>elixir of life</strong>, seeking both spiritual enlightenment and practical healing.

What’s incredible is that this pursuit didn’t fade with time—it transformed. In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, we see how figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> took the ancient search for potions and <strong>alchemical transmutations</strong> and began applying those ideas to the development of real <strong>medicines</strong>. Their work laid the groundwork for modern <strong>pharmaceutical science</strong>, proving that what began as a mystical practice evolved into an <strong>empirical pursuit</strong> of <strong>healing</strong> and <strong>transformation</strong>.

---

### <strong>Version 3: &quot;Pan’s Labyrinth&quot; and the Bridge Between Magic and Science</strong>

<strong>Host (intriguing, reflective tone):</strong>  
<strong>Pan’s Labyrinth</strong> immerses us in a world where the <strong>mystical</strong> and the <strong>real</strong> exist side by side, where potions and magical artifacts offer solutions to both fantastical and tangible problems. This mirrors the journey of the early alchemists, who believed that through <strong>alchemy</strong>, they could achieve profound transformations—not just of metals, but of <strong>health</strong> and <strong>life itself</strong>. The alchemists&#x27; pursuit of <strong>magical potions</strong>, like the <strong>elixir of life</strong>, represents the merging of the spiritual and the scientific.

In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, the book traces how these early thinkers didn’t abandon the mystical—they evolved it. Figures like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> began experimenting with <strong>chemical substances</strong>, turning what was once the domain of magic into the first real steps toward <strong>modern medicine</strong>. Their quest for transformative potions became the foundation of <strong>pharmaceutical science</strong>, showing us how the line between magic and science is thinner than we think.

---

### <strong>Version 4: &quot;Pan’s Labyrinth&quot; and Alchemy’s Transition to Modern Medicine</strong>

<strong>Host (inviting, slightly mystical tone):</strong>  
In <strong>Pan’s Labyrinth</strong>, we’re drawn into a world where characters seek out <strong>magical solutions</strong> to their most pressing problems. This mirrors the alchemists of the past, who were searching for their own form of magic—<strong>potions</strong> and <strong>elixirs</strong> that could heal any disease or grant eternal life. Their pursuit of these transformations wasn’t just symbolic; it was an early form of <strong>scientific inquiry</strong>.

In *The History of Alchemy and Chemistry*, the book explores how alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong> transitioned from the <strong>mystical quest</strong> for the <strong>elixir of life</strong> to the more <strong>practical experimentation</strong> that laid the foundation for <strong>modern pharmacology</strong>. Their work shows us how <strong>alchemy</strong> didn’t simply fade away—it evolved, with the ancient quest for magical healing becoming the birth of <strong>chemical medicine</strong>. Today’s pharmaceuticals owe their origins to this profound transformation.

---

Each of these versions draws on the thematic parallels between <strong>Pan’s Labyrinth</strong> and alchemy’s search for transformation, using the contrast between <strong>magical potions</strong> and <strong>modern medicine</strong> to set the stage for a broader discussion on how alchemy laid the groundwork for <strong>empirical science</strong> and <strong>pharmaceutical chemistry</strong>.</div>

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are several additional ideas for visually representing <strong>chemical theories</strong> in your video, blending the aesthetics of <strong>alchemy</strong> with the precision of <strong>modern chemistry</strong>:

---

### <strong>1. Elemental Transformation Animation</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Alchemy Symbols Morphing into Chemical Elements:</strong> Start with traditional <strong>alchemical glyphs</strong> (e.g., for gold, lead, mercury) and slowly transform them into their modern <strong>chemical symbols</strong> (Au for gold, Pb for lead, Hg for mercury).
  
<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- As the <strong>alchemical symbols glow</strong>, they break apart or dissolve, gradually forming <strong>modern atomic structures</strong> with electrons orbiting the nucleus, symbolizing the shift from <strong>mystical interpretation</strong> to <strong>scientific understanding</strong>.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
When discussing the <strong>philosopher&#x27;s stone</strong> or the transmutation of metals.

---

### <strong>2. Visualizing Chemical Bonds</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Atom and Bond Animation:</strong> Illustrate <strong>chemical bonds</strong> by showing atoms (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen) connecting via bonds to form <strong>compounds</strong> like H₂O. Show the <strong>atomic structure</strong> using a glowing visual representation, giving it a <strong>magical aura</strong> as the bonds form.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- Use <strong>color-coded glowing lines</strong> to represent <strong>covalent</strong> and <strong>ionic bonds</strong>. For instance, when explaining how alchemists believed different elements had spiritual essences, you can animate these <strong>bonds as mystical threads</strong> forming chemical compounds.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Great for discussing how the <strong>spirits of metals</strong> could be understood as early attempts to describe chemical reactions and bonding.

---

### <strong>3. Distillation and Sublimation Process Animation</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Alchemical Flask to Modern Chemical Distillation:</strong> Show a classic <strong>alchemical alembic</strong> or distillation flask with vapor rising and condensing into liquid. Transition this process into a <strong>modern chemical apparatus</strong> (e.g., a <strong>fractional distillation setup</strong> in a lab) to show how alchemical experiments evolved into modern chemical techniques.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- Use <strong>animated vapor trails</strong> that rise from the heated liquid, changing color and shape as the apparatus becomes more modern, symbolizing the progression of chemical understanding. The flask could have <strong>alchemical symbols floating within the vapor</strong>, gradually transforming into <strong>chemical formulas</strong> as the liquid condenses.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Best used when discussing the <strong>distillation of mercury</strong> or <strong>alchemical purification</strong> techniques and how they laid the groundwork for modern <strong>chemical separations</strong>.

---

### <strong>4. Periodic Table Highlight with Elemental Reactions</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Dynamic Periodic Table:</strong> Use the <strong>periodic table</strong> as a living, glowing grid. Highlight different elements as they are discussed, showing how each one interacts or transforms during a chemical reaction.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- When explaining a specific reaction (e.g., <strong>mercury turning into gold</strong> in alchemical lore), highlight the elements involved, with <strong>chemical reaction arrows</strong> appearing between them. <strong>Colorful energy trails</strong> can connect the elements, representing the <strong>mystical transformation</strong> alchemists believed in, followed by a transition to the <strong>actual reaction</strong> (e.g., Hg remains Hg with no transmutation possible).
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Useful when explaining how <strong>alchemy’s dream of element transmutation</strong> led to early theories about <strong>atomic structures</strong> and how elements relate to each other.

---

### <strong>5. Split-Screen of Alchemical Formulas vs. Chemical Equations</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Side-by-Side Comparison of Alchemical and Chemical Formulas:</strong> On the left side, show an <strong>ancient alchemical manuscript</strong> with handwritten symbols, squiggly lines, and glyphs. On the right side, present the <strong>modern chemical notation</strong> for the same substances.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- As the camera pans across the two, <strong>mystical symbols</strong> on the left slowly transform into <strong>chemical equations</strong> on the right (e.g., transforming “philosophical mercury” into its modern-day molecular form, Hg). Add <strong>glowing transitions</strong> between the two to emphasize the evolution from <strong>mystical interpretations</strong> to <strong>empirical science</strong>.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Perfect for contrasting the mystical writings of <strong>Paracelsus</strong> with modern <strong>chemical formulas</strong>.

---

### <strong>6. Glowing Particle Simulation for Atomic Models</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Atomic Models with Floating Particles:</strong> Represent chemical reactions at the atomic level by showing a close-up of an atom’s nucleus with <strong>protons and neutrons</strong> surrounded by <strong>electrons in orbit</strong>. When discussing chemical changes, <strong>glowing particles</strong> (electrons or atoms) could move toward or away from the nucleus to represent <strong>reaction dynamics</strong>.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- Use <strong>glowing, pulsing particles</strong> that split apart, come together, or move energetically around the nucleus. This will give a visual representation of <strong>atomic interactions</strong> and <strong>bond formations</strong>. Make it mystical by having the particles leave <strong>trails of light</strong>, similar to the way alchemists believed matter could transform through energetic forces.

<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Ideal for explaining how modern chemistry has broken down the atom and molecules, which alchemists would have seen as <strong>spiritual energies</strong>.

---

### <strong>7. Philosophical Mercury as Vapor vs. Real Mercury’s Properties</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Mercury Animation:</strong> Start with <strong>animated vapor</strong> rising from a flask to represent <strong>philosophical mercury</strong>, the <strong>spiritual essence</strong> that alchemists believed controlled transformation. Gradually transition this to a real-life depiction of <strong>liquid mercury</strong>—dense, heavy, and reflective.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- Show the <strong>fluid nature of mercury</strong> by animating the liquid as it moves and shifts, reflecting light. As the camera zooms in, mystical symbols float around it, then dissolve as modern chemistry takes over, explaining <strong>Hg’s actual properties</strong> in scientific terms (e.g., its boiling point, density, and toxicity).
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Great for when discussing <strong>Paracelsus’s mercury theories</strong> and their significance in both alchemy and early chemistry.

---

### <strong>8. Chemical Reactions in a Modern Lab with Superimposed Alchemical Symbols</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Modern Chemical Experiment with Mystical Overlay:</strong> Show a <strong>modern chemist</strong> conducting an experiment with real chemicals, such as a titration or precipitation reaction. <strong>Superimpose</strong> mystical alchemical symbols or glowing geometric shapes over the equipment to symbolize the transformation alchemists sought.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- As the chemical reaction occurs (e.g., a color change in a flask), have <strong>mystical symbols float out of the solution</strong> and then <strong>dissolve</strong> into modern chemical formulas, showing how science evolved from <strong>mystical interpretations</strong> of reactions.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Best used when describing how alchemists performed similar experiments but interpreted the results through a <strong>spiritual lens</strong>.

---

### <strong>9. Alchemical Transmutation Circle to Modern Reaction Chamber</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Transmutation Circle Morphing into a Reaction Chamber:</strong> Start with an animated <strong>alchemy transmutation circle</strong>, filled with intricate lines, glyphs, and mystical symbols. As the host explains the alchemical process of transmutation, the circle glows and slowly <strong>transforms into a modern reaction chamber</strong> or laboratory flask setup.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- The <strong>circle glows and pulses</strong>, then shifts into a modern, scientifically accurate laboratory flask with gases or liquids reacting inside. The transformation should feel smooth, symbolizing the transition from <strong>alchemy’s symbolic practices</strong> to the <strong>practicality of modern chemistry</strong>.
  
<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Perfect for explaining how the <strong>alchemists&#x27; pursuit of transformation</strong> laid the foundation for modern <strong>chemical reactions</strong> and laboratories.

---

### <strong>10. Layered Visuals of Alchemical Texts vs. Scientific Journals</strong>
<strong>Visual Concept:</strong>
- <strong>Pages Turning from Alchemy to Modern Chemistry:</strong> Create a sequence where old, yellowed <strong>alchemical manuscripts</strong> turn into sleek, white <strong>modern scientific papers</strong>. As the pages flip, show short, highlighted text from alchemical instructions that gradually morph into modern scientific descriptions of the same processes.

<strong>Suggested Effect:</strong>
- The pages should <strong>glow</strong> with light as they transition, giving a sense of continuity between the <strong>mystical alchemical quest</strong> and the <strong>empirical scientific method</strong>. Include animated <strong>chemical equations</strong> or formulas that float off the page as the text transforms.

<strong>Use Case:</strong>  
Useful when describing how alchemical texts, once considered mystical, evolved into the highly structured <strong>scientific literature</strong> we have today.

<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>now give me some ideas for creating a video game alchemy lab sim using the theories discussed in the book</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here are several ideas for a <strong>video game alchemy lab simulation</strong> based on the <strong>theories</strong> discussed in the book, where players can experiment with <strong>alchemy</strong> and build their own labs, blending <strong>historical alchemical practices</strong> with <strong>modern game mechanics</strong>. The game could allow players to experiment with <strong>materials</strong>, <strong>elements</strong>, and <strong>alchemy equipment</strong>, while encountering <strong>challenges</strong> and <strong>disasters</strong> as they refine their lab and progress toward mastery.

---

### <strong>1. Game Concept: Alchemist’s Lab – A Historical Simulation</strong>
- <strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation / Strategy / Puzzle
- <strong>Setting:</strong> Set in a fictionalized version of <strong>early modern Europe</strong>, with historical alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, and <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> as mentors or rivals.
- <strong>Objective:</strong> The player takes the role of an aspiring alchemist, learning the secrets of <strong>alchemy</strong> through trial and error, experiments, and the development of their own <strong>alchemy lab</strong>. The ultimate goal is to achieve one or more of the classic <strong>alchemical goals</strong>: transmuting base metals into gold, creating the <strong>Philosopher’s Stone</strong>, or discovering the <strong>Elixir of Life</strong>.

---

### <strong>2. Gameplay Mechanics</strong>
- <strong>Lab Building:</strong> Players can customize and expand their <strong>alchemy lab</strong> by adding equipment like <strong>crucibles</strong>, <strong>retorts</strong>, <strong>alembics</strong>, <strong>furnaces</strong>, and <strong>distillation apparatuses</strong>. As the player advances, they unlock more advanced tools.
- <strong>Resource Management:</strong> Players must gather and manage <strong>raw materials</strong> such as <strong>lead</strong>, <strong>sulfur</strong>, <strong>mercury</strong>, <strong>herbs</strong>, and <strong>gems</strong>. They also need to maintain a stock of essential supplies like <strong>firewood</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, and <strong>metals</strong> for their experiments.
- <strong>Alchemy Experiments:</strong>  
  - Players can perform a wide range of alchemical experiments, such as <strong>transmutation of metals</strong>, <strong>distillation of volatile substances</strong>, and <strong>potion brewing</strong>. The experiments are based on <strong>historical alchemical theories</strong>, such as Paracelsus’s <strong>tria prima</strong> (sulfur, mercury, and salt), Van Helmont’s study of <strong>gases</strong>, or Glauber’s work on <strong>salts</strong>.
  - Experiments are interactive and require <strong>precision</strong> and <strong>timing</strong>. For example, controlling the temperature of a furnace during a transmutation, or distilling mercury without causing a toxic vapor disaster.
- <strong>Theories and Manuals:</strong> As players progress, they uncover ancient <strong>alchemical manuscripts</strong> that provide hints and instructions for advanced experiments. These manuals are inspired by real alchemical texts, and players must interpret the cryptic language and <strong>symbols</strong> to learn new <strong>formulas</strong> and <strong>processes</strong>.

---

### <strong>3. Core Game Systems</strong>

#### <strong>a. Element and Material System</strong>
- Players work with a system of <strong>elements and compounds</strong>, many of which are rooted in <strong>historical alchemy</strong>. The game could have a &quot;material spirit&quot; system, where each substance has <strong>physical properties</strong> (e.g., boiling point, weight) and <strong>mystical properties</strong> (e.g., volatility, transformation potential).
- <strong>Key Elements:</strong> 
  - <strong>Sulfur</strong> – Represents combustion and soul (🜍). Used in experiments involving fire and purification.
  - <strong>Mercury</strong> – Represents fluidity and spirit (☿). Used in distillation, transformation, and creating <strong>volatile compounds</strong>.
  - <strong>Salt</strong> – Represents solidity and body (🜔). Crucial in stabilizing potions and performing purification processes.

- <strong>Philosophical Mercury:</strong> Introduce <strong>&quot;philosophical mercury&quot;</strong> as a special resource that the player can synthesize after a series of complex, high-risk experiments. This mercury allows for <strong>transformative experiments</strong> like metal transmutation and is required to unlock the most powerful alchemical processes.

#### <strong>b. Lab Management</strong>
- <strong>Risk of Disasters:</strong> Players must manage their lab carefully, balancing the use of dangerous chemicals like <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>sulfur</strong>. Overheating a furnace or mishandling a volatile substance could cause accidents like <strong>crucible explosions</strong>, <strong>acid spills</strong>, or <strong>toxic gas leaks</strong>.
  - Example Disaster: &quot;Crucible Crack&quot; – The player heats the crucible too much during a metal transmutation, causing it to crack and spill molten lead. They must clean up the spill and repair the crucible before continuing.
  - Example Disaster: &quot;Mercury Vapor&quot; – If mercury is overheated during distillation, toxic mercury vapor escapes, causing the player to lose health points or damaging nearby equipment.
- <strong>Lab Upgrades:</strong> As players progress, they can upgrade their lab with better equipment (stronger crucibles, more precise alembics, advanced furnaces) and unlock new sections of the lab to conduct more complex experiments.

#### <strong>c. Experimentation and Progression</strong>
- <strong>Unlocking New Processes:</strong> Players start with simple experiments like creating basic <strong>potions</strong> or distilling <strong>herbs</strong>. As they gain knowledge, they unlock more complex processes like the <strong>transmutation of metals</strong> or <strong>synthesizing new elements</strong>.
  - Example: &quot;Lead into Gold&quot; – After extensive study of <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>sulfur</strong>, the player can attempt the classic alchemical transmutation of lead into gold. The success of the experiment depends on precise temperature control, use of special materials, and careful timing.
  - Example: &quot;Creating the Philosopher’s Stone&quot; – The final goal in the game could be creating the <strong>Philosopher’s Stone</strong>, requiring a complex series of experiments and mastery of all alchemical elements.

#### <strong>d. Health and Wellness System</strong>
- <strong>Health Management:</strong> Similar to historical alchemists who faced health risks, players must manage their <strong>alchemist’s health</strong>. Prolonged exposure to toxic substances like <strong>mercury</strong> can cause damage, and injuries from lab disasters must be treated with <strong>potions</strong> or rest.
- <strong>Alchemy Remedies:</strong> Players can also create <strong>healing elixirs</strong> and potions to cure themselves or other characters in the game. These remedies are based on <strong>iatrochemistry</strong>, with ingredients like <strong>mercury</strong>, <strong>salt</strong>, and <strong>herbs</strong> needed to make different medicinal compounds.

---

### <strong>4. Game Features and Special Modes</strong>

#### <strong>a. Mentor/Rival System</strong>
- <strong>Mentors:</strong> The player can learn from historical alchemists like <strong>Paracelsus</strong>, <strong>Van Helmont</strong>, and <strong>Glauber</strong>. Each mentor specializes in different branches of alchemy:
  - <strong>Paracelsus</strong>: Expert in <strong>chemical medicine</strong> and the <strong>tria prima</strong> theory.
  - <strong>Van Helmont</strong>: Master of <strong>gases</strong> and the study of <strong>fermentation</strong> and <strong>digestion</strong>.
  - <strong>Glauber</strong>: Focuses on practical applications and <strong>salt-based experiments</strong>.
  
- <strong>Rivals:</strong> As the player advances, they can encounter rival alchemists who may sabotage their experiments, steal resources, or challenge them to alchemical duels. These rivals are inspired by historical figures who had competing theories.

#### <strong>b. Elemental Balance System</strong>
- Players need to maintain the <strong>balance</strong> of elements in their lab and experiments. For example, using too much <strong>fire</strong> (sulfur) without balancing it with <strong>mercury</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> may cause the experiment to fail or result in a disaster. This system is based on the <strong>tria prima</strong> theory of balancing the elements of <strong>body, spirit, and soul</strong>.

#### <strong>c. Mystical Influence and Occult Studies</strong>
- While the game focuses on <strong>scientific alchemy</strong>, there can be optional <strong>mystical</strong> paths where players delve deeper into <strong>occult alchemy</strong>, allowing them to explore more esoteric practices. These paths could offer rare ingredients or powers but at a higher risk of failure or disaster.
  - Example: &quot;Homunculus Creation&quot; – A mystical experiment where players attempt to create a homunculus, a small artificial lifeform. This process is dangerous and has a high risk of failure, but successful creation gives the player a powerful assistant in the lab.

---

### <strong>5. Visual and Audio Design</strong>

#### <strong>a. Alchemical Symbols and Visual Style</strong>
- The game should have a <strong>dark, mystical atmosphere</strong>, with intricate <strong>alchemical symbols</strong> glowing subtly on the walls of the lab or on equipment. As the player conducts experiments, <strong>magical glyphs</strong> could appear, indicating the mystical nature of alchemy’s early theories.

#### <strong>b. Interactive Equipment</strong>
- All lab equipment should be <strong>interactive</strong>, allowing players to rotate retorts, control furnace heat, pour liquids into crucibles, or grind materials into powder. The equipment reacts dynamically to the player&#x27;s inputs, creating a tactile feel for the experiments.

#### <strong>c. Immersive Sound Design</strong>
- Each experiment has its own <strong>sound effects</strong>, such as the bubbling of liquids, the crackling of fire in the furnace, or the hiss of a gas leak. When an experiment goes wrong, loud <strong>shattering glass</strong> or the sound of an explosion will alert players to disaster.
  
---

### <strong>6. Narrative Elements</strong>

- <strong>Historical Storylines:</strong> The game can have a <strong>story mode</strong> where the player follows different <strong>historical quests</strong> inspired by real alchemists’ goals. For instance, the player could work for a medieval monarch trying to transmute metals into gold, or they might be asked to create healing potions during a plague outbreak.
- <strong>Mystery and Discovery:</strong> Throughout the game, players can uncover <strong>hidden manuscripts</strong>, <strong>secrets of ancient alchemy</strong>, and <strong>lost formulas</strong> that open up new possibilities for experimentation. The</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div> mystery of <strong>spiritual transformation</strong> versus <strong>scientific discovery</strong> is woven into the narrative, giving the game depth.
