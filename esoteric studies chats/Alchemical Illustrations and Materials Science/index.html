Van Utrecht\u2019s objects have another point in common:\none way or the other they are produced through the agency of fire. Van Utrecht\u2019s\npainting celebrates Antwerp\u2019s economic power and the productive ingenuity of its\ncraftsmen and artists as much as it praises the transformative force of fire turning\nrelatively cheap and humble materials into highly valued objects of art. These\nobjects were all products of the arts of fire, which according to Vannoccio\nBiringuccio (1480\u2013c.1539) included alchemy, and excluded \u201cfalse alchemy\u201d\nconcerned with pretentious transmutation.2\nIn the background of Van Utrecht\u2019s painting, a window opens on to a space in\nwhich a man stands working at a stove with an open fire. Stirring a cauldron, the\nman is shown in the material company of bellows, an anvil, a melting and a\ndistilling furnace, and other equipment related to the worlds of assaying and\nmetallurgy. Van Utrecht\u2019s background refers to the spaces in which the objects in\nthe foreground were produced. Were these spaces laboratories or artisanal workshops? Were they home to gold- and silversmiths, glassmakers or producers of\nporcelain? The difference between workshops and laboratories during this period is\nambiguous, not only in Van Utrecht\u2019s depiction, and the line between the two\nspaces is as difficult to draw as that between the arts of fire and alchemy.

Following Giorgio\nVasari (1511\u20131574), Karel van Mander (1548\u20131606) portrayed Van Eyck as an\nalchemist and likened his invention of oil paint to alchemical experimentation.3\nAccording to Van Mander, Van Eyck experimented with varnishes and binding agents,\n\u201cand found after much investigation that pigments mixed with such oils became\nmalleable and dried hard, and having dried became impermeable, and that the oil\nmade colours livelier, and that they themselves became lustrous without varnishing.\u201d4\nIt turns out that Van Eyck did not invent oil paint, and neither was he an alchemist.\nNevertheless he would never have been described in those terms had not artists\nand alchemists both been considered agents of material transformation. Van\nMander\u2019s description of Van Eyck\u2019s experimentation also reminds us that painters\nand alchemists shared materials, and that painters used artificially created pigments,\n\u201cmade by alchemy\u201d according to Cennino Cennini (c.1370\u2013c.1440). However, this\n3\n4\nDavis, \u201cRenaissance Inventions.\u201d\nMander, Het schilder-boeck, 199v.

In the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the term laboratorium uniquely referred to workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed: smelting, combustion,\ndistillation, dissolution, and precipitation. Matteo Martelli has convincingly\nshown that no such term was available in Antiquity.5 The Papyri, containing recipes\nfor the production of a range of luxury goods, and the earliest texts on alchemy,\nused the terminology of specific crafts (dyeing, metalworking and glassmaking).\nWhile artisans labored in workshops with tools and ingredients specific to their\ncraft, alchemists seemed to have made use of a more complex set of materials,\ninstruments and techniques belonging to various crafts. However, Martelli also\nshows that even the earliest alchemists developed specialized equipment. This leads\nto the assumption that as early as the first century AD, alchemists in Hellenistic\nEgypt began to differentiate themselves from artisans. However, there was no\nworkplace specifically designed for alchemists to engage in their activities. It is\nlikely they accessed the material equipment in artisanal workshops.\nBy the early modern period, the alchemist had acquired a specific place of work.\nAccording to Pamela Smith, by the mid-sixteenth century, these laboratories were\nreferred to formally as laboratorium and officina.6 The ubiquity of furnaces and the\nuse of fire demanded a specific workplace, whereas experimental philosophy still\nlacked specific places of experimentation in the seventeenth century. Laboratories\nwere associated with secretive practices. When in the early seventeenth century\nAndreas Libavius described the ideal workplace of the chemist, he emphasized how\nit differed from the dark, smelly, secretive laboratory that was noticeably lacking in\ndecorum:\nWe do not want the chemist to neglect the exercises of piety or exempt himself from other\nduties of an upright life, simply pining away amidst his dark furnaces [. . .]. Thus we are not\ngoing to devise from him just a chymeion or laboratory to use as a private study and\nhideaway in order that his practice will be more distinguished than anyone else\u2019s; but\nrather, what we shall provide for him is a dwelling suitable for decorous participation in\nsociety and living the life of a free man [. . .].7\n5\nMartelli, \u201cGreek Alchemists at Work.\u201d\nSmith, \u201cLaboratories,\u201d 299.\n7\nLibavius, \u201cCommentariorum alchymiae.\u201d Quoted and translated in Hannaway, \u201cLaboratory\nDesign,\u201d 599.

The material\nculture supporting this laboratory work remained largely unchanged. The exception\nis the material equipment for transmutational alchemy and the making of the\nPhilosophers\u2019 Stone, which generally disappeared from laboratories together with\ntransmutational alchemy itself in the eighteenth century. Laboratories were places\nin which the study of nature and technical innovation went hand in hand.\nAs already mentioned, the term \u201claboratory\u201d was not only used to refer to the\nworkplace of the alchemist. All workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nperformed were known as laboratories, and as such, artisanal workshops with\nfurnaces and fire in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed were also\nknown as laboratories. For example, the places in which sixteenth-century producers of fireworks developed their materials were called laboratories.9 In terms of\nmaterial culture the laboratorium, for example, one designed and equipped by\nCount Wolfgang II von Hohenlohe-Weidersheim (1546\u20131610) in the early seventeenth century, was remarkably similar to the workplaces of apothecaries, metalworkers and glassmakers.10\nBefore the emergence of mercantilist states, Renaissance courts were the most\nimportant agents in establishing laboratories. The laboratories of Rudolf II (1552\u2013\n1612) in Prague and Landgrave Moritz von Hessen-Kassel (1572\u20131632) were\nthought to bring material and intellectual rewards.11 Moritz even founded a chair\nof chymiatria at the University of Marburg in 1609.12 The teaching of Johannes\nHartmann (1561\u20131631), who was appointed to the chair, included work in the\nlaboratory, likewise established at the university. Courts also developed workplaces\nin which the work of artisans could be tested. Most famously, in the 1670s, Johann\nJoachim Becher (1635\u20131682) proposed the establishment of a Kunst- und\nWerckhaus at the court in Vienna.13 It would have included several different sorts\nof manufactures: porcelain making, silk and wool weaving, the production of\nmedicines and glassmaking. Chemical laboratories were to form the core of the\n8\nKlein, \u201cLaboratory Challenge,\u201d and \u201cApothecary Shops.\u201d For the dissociation of experimental\nphilosophy from the alchemical laboratory, see Shapin, \u201cHouse of Experiment.\u201d\n9\nWerrett, Fireworks, 29\u201330.\n10\nWeyer, Graf Wolfgang II. von Hohenlohe.

These laboratories were intended to specialize in salts and acids used in the\nproduction of mineral dyes. Becher envisioned that the manufacture and export of\nthese dyes would finance the other operations of the Kunst- und Werckhaus. He also\nenvisaged the house attracting artisans from various crafts and that it would\nfunction as a deposit of recipes and descriptions of techniques. Trained artisans\nwould then be sent out to distribute new processes, new manufactures and inventions. Becher used alchemy to intrigue his patron, who was always interested in the\nwealth promised by metallic transmutation, and to link the worlds of the court and\ncommerce.\nSuch court projects often took inspiration from the two earliest examples of\nspaces bringing together alchemy and the decorative arts at the Medici court in\nFlorence. Two essays in this volume deal with these Florentine workplaces: Fanny\nKieffer discusses the Uffizi, and Marco Beretta the Casino di San Marco. Founded\nin 1586 by Francesco I de\u2019 Medici (1541\u20131587), and developed by his successor,\nFerdinando I (1549\u20131609), the Uffizi housed the fonderia, a workspace for the arts\nof fire. Here medicines were prepared and metals fused. The fonderia was simultaneously a pharmacy, an alchemical laboratory, a smithy, a goldsmith\u2019s workshop,\nand a confectionary. The activities performed in the Uffizi included everything from\npreparing jams and sugar sculptures to the production of glass and fireworks (and\nless peaceful applications of saltpeter). Francesco I also established the Casino di\nSan Marco. It included an alchemical laboratory, a furnace for producing porcelain,\nand a glass workshop in which, under the direction of Niccolo Sisti, cristallo\n(so named because it was as clear as rock crystal) was made, as well as all sorts\nof colored glass in imitation of precious stones. Other important activities in the\nCasino were the fusion of rock crystal, the counterfeiting of precious stones, the\nproduction of fireworks, and the preparation of pharmaceutical remedies. Similar\nactivities were developed in the Uffizi and the Casino, and recipes and personnel\ntravelled between the two places. The only exception was Medici porcelain, which\nwas exclusively produced in the workshops of the Casino.\nIn sum, Renaissance courts established spaces where artisanal workshops and\nlaboratories were brought together facilitating the circulation of materials, people\nand knowledge between the worlds of craft (today\u2019s decorative arts) and alchemy.\nArt Technologies and Knowledge of Material Transformation\nLaboratories were not only the workplaces of transmutational alchemists. The Uffizi\nand the Casino had little in common with the workplaces of alleged goldmakers\ndestined to fail and bring their families to financial ruin, as famously depicted by\nPieter Brueghel the Elder (c.1525\u20131569) (Fig. 2). Just as the spaces known as\nlaboratories encompassed the workplaces of artisans laboring at furnaces and\n\nPages 13:\nxii\nIntroduction\nFig. 2 Pieter Brueghel the Elder, The Alchemist\u2019s Family: Al-gemist, 1558 (Courtesy of the\nKupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)\nusing materials and chemical procedures to make both everyday items and objects\nof the visual and decorative arts, the activity known as alchemy encompassed more\nthan attempts to make gold.14 Transmutational alchemy was about the transmutation of all base metals into more noble ones, but chrysopoeia was only one\naspect of alchemy. Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture.\nIt was about the chemical production of things\u2014medicines, porcelain, dyes, and\nother products as well as the precious metals\u2014and about the knowledge of how to\nproduce them. In this sense, \u201cart technologies\u201d\u2014materials and techniques to make\nart and knowledge of these materials and techniques\u2014overlapped with alchemy.\nAlchemy has deep roots in writings on material transformation from Antiquity.\nThe productive knowledge associated with material transformation was written\ndown in recipe books. The Leiden and Stockholm Papyri date to the third century\nAD. They contain recipes for the making of gold and silver, for the imitation of\nprecious stones, and for textile dyes. Whether a recipe is about coloring silver to\nmake it look like gold or the making of an imitation ruby or another artificial\nprecious stone, all of the recipes in the Papyri are, indeed, about material transformation and color change as related to the manufacture of luxury goods. As\nMatteo Martelli shows in this volume, relatively early on a historical process of\nselection, appropriation and differentiation resulted in a more limited definition of\n14\nFor the scope of early modern alchemy and the notion of \u2018chymistry\u2019, see Principe, Secrets of\nAlchemy; and Newman &amp; Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. Chemistry.\u201d\n\nPages 14:\nIntroduction\nxiii\nalchemy primarily focused on the making of gold and silver. Already around\n300 AD, a distinction was introduced between a limited definition of alchemy as\nmetallic transmutation and a more encompassing definition including productive\nknowledge and various artisanal technologies.\nTransmitted to Europe, and translated into Latin and the vernaculars, several of\nthe recipes in the Papyri are still found in collections of recipes in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries. More importantly, as Martelli remarks in his essay, the scope of\na recipe collection such as the Mappae clavicula, compiled between the ninth and\nthe twelfth centuries, is as encompassing as that of the Papyri despite the earlier\nattempts to limit alchemy to metallic transmutation only. It should not come as a\nsurprise then that Sylvie Neven finds it difficult to demarcate between alchemical\nand art technological recipes in late medieval collections of recipes. Her contribution to this volume shows that alchemical and art technological recipes shared a\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art\ntechnology was crucial to the polemics of artists and alchemists and the rivalry\nbetween alchemy and the arts.16 Given the contested nature of the field of inquiry,\nit follows that the identity of the alchemist was equally contested and complex. In\nthe early modern period the alchemist was often portrayed as a fraud. The portrayals\nof laboratory scenes building on Brueghel became a genre of its own in the\nNetherlands.17 In these scenes, the alchemist is a goldmaker searching in vain for\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone and riches. As Tara Nummedal has convincingly shown,\nthe portrayal of the alchemist as a fraud also created the opportunity for other\nalchemists to fashion themselves in the role of experts, offering their services to\ncourts and other patrons to help them unmask fraudulent alchemists.18 Alchemical\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15\nFor reading and writing as alchemical practices, see Nummedal, \u201cWords and Works,\u201d and the\nliterature quoted there.\n16\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, 115\u201363.\n17\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations, 11\u201327.\n18\nFor experts and entrepreneurial alchemy, see Nummedal, Alchemy and Authority, 40\u20135.\n\nPages 15:\nxiv\nIntroduction\nIt is in this context of alchemical expertise that we should consider the artisans\nwho adopted the language of alchemy in the early modern period to attract the\nattention of patrons. One example can be seen in the description of Black Berthold,\nthe legendary discoverer of gunpowder in Europe, in the late fifteenth-century\nmanuscript Feuerwerckbuch. Depicted in the company of a furnace and alembics,\nBerthold\u2019s creation of ordnance is identified with alchemy. Black Berthold, the\nFeuerwerckbuch reads,\nworked with the great alchemy like those masters who are engaged with precious and\nvaluable things, with silver and gold, and with similar metals. These masters can separate\nsilver and gold from other precious jewelry, and from other valuable colors which they can\nproduce. Now this master Berthold wanted to induce a golden coloration. For this he used\nsalpetre, sulphur, lead and oil. Then he put these ingredients in a container made of copper,\nwhich he sealed completely, exactly as it should be done, but when he put it on fire and the\ncontainer became hot, it burst into many pieces.19\nThe Feuerwerckbuch witnesses material production based on practical chemistry in\nterms borrowed from alchemical transmutation, or more precisely, the making of\ngold. The analogy was not always with chrysopoeia as such. Vasari\u2019s already\nmentioned fashioning of Van Eyck as an alchemist shows that the image of alchemy\nas a field of expert inquiry on materials and material transformation was considered\nsufficiently positive to identify with. However, we should not forget that Vasari\u2019s\nidentification of Van Eyck as an alchemist served the purpose of downplaying\nNetherlandish art as techne, only a first step in a narrative of art historical progress\nculminating in Vasari\u2019s beloved Florentine art.\nThe epistemic value of techne was shifting at the time of Vasari. Artisans came\nto be considered experts of nature likening the artisanal processes of material\ntransformation undertaken in their workshops to those of nature.20 As Andrea\nBernardoni shows in this volume, Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia is part of this larger\nprocess of shifting epistemic value of artisanal processes. Rejecting transmutational\nalchemy as \u201cfalse\u201d and the alchemists who practiced it as fraudulent, Biringuccio\ncarved out space for true alchemy as one of the arts of fire. Artisanal workshops,\nsuch as Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (c.1435\u20131488) in which Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u2013\n1519) apprenticed or Leonardo\u2019s own workplace, shared a material culture with\nalchemical laboratories. As we have already pointed out, artisans used similar\nequipment and performed \u201cchemical\u201d operations. However, Bernardoni argues,\nBiringuccio made the claim that these artisans were the true experts on matter,\nmaterials and material transformation and that artisanal \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nthe key to natural knowledge.\nOne of the readers of Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia was Johannes Mathesius (1504\u2013\n1565), a Lutheran preacher in St. Joachimsthal, the center of an important mining\ndistrict. In her contribution to this volume, Henrike Haug analyzes Mathesius\u2019s\n19\nHassenstein, Das Feuerwerckbuch, 45\u20136. For translation and discussion, see Werrett,\nFireworks, 28.\n20\nSmith, Body of the Artisan. esp. 95\u2013127.\n\nPages 16:\nIntroduction\nxv\nsermons to reveal conceptions of the origin and formation of ores for which\nMathesius drew equally on natural philosophy and alchemy and on the artisanal\nknowledge of the local miners and goldsmiths. Following one of the goldsmiths\u2019\nmost prized objects, a so-called Handstein, into the Kunstkammer, Haug shows that\nthis knowledge also reached elite collectors. They valued Handsteine for the\nmetallogenetic knowledge they embodied, thereby endorsing the shifting epistemic\nstatus of the arts.\nEpistemic Changes Between Artisans and Alchemists\nBiringuccio and Mathesius\u2019s St. Joachimsthal are examples of persons and places\nof exchange between scholarly cultures (in which learning is based on reading and\nwriting) and artisanal cultures (in which learning is based on doing).21 The laboratories created in Medici Florence, discussed in the chapters by Kieffer and\nBeretta, were also early examples of such places of exchange, followed by many\nother European courts. These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and\nworkshops. In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures. By the seventeenth century, the expertise of some glassmakers,\nsilver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of\nalchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the\nlaboratory.24 Lawrence Principe and Morgan Wesley discuss two examples of\nsuch arts: silversmithing and porcelain production, respectively.\n21\nFor \u2018trading zones\u2019 between artisanal and scholarly cultures, see Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23\nOn hybrid experts, see Klein, \u201cArtisanal-Scientific Experts,\u201d and \u201cDepersonalizing the Arcanum.\u201d\n24\nFor glassmaking (not discussed here), see Beretta, Alchemy of Glass; and Dupre\u0301, \u201cValue of\nGlass.\u201d\n22\n\nPages 17:\nxvi\nIntroduction\nSilver- and goldsmiths seem obvious candidates when we think of careers that\ncross artisan and alchemist. Silversmiths, goldsmiths and alchemists worked on the\nsame materials (silver and gold), and silver- and goldsmiths\u2019 expertise was called\nfor to assay the purported gold and silver transmuted by alchemists. Silver- and\ngoldsmiths could also become involved themselves in transmutational endeavours.\nIn his contribution to this book, Principe focuses on the brothers Anthoni and\nAndries Grill (1604\u20131655) as examples of such hybrid figures. They ran successful\nsilversmithing businesses in mid-seventeenth century Amsterdam and The Hague.\nAnthoni Grill\u2019s Amsterdam laboratory also produced work on transmutation for\nwhich he gained some notoriety. Moreover, Grill\u2019s work on chymistry was not only\nbased on learning by doing; he is reported to have read Paracelsus and Glauber.\nGrill moved between artisanal and scholarly worlds and between learning by doing\nand by reading. Both came together in his laboratory in Amsterdam.\nIn the final chapter of this book, Wesley investigates the production of porcelain\nin the seventeenth century. The potter\u2019s art remained outside the canon of the\ndecorative arts until the emergence of the trade of luxury pottery ware in the\nfifteenth century and Biringuccio\u2019s inclusion of pottery among the arts of fire in\nthe sixteenth century. Although (as already mentioned) the Medici sought to imitate\nthe porcelain imported from China in the Casino, European hard-paste porcelain,\nalmost identical to that of China, was due to the efforts of seventeenth-century\nchymists who were both at home in the artisanal world of pottery and in the learned\nworld, according to Wesley. His chapter highlights John Dwight (1633\u20131704),\ntrained in Robert Boyle\u2019s (1627\u20131691) laboratory and apt with excellent language\nskills, and Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708), mathematician and\ndirector of the Dresden court laboratory of the Saxon Elector Friedrich August I\n(1670\u20131733).25 Tschirnhaus collaborated with the alchemist and apothecary Johann\nFriedrich Bo\u0308ttger (1682\u20131719), also involved in transmutational endeavors at the\nDresden court, towards the production of porcelain. In the first porcelain manufactory in Meissen, established by the Elector in his castle Albrechtsburg in 1710,\nBo\u0308ttger was the expert overseeing the manufacturing process, knowledgeable in\nchemistry and skilled in porcelain production. Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds. The rise of\nthese hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of laboratories in\nwhich art technologies and alchemy were brought together, the first of these being\nat Renaissance courts. Laboratories and artisanal workshops shared a material\n25\nSee also Pietsch, \u201cTschirnhaus,\u201d and Klein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n\nPages 18:\nIntroduction\nxvii\nculture. In fact, in the early modern period, they were often so similar in terms of the\ninstruments they contained that they carried the same name. This material culture\nremained largely the same. A change took place at another level: the increasing\npresence of books and texts in laboratories and workshops populated by figures who\nmerged artisanal and scholarly cultures. This book suggests that this shift in\nworkshop culture facilitated the epistemic exchanges between alchemists and producers of the decorative arts.\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was conceived and written in dialogue with an exhibition project \u201cArt\nand Alchemy. The Mystery of Transformation.\u201d The exhibition is on view at the\nMuseum Kunstpalast in Du\u0308sseldorf from April to August 2014. I would like to\nthank my co-curators of the show, Dedo von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk (director of the\nGlasmuseum Hentrich in Du\u0308sseldorf and the initiator of the exhibition project) and\nLawrence Principe, for their inspiration, sound advice, and help with almost every\nsingle step in the process of making this book. Without them, the book would have\nbeen very different, and more importantly, far below the quality of the present\nresult. The exhibition project in Du\u0308sseldorf was a constant inspiration, many thanks\nto the exhibition team and the curator of the modern part of the show, general\ndirector of the Museum Kunstpalast Beat Wismer, who all contributed to making\nthe project such an intellectually rewarding experience.\nWe worked towards this book during several smaller meetings and one larger\nconference hosted at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in March\n2013. Although this book contains only a selection of the papers presented at this\nconference, I would like to thank all presenters as well as all commentators and\ndiscussants for their contributions before during and after the conference.

Which kinds of techniques and craft\npractices does it encompass? And what were its goals? The paper addresses these\nquestions by investigating the earliest Greek alchemical texts preserved both in\nByzantine and in Syriac manuscripts. Already during the first centuries AD, in the\nGraeco-Roman Egypt it is possible to recognize some disagreement over the\ndefinition of alchemy and its expected outcomes. On the one hand, ps.Democritus\u2019s four books and the Leiden and Stockholm papyri support a fourfold\ndivision of alchemy including processes for making gold, silver, and precious\nstones (glass working included), and for dyeing wool purple. On the other hand,\nIsis\u2019s treatise focuses only on the making of precious metals, which is identified\nwith the main goal of alchemy during the late Byzantine tradition. In the process\nthat led to such a simplification of the technical background of alchemy Zosimus\u2019s\nwork seems to represent an important turning point. In fact the author inherited the\nabove mentioned polarity and discussed different ideas of alchemy in a key text\n(here edited and translated into English for the first time) on the revelation of\nalchemy based on the Enochian myth of the fallen angels.\nAlchemy and the Making of Gold: An Overview\nof the Byzantine Tradition\nBetween the seventh and the eleventh century different people\u2014including imperators, caliphs, and scholars moved by antiquarian curiosities\u2014became interested in\nche\u0304meia (alchemy) and somehow identified this art with chrysopoeia (the making\nof gold) and argyropoeia (the making of silver). Sure enough, these people were not\npractitioners and they did not test the techniques described by alchemical recipes.\nM.

Martelli\nHowever, if we consider that the Byzantine anthologies preserving most of the\nGreek and Byzantine alchemical writings were probably compiled from the seventh\ncentury onwards, we should wonder to what extent a similar attitude could have\naffected the selection of the works transmitted by these collections.1 Did such a\nfocus on the making of precious metals influence the choice of the treatises to be\nincluded into Byzantine anthologies and translated into Syriac and Arabic?\nAlthough a complete answer to this question would surpass the aim of this chapter\nand would require a wider analysis of the hundreds of alchemical manuscripts\nnowadays kept in several European and Middle-Eastern libraries, in the following I\nfocus my attention especially on the polarity between the idea of alchemy as\nchrysopoeia attested by Byzantine scholars and a broader interest in different\ndyeing techniques attested by the most ancient alchemical writings (first to fourth\ncentury AD). Some of these works, in fact, covered a wider set of techniques\nfocusing not only on how to dye metals yellow and white (that is, how to transform\nthem into gold and silver), but also on how to dye crystal quartz different colours in\norder to produce precious stones, and how to dye wool purple.\nIn mid-eleventh century Constantinople, the Byzantine scholar Michael Psellos\n(1018\u2013c.1078) composed a small treatise on the making of gold in the form of a\nletter addressed to the Patriarch Michael I Cerularius (1043\u20131059), who asked the\nphilosopher to make an investigation on the ancient alchemical methods of\n\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1 (chrysopoeia). After some theoretical remarks, Psellos introduced\nand somehow justified the specific focus of his small treatise as follows (Letter\non the Making of Gold, \u00a7 5 partim):\nSince in my preface I have already insisted enough on the fact that transformations of\nmatter happen according to natural changes, and not by means of magic spells, miracles, or\nsome other secret practice (so, we must not wonder), it is time to pass on to this art of\ntransformation. I would have liked to compose a complete discourse on this art and on how\nto work the matters [. . .] and to teach what makes quartz and sapphire porous, what\nproduces a fake emerald and beryl, which nature can soften stones, which one can dilute\npearls and make them watery, and which one can make then again solid and round, and how\nto whiten them [. . .] However, since you [Michael Cerularius] do not allow me to delay\nwith such superfluous inquiries, wasting all my studiousness in a worthless research, but\nyou want me to examine with which substances and according to which scientific method\ngold may be produced, I am going to explain only this topic.2\n1\nSee Mertens, \u201cGreco-Egyptian Alchemy,\u201d 220\u20135.\nEdition by Bidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 30, 16\u201331, 9: \u201c\u1f18\u03c0\u03b5\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u1f31\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\n\u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f31 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03be \u1f10\u03c0\u1ff3\u03b4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\n\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u1ff6 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2\n\u1f22 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03b4\u03b9\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae), \u1f10\u03c0\u2019 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f22\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb~\n\u03b7\u03c2. \u1f18\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bbo\u0301\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f51\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, [. . .] \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03be\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03af \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd, \u03c4\u03af \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd\n\u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f21 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1&lt;

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>This book, *Laboratories of Art: Alchemy and Art Technology from Antiquity to the 18th Century*, provides a comprehensive look at the intersections between alchemy, materials science, and artisanal knowledge, particularly focusing on how alchemists contributed to the development of art materials. The book examines how laboratories in Renaissance Europe became spaces where artisans and alchemists collaborated on the creation of pigments, dyes, glass, porcelain, and other decorative arts. Alchemy was seen not just as a mystical pursuit, but also as a practical science that could improve and innovate the processes behind art production.

### Key Themes:

1. <strong>Alchemy’s Role in Material Transformation:</strong>
   Alchemists were regarded as experts in material transformation, not just in the pursuit of transmuting metals into gold but also in the creation of pigments, ceramics, and glass. For example, the Renaissance artisan Jan van Eyck’s invention of oil paints, often likened to alchemy, shows how painters and alchemists shared techniques to transform base materials into valuable artistic mediums. [Laboratories of Art, page 9](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=9).

2. <strong>Workshops and Laboratories:</strong>
   In the 15th and 16th centuries, artisanal workshops and alchemical laboratories were closely intertwined. These spaces were used not only for metallurgical processes like smelting and assaying but also for the creation of dyes, ceramics, and glass—industries that would significantly influence Renaissance art. The merging of alchemical and artisanal knowledge led to technological innovations that improved material quality and introduced new artistic techniques. [Laboratories of Art, page 11](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=11).

3. <strong>Artisanal and Alchemical Knowledge Sharing:</strong>
   Courts like the Medici&#x27;s in Florence fostered collaboration between artisans and alchemists, promoting the circulation of techniques and materials. Laboratories in courts became centers for experimenting with porcelain production, glassmaking, and metallurgy. The knowledge from these artisanal processes helped develop not only luxury goods but also scientific methods. [Laboratories of Art, page 13](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13).

### Choice Quotes:

- &quot;Van Mander’s description of Van Eyck’s experimentation reminds us that painters and alchemists shared materials, and that painters used artificially created pigments, &#x27;made by alchemy&#x27; according to Cennino Cennini.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 9](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=9)
  
- &quot;Laboratories were places in which the study of nature and technical innovation went hand in hand. The making of medicines, porcelain, and other products, as well as precious metals, shows that &#x27;art technologies&#x27; overlapped with alchemy.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 12](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=12)

Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 901:\nKimiya, the dark stone. It is the work of the art of gold and silver.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool.

Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for. He longed for it, but I did not give\nmyself and I was able to curb his desire until he showed me his mark on the head and\nrevealed all the mysteries I was looking for, without envy and faithfully.23\nThe \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 (Egyptian holy art) quoted at the beginning of the\npassage is clearly identified by Isis with \u1f21 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae\nI have followed the more recent edition by Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 128\u201331: \u201c\u1f3c\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6~\n\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff7\n\u03c5\u1f31\u1ff7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u1ff3. \u1f08\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f66 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03c5\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76\n\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1o\u0301\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 &lt;\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2&gt; \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, &lt;. . .&gt; \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5,\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03b8\u03b1 \u1f31\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1o\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137. The three recipes that have been edited correspond\nwith the texts translated or summarized by Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 223 (rec. 2), 224\u20135 (rec. 8\u2013\n9), 225 (rec. 12); and Giumlia-Mair, \u201cZosimos the Alchemist,\u201d 319\u201321.\n43\nSee, for example, Giumlia-Mair, \u201cKrokodil.\u201d\n\nPages 40:\n16\nM. Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions. Presented in the form of a succession of more or less short notes, these\nS.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 28 to page 48 out of a total of 220.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool. For instance, the alchemist\nSynesius (fourth century AD), who wrote a commentary on ps.-Democritus\u2019s\n11\nSee (a) the fourth part of the Zuqn\u0131\u0304q Chronicle or Chronicle of ps.-Dyonisus of Tell-Mahre,\nedited by Chabot, Pseudo-Dyonysianum, 66; (b) the chronicle of Michael the Syrian, edited by\nChabot, Michel le Syrien, 474; (c) the anonymous chronicle edited by Brooks, \u201cSyriac Fragment,\u201d\n217\u20138.\n12\nFor instance, the story is told by the geographer Ibn al-Faq\u0131\u0304h al-Hamadani (Goeje, Ibn al-Faq\u0003{n\nal-Hamada\u0304n\u0003{, 137\u20139; French transl. by Masse\u0301, Abre\u0301ge\u0301 du Livre de Pays,\u02d9 164\u20136); see Strohmaier,\n\u00af Hamza,\u201d 21\u20132.\n\u201cUma\u0304ra ibn\n\u02d9\n13\nBidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 40,7\u20138: \u201c\u03a4\u03af \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd; \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\u201d\n\nPages 30:\n6\nM. Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for. He longed for it, but I did not give\nmyself and I was able to curb his desire until he showed me his mark on the head and\nrevealed all the mysteries I was looking for, without envy and faithfully.23\nThe \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 (Egyptian holy art) quoted at the beginning of the\npassage is clearly identified by Isis with \u1f21 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae\nI have followed the more recent edition by Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 128\u201331: \u201c\u1f3c\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6~\n\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff7\n\u03c5\u1f31\u1ff7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u1ff3. \u1f08\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f66 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03c5\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76\n\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1o\u0301\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 &lt;\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2&gt; \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, &lt;. . .&gt; \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5,\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03b8\u03b1 \u1f31\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1o\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137.

Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its transformation.5 In the practical sense, one of the main goals of alchemy is the transmutation\n1\nThe main data and characteristics of these manuscripts are given in Appendix.\nBrewer, Fr. Rogeri Bacon, 39\u201340.\n3\nPerception and definition of alchemy is not chronologically constant and has been the subject of\nseveral (re)interpretations since the eighteenth century, see Principe &amp; Newman, \u201cHistoriography\nof Alchemy.\u201d\n4\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 336\u20137; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate,\u201d 432\u20133; Pereira,\n\u201cUse of Vernacular Languages,\u201d 336; and Kahn, Alchimie et paracelsisme, 7\u20138.\n5\nHalleux, Savoir de la main, 134.\n2\n\nPages 49:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n25\nof base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into a noble or perfect one.6 To do\nso, alchemists used to perform chemical processes and manipulations which resembled those practiced by contemporary artists and artisans.\nThus, in both fields particular importance is placed on craft practices. Both\nalchemical and artistic recipe books describe various processes for purifying and\ntransforming materials, either for improving their properties or in order to use them\nfor specific purposes. In this context, from a technological point of view, the term\n\u2018transmutation\u2019 could refer to the colouring of glass, the melting and tinting of\nmetals, the dyeing of stones or gems, or the manufacture of synthetic pigments. A\nhuge number of recipes are dedicated to procedures for obtaining gold or silver or\ngold-silver like substances from base metals (copper, tin, lead, iron, mercury).\nThe tradition of recipe books has roots deep in Antiquity. Treatises dealing both\nwith art-technological and alchemical procedures notably survived in the Alexandrian Greek papyri preserved in Leyden and Stockholm.7 These date from the third\ncentury but were probably based on previous texts.8 These papyri contain information on the imitation of precious materials such as gold, gems and Tyrian purple.\nThey also have recipes dedicated to the art of dyeing, to chrysography, and to the\nmaking of artificial precious stones.\nAn echo of these recipes can be found in the Codex Lucensis 490 (Lucca,\nBiblioteca Capitolare Felinia\u0300na), also known as the Compositiones ad tingenda\nmusiva or Compositiones variae. This manuscript, dated from the end of the eighth\nor the very beginning of the ninth century, is based on previous Greek sources\ncompiled around the beginning of the seventh century.9 This recipe book deals with\nvarious artistic techniques, notably the dyeing of skins, the manufacture of pigments, colorants, varnishes and glues, chrysography and the gilding of metals.\nThe Lucca Manuscript shares content with the Mappae clavicula, compiled\naround 800. Parts of this text have far earlier origins and present parallels\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 29 to page 49 out of a total of 220.

Martelli\nEmpire, the same definition had been already given by the Persian scholar al-Nad\u0131\u0304m\n(ninth century AD), who devoted the tenth chapter of his Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist (Book of\nCatalogue) to the sina\u0304\u2018at al-k\u0131\u0304m\u0131\u0304ya\u0304\u2019 (art of alchemy): at the very beginning of the\nchapter this art is\u02d9 defined again as \u201cthe making of gold and silver from other\nmetals.\u201d8 More than one century later, the Syriac scholar Bar Bahlul (eleventh\ncentury AD) dealt with the same subject in two entries of his lexicon:\n1. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 901:\nKimiya, the dark stone. It is the work of the art of gold and silver. And there is\nsomeone who explains this word from the name kima (the constellation of the\nPleiades), that is the height stars, because (this art) is accomplished by means of\nthe height mixtures.9\n2. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol.

The two precious metals\nwere probably the most attractive outcomes that anyone engaged in alchemical\npractices tried to achieve out of this art, as is possible to infer from a few accounts\non alchemists preserved by Byzantine and Syriac chronographers. In the mid-sixth\ncentury, for instance, John Malalas (491\u2013578) reported the story of John Istmeos,\n\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (alchemist and tremendous impostor),\nwho moved from Antioch to Constantinople, where he was condemned by the\nemperor Anastasios (491\u2013518) because of the adulterated gold objects he tried to\n8\nI have quoted the translation proposed by Dodge (The Fihrist, 841), who checked several\nmanuscripts (see pp. xxiii\u2013xxxiv) not taken into account by Flu\u0308gel, who edited the Arabic text.\nIn Flu\u0308gel\u2019s edition (Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist, vol.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool. For instance, the alchemist\nSynesius (fourth century AD), who wrote a commentary on ps.-Democritus\u2019s\n11\nSee (a) the fourth part of the Zuqn\u0131\u0304q Chronicle or Chronicle of ps.-Dyonisus of Tell-Mahre,\nedited by Chabot, Pseudo-Dyonysianum, 66; (b) the chronicle of Michael the Syrian, edited by\nChabot, Michel le Syrien, 474; (c) the anonymous chronicle edited by Brooks, \u201cSyriac Fragment,\u201d\n217\u20138.\n12\nFor instance, the story is told by the geographer Ibn al-Faq\u0131\u0304h al-Hamadani (Goeje, Ibn al-Faq\u0003{n\nal-Hamada\u0304n\u0003{, 137\u20139; French transl. by Masse\u0301, Abre\u0301ge\u0301 du Livre de Pays,\u02d9 164\u20136); see Strohmaier,\n\u00af Hamza,\u201d 21\u20132.\n\u201cUma\u0304ra ibn\n\u02d9\n13\nBidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 40,7\u20138: \u201c\u03a4\u03af \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd; \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\u201d\n\nPages 30:\n6\nM. Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

Martelli\nthat hands down the above-mentioned recipe book on precious stones preserves\nanother important treatise that introduces a new important element into the discussion. The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137. The three recipes that have been edited correspond\nwith the texts translated or summarized by Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 223 (rec. 2), 224\u20135 (rec. 8\u2013\n9), 225 (rec. 12); and Giumlia-Mair, \u201cZosimos the Alchemist,\u201d 319\u201321.\n43\nSee, for example, Giumlia-Mair, \u201cKrokodil.\u201d\n\nPages 40:\n16\nM. Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions. Presented in the form of a succession of more or less short notes, these\nS.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 28 to page 48 out of a total of 220.

- <strong>Chapter 4: Conclusions on Innovation and Decentralization</strong>  
  This chapter delves into how decentralization allows for greater innovation, using the metaphor of &quot;laboratories&quot; where new ideas can be tested and evaluated on a smaller scale. States or regions, when decentralized, can experiment with policies before broader application, allowing for the testing of new social, political, and technological advancements. The document argues that this is vital for adaptive growth and problem-solving across various levels of governance.

- <strong>Case Studies in Governance</strong>  
  A set of real-world examples is explored, demonstrating how different decentralized units have managed unique challenges and opportunities in education, healthcare, and environmental policies. These cases are highlighted as proving the adaptability of decentralized models to local needs while allowing broader lessons for the global stage.

- <strong>Role of Public and Private Sectors in Decentralized Innovation</strong>  
  The interaction between public governance and private sector innovation is examined. The balance between allowing private industry to experiment and ensuring that public policy serves its population is a key theme. These sectors often engage in partnerships that drive economic and technological growth.

- <strong>Chapter 5: Future Outlook and Policy Recommendations</strong>  
  The closing chapters offer recommendations for policymakers on fostering environments conducive to decentralized innovation. The text suggests reforms in governance structures, the fostering of public-private partnerships, and leveraging local talent and resources to solve national and global problems. The document emphasizes that both institutional and cultural support are necessary for successful innovation in decentralized systems.

These chapters build upon earlier discussions on decentralization, innovation, and the interaction between local and broader governance frameworks.

Martelli\nEmpire, the same definition had been already given by the Persian scholar al-Nad\u0131\u0304m\n(ninth century AD), who devoted the tenth chapter of his Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist (Book of\nCatalogue) to the sina\u0304\u2018at al-k\u0131\u0304m\u0131\u0304ya\u0304\u2019 (art of alchemy): at the very beginning of the\nchapter this art is\u02d9 defined again as \u201cthe making of gold and silver from other\nmetals.\u201d8 More than one century later, the Syriac scholar Bar Bahlul (eleventh\ncentury AD) dealt with the same subject in two entries of his lexicon:\n1. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 901:\nKimiya, the dark stone. It is the work of the art of gold and silver. And there is\nsomeone who explains this word from the name kima (the constellation of the\nPleiades), that is the height stars, because (this art) is accomplished by means of\nthe height mixtures.9\n2. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 904:\nKemela\u2019a, that is the alchemy (kimiya\u2019a) of the seven bodies and of the\nvarious natures; [it includes] arts such as goldsmith\u2019s art and copper, iron, and\nglass working.10\nOnly the last definition includes a wide set of techniques applied to different\nsubstances (among which glass is mentioned), while most of the above-quoted\ntexts identifies alchemy with the making of gold and silver. The two precious metals\nwere probably the most attractive outcomes that anyone engaged in alchemical\npractices tried to achieve out of this art, as is possible to infer from a few accounts\non alchemists preserved by Byzantine and Syriac chronographers. In the mid-sixth\ncentury, for instance, John Malalas (491\u2013578) reported the story of John Istmeos,\n\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (alchemist and tremendous impostor),\nwho moved from Antioch to Constantinople, where he was condemned by the\nemperor Anastasios (491\u2013518) because of the adulterated gold objects he tried to\n8\nI have quoted the translation proposed by Dodge (The Fihrist, 841), who checked several\nmanuscripts (see pp. xxiii\u2013xxxiv) not taken into account by Flu\u0308gel, who edited the Arabic text.\nIn Flu\u0308gel\u2019s edition (Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist, vol.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool. For instance, the alchemist\nSynesius (fourth century AD), who wrote a commentary on ps.-Democritus\u2019s\n11\nSee (a) the fourth part of the Zuqn\u0131\u0304q Chronicle or Chronicle of ps.-Dyonisus of Tell-Mahre,\nedited by Chabot, Pseudo-Dyonysianum, 66; (b) the chronicle of Michael the Syrian, edited by\nChabot, Michel le Syrien, 474; (c) the anonymous chronicle edited by Brooks, \u201cSyriac Fragment,\u201d\n217\u20138.\n12\nFor instance, the story is told by the geographer Ibn al-Faq\u0131\u0304h al-Hamadani (Goeje, Ibn al-Faq\u0003{n\nal-Hamada\u0304n\u0003{, 137\u20139; French transl. by Masse\u0301, Abre\u0301ge\u0301 du Livre de Pays,\u02d9 164\u20136); see Strohmaier,\n\u00af Hamza,\u201d 21\u20132.\n\u201cUma\u0304ra ibn\n\u02d9\n13\nBidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 40,7\u20138: \u201c\u03a4\u03af \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd; \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\u201d\n\nPages 30:\n6\nM. Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

Martelli\nthat hands down the above-mentioned recipe book on precious stones preserves\nanother important treatise that introduces a new important element into the discussion. The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137. The three recipes that have been edited correspond\nwith the texts translated or summarized by Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 223 (rec. 2), 224\u20135 (rec. 8\u2013\n9), 225 (rec. 12); and Giumlia-Mair, \u201cZosimos the Alchemist,\u201d 319\u201321.\n43\nSee, for example, Giumlia-Mair, \u201cKrokodil.\u201d\n\nPages 40:\n16\nM. Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions. Presented in the form of a succession of more or less short notes, these\nS.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 28 to page 48 out of a total of 220.

Van Utrecht\u2019s objects have another point in common:\none way or the other they are produced through the agency of fire. Van Utrecht\u2019s\npainting celebrates Antwerp\u2019s economic power and the productive ingenuity of its\ncraftsmen and artists as much as it praises the transformative force of fire turning\nrelatively cheap and humble materials into highly valued objects of art. These\nobjects were all products of the arts of fire, which according to Vannoccio\nBiringuccio (1480\u2013c.1539) included alchemy, and excluded \u201cfalse alchemy\u201d\nconcerned with pretentious transmutation.2\nIn the background of Van Utrecht\u2019s painting, a window opens on to a space in\nwhich a man stands working at a stove with an open fire.

Van Utrecht\u2019s background refers to the spaces in which the objects in\nthe foreground were produced. Were these spaces laboratories or artisanal workshops? Were they home to gold- and silversmiths, glassmakers or producers of\nporcelain? The difference between workshops and laboratories during this period is\nambiguous, not only in Van Utrecht\u2019s depiction, and the line between the two\nspaces is as difficult to draw as that between the arts of fire and alchemy.

Following Giorgio\nVasari (1511\u20131574), Karel van Mander (1548\u20131606) portrayed Van Eyck as an\nalchemist and likened his invention of oil paint to alchemical experimentation.3\nAccording to Van Mander, Van Eyck experimented with varnishes and binding agents,\n\u201cand found after much investigation that pigments mixed with such oils became\nmalleable and dried hard, and having dried became impermeable, and that the oil\nmade colours livelier, and that they themselves became lustrous without varnishing.\u201d4\nIt turns out that Van Eyck did not invent oil paint, and neither was he an alchemist.\nNevertheless he would never have been described in those terms had not artists\nand alchemists both been considered agents of material transformation. Van\nMander\u2019s description of Van Eyck\u2019s experimentation also reminds us that painters\nand alchemists shared materials, and that painters used artificially created pigments,\n\u201cmade by alchemy\u201d according to Cennino Cennini (c.1370\u2013c.1440). However, this\n3\n4\nDavis, \u201cRenaissance Inventions.\u201d\nMander, Het schilder-boeck, 199v.

In the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the term laboratorium uniquely referred to workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed: smelting, combustion,\ndistillation, dissolution, and precipitation. Matteo Martelli has convincingly\nshown that no such term was available in Antiquity.5 The Papyri, containing recipes\nfor the production of a range of luxury goods, and the earliest texts on alchemy,\nused the terminology of specific crafts (dyeing, metalworking and glassmaking).\nWhile artisans labored in workshops with tools and ingredients specific to their\ncraft, alchemists seemed to have made use of a more complex set of materials,\ninstruments and techniques belonging to various crafts. However, Martelli also\nshows that even the earliest alchemists developed specialized equipment. This leads\nto the assumption that as early as the first century AD, alchemists in Hellenistic\nEgypt began to differentiate themselves from artisans. However, there was no\nworkplace specifically designed for alchemists to engage in their activities. It is\nlikely they accessed the material equipment in artisanal workshops.\nBy the early modern period, the alchemist had acquired a specific place of work.\nAccording to Pamela Smith, by the mid-sixteenth century, these laboratories were\nreferred to formally as laboratorium and officina.6 The ubiquity of furnaces and the\nuse of fire demanded a specific workplace, whereas experimental philosophy still\nlacked specific places of experimentation in the seventeenth century. Laboratories\nwere associated with secretive practices. When in the early seventeenth century\nAndreas Libavius described the ideal workplace of the chemist, he emphasized how\nit differed from the dark, smelly, secretive laboratory that was noticeably lacking in\ndecorum:\nWe do not want the chemist to neglect the exercises of piety or exempt himself from other\nduties of an upright life, simply pining away amidst his dark furnaces [. . .]. Thus we are not\ngoing to devise from him just a chymeion or laboratory to use as a private study and\nhideaway in order that his practice will be more distinguished than anyone else\u2019s; but\nrather, what we shall provide for him is a dwelling suitable for decorous participation in\nsociety and living the life of a free man [. . .].7\n5\nMartelli, \u201cGreek Alchemists at Work.\u201d\nSmith, \u201cLaboratories,\u201d 299.\n7\nLibavius, \u201cCommentariorum alchymiae.\u201d Quoted and translated in Hannaway, \u201cLaboratory\nDesign,\u201d 599.

The material\nculture supporting this laboratory work remained largely unchanged. The exception\nis the material equipment for transmutational alchemy and the making of the\nPhilosophers\u2019 Stone, which generally disappeared from laboratories together with\ntransmutational alchemy itself in the eighteenth century. Laboratories were places\nin which the study of nature and technical innovation went hand in hand.\nAs already mentioned, the term \u201claboratory\u201d was not only used to refer to the\nworkplace of the alchemist. All workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nperformed were known as laboratories, and as such, artisanal workshops with\nfurnaces and fire in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed were also\nknown as laboratories. For example, the places in which sixteenth-century producers of fireworks developed their materials were called laboratories.9 In terms of\nmaterial culture the laboratorium, for example, one designed and equipped by\nCount Wolfgang II von Hohenlohe-Weidersheim (1546\u20131610) in the early seventeenth century, was remarkably similar to the workplaces of apothecaries, metalworkers and glassmakers.10\nBefore the emergence of mercantilist states, Renaissance courts were the most\nimportant agents in establishing laboratories. The laboratories of Rudolf II (1552\u2013\n1612) in Prague and Landgrave Moritz von Hessen-Kassel (1572\u20131632) were\nthought to bring material and intellectual rewards.11 Moritz even founded a chair\nof chymiatria at the University of Marburg in 1609.12 The teaching of Johannes\nHartmann (1561\u20131631), who was appointed to the chair, included work in the\nlaboratory, likewise established at the university. Courts also developed workplaces\nin which the work of artisans could be tested. Most famously, in the 1670s, Johann\nJoachim Becher (1635\u20131682) proposed the establishment of a Kunst- und\nWerckhaus at the court in Vienna.13 It would have included several different sorts\nof manufactures: porcelain making, silk and wool weaving, the production of\nmedicines and glassmaking. Chemical laboratories were to form the core of the\n8\nKlein, \u201cLaboratory Challenge,\u201d and \u201cApothecary Shops.\u201d For the dissociation of experimental\nphilosophy from the alchemical laboratory, see Shapin, \u201cHouse of Experiment.\u201d\n9\nWerrett, Fireworks, 29\u201330.\n10\nWeyer, Graf Wolfgang II. von Hohenlohe.

These laboratories were intended to specialize in salts and acids used in the\nproduction of mineral dyes. Becher envisioned that the manufacture and export of\nthese dyes would finance the other operations of the Kunst- und Werckhaus. He also\nenvisaged the house attracting artisans from various crafts and that it would\nfunction as a deposit of recipes and descriptions of techniques. Trained artisans\nwould then be sent out to distribute new processes, new manufactures and inventions. Becher used alchemy to intrigue his patron, who was always interested in the\nwealth promised by metallic transmutation, and to link the worlds of the court and\ncommerce.\nSuch court projects often took inspiration from the two earliest examples of\nspaces bringing together alchemy and the decorative arts at the Medici court in\nFlorence. Two essays in this volume deal with these Florentine workplaces: Fanny\nKieffer discusses the Uffizi, and Marco Beretta the Casino di San Marco. Founded\nin 1586 by Francesco I de\u2019 Medici (1541\u20131587), and developed by his successor,\nFerdinando I (1549\u20131609), the Uffizi housed the fonderia, a workspace for the arts\nof fire. Here medicines were prepared and metals fused. The fonderia was simultaneously a pharmacy, an alchemical laboratory, a smithy, a goldsmith\u2019s workshop,\nand a confectionary. The activities performed in the Uffizi included everything from\npreparing jams and sugar sculptures to the production of glass and fireworks (and\nless peaceful applications of saltpeter). Francesco I also established the Casino di\nSan Marco. It included an alchemical laboratory, a furnace for producing porcelain,\nand a glass workshop in which, under the direction of Niccolo Sisti, cristallo\n(so named because it was as clear as rock crystal) was made, as well as all sorts\nof colored glass in imitation of precious stones. Other important activities in the\nCasino were the fusion of rock crystal, the counterfeiting of precious stones, the\nproduction of fireworks, and the preparation of pharmaceutical remedies. Similar\nactivities were developed in the Uffizi and the Casino, and recipes and personnel\ntravelled between the two places. The only exception was Medici porcelain, which\nwas exclusively produced in the workshops of the Casino.\nIn sum, Renaissance courts established spaces where artisanal workshops and\nlaboratories were brought together facilitating the circulation of materials, people\nand knowledge between the worlds of craft (today\u2019s decorative arts) and alchemy.\nArt Technologies and Knowledge of Material Transformation\nLaboratories were not only the workplaces of transmutational alchemists. The Uffizi\nand the Casino had little in common with the workplaces of alleged goldmakers\ndestined to fail and bring their families to financial ruin, as famously depicted by\nPieter Brueghel the Elder (c.1525\u20131569) (Fig. 2). Just as the spaces known as\nlaboratories encompassed the workplaces of artisans laboring at furnaces and\n\nPages 13:\nxii\nIntroduction\nFig. 2 Pieter Brueghel the Elder, The Alchemist\u2019s Family: Al-gemist, 1558 (Courtesy of the\nKupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)\nusing materials and chemical procedures to make both everyday items and objects\nof the visual and decorative arts, the activity known as alchemy encompassed more\nthan attempts to make gold.14 Transmutational alchemy was about the transmutation of all base metals into more noble ones, but chrysopoeia was only one\naspect of alchemy. Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture.\nIt was about the chemical production of things\u2014medicines, porcelain, dyes, and\nother products as well as the precious metals\u2014and about the knowledge of how to\nproduce them. In this sense, \u201cart technologies\u201d\u2014materials and techniques to make\nart and knowledge of these materials and techniques\u2014overlapped with alchemy.\nAlchemy has deep roots in writings on material transformation from Antiquity.\nThe productive knowledge associated with material transformation was written\ndown in recipe books. The Leiden and Stockholm Papyri date to the third century\nAD. They contain recipes for the making of gold and silver, for the imitation of\nprecious stones, and for textile dyes. Whether a recipe is about coloring silver to\nmake it look like gold or the making of an imitation ruby or another artificial\nprecious stone, all of the recipes in the Papyri are, indeed, about material transformation and color change as related to the manufacture of luxury goods. As\nMatteo Martelli shows in this volume, relatively early on a historical process of\nselection, appropriation and differentiation resulted in a more limited definition of\n14\nFor the scope of early modern alchemy and the notion of \u2018chymistry\u2019, see Principe, Secrets of\nAlchemy; and Newman &amp; Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. Chemistry.\u201d\n\nPages 14:\nIntroduction\nxiii\nalchemy primarily focused on the making of gold and silver. Already around\n300 AD, a distinction was introduced between a limited definition of alchemy as\nmetallic transmutation and a more encompassing definition including productive\nknowledge and various artisanal technologies.\nTransmitted to Europe, and translated into Latin and the vernaculars, several of\nthe recipes in the Papyri are still found in collections of recipes in the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries. More importantly, as Martelli remarks in his essay, the scope of\na recipe collection such as the Mappae clavicula, compiled between the ninth and\nthe twelfth centuries, is as encompassing as that of the Papyri despite the earlier\nattempts to limit alchemy to metallic transmutation only. It should not come as a\nsurprise then that Sylvie Neven finds it difficult to demarcate between alchemical\nand art technological recipes in late medieval collections of recipes. Her contribution to this volume shows that alchemical and art technological recipes shared a\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art\ntechnology was crucial to the polemics of artists and alchemists and the rivalry\nbetween alchemy and the arts.16 Given the contested nature of the field of inquiry,\nit follows that the identity of the alchemist was equally contested and complex. In\nthe early modern period the alchemist was often portrayed as a fraud. The portrayals\nof laboratory scenes building on Brueghel became a genre of its own in the\nNetherlands.17 In these scenes, the alchemist is a goldmaker searching in vain for\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone and riches. As Tara Nummedal has convincingly shown,\nthe portrayal of the alchemist as a fraud also created the opportunity for other\nalchemists to fashion themselves in the role of experts, offering their services to\ncourts and other patrons to help them unmask fraudulent alchemists.18 Alchemical\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15\nFor reading and writing as alchemical practices, see Nummedal, \u201cWords and Works,\u201d and the\nliterature quoted there.\n16\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, 115\u201363.\n17\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations, 11\u201327.\n18\nFor experts and entrepreneurial alchemy, see Nummedal, Alchemy and Authority, 40\u20135.\n\nPages 15:\nxiv\nIntroduction\nIt is in this context of alchemical expertise that we should consider the artisans\nwho adopted the language of alchemy in the early modern period to attract the\nattention of patrons. One example can be seen in the description of Black Berthold,\nthe legendary discoverer of gunpowder in Europe, in the late fifteenth-century\nmanuscript Feuerwerckbuch. Depicted in the company of a furnace and alembics,\nBerthold\u2019s creation of ordnance is identified with alchemy. Black Berthold, the\nFeuerwerckbuch reads,\nworked with the great alchemy like those masters who are engaged with precious and\nvaluable things, with silver and gold, and with similar metals. These masters can separate\nsilver and gold from other precious jewelry, and from other valuable colors which they can\nproduce. Now this master Berthold wanted to induce a golden coloration. For this he used\nsalpetre, sulphur, lead and oil. Then he put these ingredients in a container made of copper,\nwhich he sealed completely, exactly as it should be done, but when he put it on fire and the\ncontainer became hot, it burst into many pieces.19\nThe Feuerwerckbuch witnesses material production based on practical chemistry in\nterms borrowed from alchemical transmutation, or more precisely, the making of\ngold. The analogy was not always with chrysopoeia as such. Vasari\u2019s already\nmentioned fashioning of Van Eyck as an alchemist shows that the image of alchemy\nas a field of expert inquiry on materials and material transformation was considered\nsufficiently positive to identify with. However, we should not forget that Vasari\u2019s\nidentification of Van Eyck as an alchemist served the purpose of downplaying\nNetherlandish art as techne, only a first step in a narrative of art historical progress\nculminating in Vasari\u2019s beloved Florentine art.\nThe epistemic value of techne was shifting at the time of Vasari. Artisans came\nto be considered experts of nature likening the artisanal processes of material\ntransformation undertaken in their workshops to those of nature.20 As Andrea\nBernardoni shows in this volume, Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia is part of this larger\nprocess of shifting epistemic value of artisanal processes. Rejecting transmutational\nalchemy as \u201cfalse\u201d and the alchemists who practiced it as fraudulent, Biringuccio\ncarved out space for true alchemy as one of the arts of fire. Artisanal workshops,\nsuch as Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (c.1435\u20131488) in which Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u2013\n1519) apprenticed or Leonardo\u2019s own workplace, shared a material culture with\nalchemical laboratories. As we have already pointed out, artisans used similar\nequipment and performed \u201cchemical\u201d operations. However, Bernardoni argues,\nBiringuccio made the claim that these artisans were the true experts on matter,\nmaterials and material transformation and that artisanal \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nthe key to natural knowledge.\nOne of the readers of Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia was Johannes Mathesius (1504\u2013\n1565), a Lutheran preacher in St. Joachimsthal, the center of an important mining\ndistrict. In her contribution to this volume, Henrike Haug analyzes Mathesius\u2019s\n19\nHassenstein, Das Feuerwerckbuch, 45\u20136. For translation and discussion, see Werrett,\nFireworks, 28.\n20\nSmith, Body of the Artisan. esp. 95\u2013127.\n\nPages 16:\nIntroduction\nxv\nsermons to reveal conceptions of the origin and formation of ores for which\nMathesius drew equally on natural philosophy and alchemy and on the artisanal\nknowledge of the local miners and goldsmiths. Following one of the goldsmiths\u2019\nmost prized objects, a so-called Handstein, into the Kunstkammer, Haug shows that\nthis knowledge also reached elite collectors. They valued Handsteine for the\nmetallogenetic knowledge they embodied, thereby endorsing the shifting epistemic\nstatus of the arts.\nEpistemic Changes Between Artisans and Alchemists\nBiringuccio and Mathesius\u2019s St. Joachimsthal are examples of persons and places\nof exchange between scholarly cultures (in which learning is based on reading and\nwriting) and artisanal cultures (in which learning is based on doing).21 The laboratories created in Medici Florence, discussed in the chapters by Kieffer and\nBeretta, were also early examples of such places of exchange, followed by many\nother European courts. These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and\nworkshops. In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures. By the seventeenth century, the expertise of some glassmakers,\nsilver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of\nalchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the\nlaboratory.24 Lawrence Principe and Morgan Wesley discuss two examples of\nsuch arts: silversmithing and porcelain production, respectively.\n21\nFor \u2018trading zones\u2019 between artisanal and scholarly cultures, see Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23\nOn hybrid experts, see Klein, \u201cArtisanal-Scientific Experts,\u201d and \u201cDepersonalizing the Arcanum.\u201d\n24\nFor glassmaking (not discussed here), see Beretta, Alchemy of Glass; and Dupre\u0301, \u201cValue of\nGlass.\u201d\n22\n\nPages 17:\nxvi\nIntroduction\nSilver- and goldsmiths seem obvious candidates when we think of careers that\ncross artisan and alchemist. Silversmiths, goldsmiths and alchemists worked on the\nsame materials (silver and gold), and silver- and goldsmiths\u2019 expertise was called\nfor to assay the purported gold and silver transmuted by alchemists. Silver- and\ngoldsmiths could also become involved themselves in transmutational endeavours.\nIn his contribution to this book, Principe focuses on the brothers Anthoni and\nAndries Grill (1604\u20131655) as examples of such hybrid figures. They ran successful\nsilversmithing businesses in mid-seventeenth century Amsterdam and The Hague.\nAnthoni Grill\u2019s Amsterdam laboratory also produced work on transmutation for\nwhich he gained some notoriety. Moreover, Grill\u2019s work on chymistry was not only\nbased on learning by doing; he is reported to have read Paracelsus and Glauber.\nGrill moved between artisanal and scholarly worlds and between learning by doing\nand by reading. Both came together in his laboratory in Amsterdam.\nIn the final chapter of this book, Wesley investigates the production of porcelain\nin the seventeenth century. The potter\u2019s art remained outside the canon of the\ndecorative arts until the emergence of the trade of luxury pottery ware in the\nfifteenth century and Biringuccio\u2019s inclusion of pottery among the arts of fire in\nthe sixteenth century. Although (as already mentioned) the Medici sought to imitate\nthe porcelain imported from China in the Casino, European hard-paste porcelain,\nalmost identical to that of China, was due to the efforts of seventeenth-century\nchymists who were both at home in the artisanal world of pottery and in the learned\nworld, according to Wesley. His chapter highlights John Dwight (1633\u20131704),\ntrained in Robert Boyle\u2019s (1627\u20131691) laboratory and apt with excellent language\nskills, and Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708), mathematician and\ndirector of the Dresden court laboratory of the Saxon Elector Friedrich August I\n(1670\u20131733).25 Tschirnhaus collaborated with the alchemist and apothecary Johann\nFriedrich Bo\u0308ttger (1682\u20131719), also involved in transmutational endeavors at the\nDresden court, towards the production of porcelain. In the first porcelain manufactory in Meissen, established by the Elector in his castle Albrechtsburg in 1710,\nBo\u0308ttger was the expert overseeing the manufacturing process, knowledgeable in\nchemistry and skilled in porcelain production. Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds. The rise of\nthese hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of laboratories in\nwhich art technologies and alchemy were brought together, the first of these being\nat Renaissance courts. Laboratories and artisanal workshops shared a material\n25\nSee also Pietsch, \u201cTschirnhaus,\u201d and Klein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n\nPages 18:\nIntroduction\nxvii\nculture. In fact, in the early modern period, they were often so similar in terms of the\ninstruments they contained that they carried the same name. This material culture\nremained largely the same. A change took place at another level: the increasing\npresence of books and texts in laboratories and workshops populated by figures who\nmerged artisanal and scholarly cultures. This book suggests that this shift in\nworkshop culture facilitated the epistemic exchanges between alchemists and producers of the decorative arts.\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was conceived and written in dialogue with an exhibition project \u201cArt\nand Alchemy. The Mystery of Transformation.\u201d The exhibition is on view at the\nMuseum Kunstpalast in Du\u0308sseldorf from April to August 2014. I would like to\nthank my co-curators of the show, Dedo von Kerssenbrock-Krosigk (director of the\nGlasmuseum Hentrich in Du\u0308sseldorf and the initiator of the exhibition project) and\nLawrence Principe, for their inspiration, sound advice, and help with almost every\nsingle step in the process of making this book. Without them, the book would have\nbeen very different, and more importantly, far below the quality of the present\nresult. The exhibition project in Du\u0308sseldorf was a constant inspiration, many thanks\nto the exhibition team and the curator of the modern part of the show, general\ndirector of the Museum Kunstpalast Beat Wismer, who all contributed to making\nthe project such an intellectually rewarding experience.\nWe worked towards this book during several smaller meetings and one larger\nconference hosted at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in March\n2013. Although this book contains only a selection of the papers presented at this\nconference, I would like to thank all presenters as well as all commentators and\ndiscussants for their contributions before during and after the conference. Their\ninterventions have made this a much better book.

Which kinds of techniques and craft\npractices does it encompass? And what were its goals? The paper addresses these\nquestions by investigating the earliest Greek alchemical texts preserved both in\nByzantine and in Syriac manuscripts. Already during the first centuries AD, in the\nGraeco-Roman Egypt it is possible to recognize some disagreement over the\ndefinition of alchemy and its expected outcomes. On the one hand, ps.Democritus\u2019s four books and the Leiden and Stockholm papyri support a fourfold\ndivision of alchemy including processes for making gold, silver, and precious\nstones (glass working included), and for dyeing wool purple. On the other hand,\nIsis\u2019s treatise focuses only on the making of precious metals, which is identified\nwith the main goal of alchemy during the late Byzantine tradition. In the process\nthat led to such a simplification of the technical background of alchemy Zosimus\u2019s\nwork seems to represent an important turning point. In fact the author inherited the\nabove mentioned polarity and discussed different ideas of alchemy in a key text\n(here edited and translated into English for the first time) on the revelation of\nalchemy based on the Enochian myth of the fallen angels.\nAlchemy and the Making of Gold: An Overview\nof the Byzantine Tradition\nBetween the seventh and the eleventh century different people\u2014including imperators, caliphs, and scholars moved by antiquarian curiosities\u2014became interested in\nche\u0304meia (alchemy) and somehow identified this art with chrysopoeia (the making\nof gold) and argyropoeia (the making of silver). Sure enough, these people were not\npractitioners and they did not test the techniques described by alchemical recipes.\nM.

Martelli\nHowever, if we consider that the Byzantine anthologies preserving most of the\nGreek and Byzantine alchemical writings were probably compiled from the seventh\ncentury onwards, we should wonder to what extent a similar attitude could have\naffected the selection of the works transmitted by these collections.1 Did such a\nfocus on the making of precious metals influence the choice of the treatises to be\nincluded into Byzantine anthologies and translated into Syriac and Arabic?\nAlthough a complete answer to this question would surpass the aim of this chapter\nand would require a wider analysis of the hundreds of alchemical manuscripts\nnowadays kept in several European and Middle-Eastern libraries, in the following I\nfocus my attention especially on the polarity between the idea of alchemy as\nchrysopoeia attested by Byzantine scholars and a broader interest in different\ndyeing techniques attested by the most ancient alchemical writings (first to fourth\ncentury AD). Some of these works, in fact, covered a wider set of techniques\nfocusing not only on how to dye metals yellow and white (that is, how to transform\nthem into gold and silver), but also on how to dye crystal quartz different colours in\norder to produce precious stones, and how to dye wool purple.\nIn mid-eleventh century Constantinople, the Byzantine scholar Michael Psellos\n(1018\u2013c.1078) composed a small treatise on the making of gold in the form of a\nletter addressed to the Patriarch Michael I Cerularius (1043\u20131059), who asked the\nphilosopher to make an investigation on the ancient alchemical methods of\n\u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1 (chrysopoeia). After some theoretical remarks, Psellos introduced\nand somehow justified the specific focus of his small treatise as follows (Letter\non the Making of Gold, \u00a7 5 partim):\nSince in my preface I have already insisted enough on the fact that transformations of\nmatter happen according to natural changes, and not by means of magic spells, miracles, or\nsome other secret practice (so, we must not wonder), it is time to pass on to this art of\ntransformation. I would have liked to compose a complete discourse on this art and on how\nto work the matters [. . .] and to teach what makes quartz and sapphire porous, what\nproduces a fake emerald and beryl, which nature can soften stones, which one can dilute\npearls and make them watery, and which one can make then again solid and round, and how\nto whiten them [. . .] However, since you [Michael Cerularius] do not allow me to delay\nwith such superfluous inquiries, wasting all my studiousness in a worthless research, but\nyou want me to examine with which substances and according to which scientific method\ngold may be produced, I am going to explain only this topic.2\n1\nSee Mertens, \u201cGreco-Egyptian Alchemy,\u201d 220\u20135.\nEdition by Bidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 30, 16\u201331, 9: \u201c\u1f18\u03c0\u03b5\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u1f31\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\n\u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f31 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f10\u03be \u1f10\u03c0\u1ff3\u03b4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\n\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u1ff6 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2\n\u1f22 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\u03b4\u03b9\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c7\u03c1\u03ae), \u1f10\u03c0\u2019 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f22\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb~\n\u03b7\u03c2. \u1f18\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bbo\u0301\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f51\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, [. . .] \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03be\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03af \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd, \u03c4\u03af \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd\n\u1f51\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1ff6\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u1fc3 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f21 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2\n\u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1&lt;

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document *Laboratories of Art: Alchemy and Art Technology from Antiquity to the 18th Century* has been summarized up to page 27, and it delves into several key topics around the intersections of alchemy, materials science, and art technologies. Key themes include the blending of artisanal knowledge with alchemical practices, early laboratory spaces, and the transmission of alchemical and artistic knowledge.

The first chapters provide insights into:
- The fourfold division of alchemy and how it encompasses goldmaking, silver, precious stones, and dyeing practices.
- Transmission of alchemical and artistic knowledge through medieval recipe books and manuscripts, demonstrating how artisanal and alchemical practices were closely intertwined.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool.

Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for. He longed for it, but I did not give\nmyself and I was able to curb his desire until he showed me his mark on the head and\nrevealed all the mysteries I was looking for, without envy and faithfully.23\nThe \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 (Egyptian holy art) quoted at the beginning of the\npassage is clearly identified by Isis with \u1f21 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae\nI have followed the more recent edition by Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 128\u201331: \u201c\u1f3c\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6~\n\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff7\n\u03c5\u1f31\u1ff7 \u1f6d\u03c1\u1ff3. \u1f08\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f66 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a4\u03c5\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76\n\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1o\u0301\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 &lt;\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2&gt; \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, &lt;. . .&gt; \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b9$ \u03b3\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5,\n\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03b8\u03b1 \u1f31\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1f78\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1o\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\n\u0002\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137. The three recipes that have been edited correspond\nwith the texts translated or summarized by Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 223 (rec. 2), 224\u20135 (rec. 8\u2013\n9), 225 (rec. 12); and Giumlia-Mair, \u201cZosimos the Alchemist,\u201d 319\u201321.\n43\nSee, for example, Giumlia-Mair, \u201cKrokodil.\u201d\n\nPages 40:\n16\nM. Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions. Presented in the form of a succession of more or less short notes, these\nS.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 28 to page 48 out of a total of 220.

Martelli\nEmpire, the same definition had been already given by the Persian scholar al-Nad\u0131\u0304m\n(ninth century AD), who devoted the tenth chapter of his Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist (Book of\nCatalogue) to the sina\u0304\u2018at al-k\u0131\u0304m\u0131\u0304ya\u0304\u2019 (art of alchemy): at the very beginning of the\nchapter this art is\u02d9 defined again as \u201cthe making of gold and silver from other\nmetals.\u201d8 More than one century later, the Syriac scholar Bar Bahlul (eleventh\ncentury AD) dealt with the same subject in two entries of his lexicon:\n1. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 901:\nKimiya, the dark stone. It is the work of the art of gold and silver. And there is\nsomeone who explains this word from the name kima (the constellation of the\nPleiades), that is the height stars, because (this art) is accomplished by means of\nthe height mixtures.9\n2. Duval, Lexicon Syriacum, vol. I, 904:\nKemela\u2019a, that is the alchemy (kimiya\u2019a) of the seven bodies and of the\nvarious natures; [it includes] arts such as goldsmith\u2019s art and copper, iron, and\nglass working.10\nOnly the last definition includes a wide set of techniques applied to different\nsubstances (among which glass is mentioned), while most of the above-quoted\ntexts identifies alchemy with the making of gold and silver. The two precious metals\nwere probably the most attractive outcomes that anyone engaged in alchemical\npractices tried to achieve out of this art, as is possible to infer from a few accounts\non alchemists preserved by Byzantine and Syriac chronographers. In the mid-sixth\ncentury, for instance, John Malalas (491\u2013578) reported the story of John Istmeos,\n\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03bf\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (alchemist and tremendous impostor),\nwho moved from Antioch to Constantinople, where he was condemned by the\nemperor Anastasios (491\u2013518) because of the adulterated gold objects he tried to\n8\nI have quoted the translation proposed by Dodge (The Fihrist, 841), who checked several\nmanuscripts (see pp. xxiii\u2013xxxiv) not taken into account by Flu\u0308gel, who edited the Arabic text.\nIn Flu\u0308gel\u2019s edition (Kita\u0304b al-Fihrist, vol.

The Syrian city of Antioch was again the\nscene of an \u2018alchemical affaire\u2019 at the beginning of the eighth century, when Isaac,\nbishop of Harra\u0304n, is said to have become archbishop of the city (755\u2013756) thanks to\n\u02d9\nhis alchemical knowledge. According to various Syriac chronicles, Isaac murdered\na monk of Edessa and stole from him a powder that, when applied on lead, could\ntransform it into gold.11 By means of this powder, Isaac was able to find favour with\nthe Caliph al-Ma\u0304nsur (754\u2013775), who turned out to be very interested in this\n\u02d9\nsubstance and supported (at least for a little while) Isaac\u2019s political career. Moreover, Arabic sources claim that the same caliph sent his emissary \u2018Uma\u0304ra ibn\nHamza to the court of Constantine V (741\u2013775), who led the guest into a big\n\u02d9\nstorehouse containing two kinds of powder: a white elixir that could transmute\nmetals into silver, and a yellow/red one that could transform metals into gold.12\nTwo Early Alchemical Treatises: Ps.-Democritus and Isis\nAfter the above-discussed passage, Psellos carries on his investigation by listing\nand commenting seven recipes describing how to prepare specific \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1 (medicines) with which to treat base metals (lead first of all) and transform them into\ngold. The section is concluded by the rhetorical question: \u201cHow so? Should I\nshortly reveal you all the wisdom of Democritus without leaving anything in the\ninnermost sanctuary?\u201d13\nThe reference to the \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 (the wisdom of Democritus), the philosopher from Abdera par excellence, is noteworthy, since Democritus (fl. 440\u2013380\nBC) is usually considered one of the most ancient authors of alchemical treatises\nhanded down by Byzantine manuscripts. These treatises are obviously spurious and\nwere composed by an anonymous author in the second half of the first century\nAD. However, in contrast with Psellos\u2019s account focusing only on chrysopoeia, the\nalchemical tradition ascribes to the philosopher four books dealing with a wider set\nof interests that included not only the making of silver and gold, but also the making\nof precious stones and the purple dyeing of wool. For instance, the alchemist\nSynesius (fourth century AD), who wrote a commentary on ps.-Democritus\u2019s\n11\nSee (a) the fourth part of the Zuqn\u0131\u0304q Chronicle or Chronicle of ps.-Dyonisus of Tell-Mahre,\nedited by Chabot, Pseudo-Dyonysianum, 66; (b) the chronicle of Michael the Syrian, edited by\nChabot, Michel le Syrien, 474; (c) the anonymous chronicle edited by Brooks, \u201cSyriac Fragment,\u201d\n217\u20138.\n12\nFor instance, the story is told by the geographer Ibn al-Faq\u0131\u0304h al-Hamadani (Goeje, Ibn al-Faq\u0003{n\nal-Hamada\u0304n\u0003{, 137\u20139; French transl. by Masse\u0301, Abre\u0301ge\u0301 du Livre de Pays,\u02d9 164\u20136); see Strohmaier,\n\u00af Hamza,\u201d 21\u20132.\n\u201cUma\u0304ra ibn\n\u02d9\n13\nBidez, E\u00b4pitre sur la Chrysope\u0301e, 40,7\u20138: \u201c\u03a4\u03af \u03bf\u1f56\u03bd; \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f08\u03b2\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1\u03bd\n\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f00\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\u201d\n\nPages 30:\n6\nM. Martelli\nalchemical writings, introduced the alleged production of the philosopher as follows (Syn. Alch. \u00a7 1, ll. 5\u201314 Martelli):\nSo now let me start telling you something about this man, the philosopher Democritus, who\nwas a natural philosopher from Adbera, who investigated every natural question and\nexplained every phenomenon on the basis of its own nature. Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by\nSynesius as \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 (books on dyeing), since ps.-Democritus dealt with a\nwide range of dyeing techniques based on various methods for changing the colours\nof metals, producing precious stones and using purple substitutes. The same areas\nof expertise are covered by the Graeco-Egyptian papyri of Leiden and Stockholm,\nwhich hand down several recipes describing (a) how to dye metals yellow or white\n(that is, how to transform them into gold or silver), (b) how to dye \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\n(quartz) and counterfeit different kinds of precious stones out of it, and (c) how to\ndye wool purple by means of various substitutes of the expensive Tyrian purple.15\nMoreover, ps.-Democritus combined the technical explanation of these methods\nwith a theoretical approach that emphasized the central role played by dyeing drugs\nand their properties.16 He analysed and classified \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (the natural ingredients) according to their capacities of dyeing and of mixing each other properly.17\nFor instance, in the middle of the book on the making of gold, after a long criticism\nagainst young people who did not accurately investigate the properties of natural\nsubstances, ps.-Democritus claims (PM \u00a7 16, ll. 178\u201380 Martelli):\nIf these young men had practised for these kinds of investigations, they would not be in\ntrouble, since they could set to work with judgement.

In fact, only an epitomized version has been\nincluded in the Byzantine collections, which contain just two sections ascribed to\nthe philosopher:\n1. The book on the making of gold (or more probably a summarized version of it) is\nintroduced by a very short section on purple dyeing and handed down under the\ntitle of \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Natural and Secret Questions).19\n2.

In fact, a later recipe book\npreserved by a few Byzantine manuscripts under the title of Deep Tincture of Stones,\nEmeralds, Rubies and Jacinth from the Book Taken out from the Innermost Sanctuary\nof Temples includes some passages discussing the dyeing methods applied by ancient\nalchemists on stones.21 Along with Democritus, his pretended master Ostanes,\nMoses, and Maria the Jewish are also quoted.22 Regrettably, the writings of these\nancient authors are lost, so that we cannot understand to what extent they actually\ndealt with similar topics. However, as far as ps.-Democritus is concerned, in all\nlikelihood he attributed a certain relevance to the dyeing of stones, if it is true that\nhe devoted an entire book to this subject. On the contrary, the exclusion of this\nbook\u2014along with most of the book on purple\u2014from the epitomized version handed\ndown by the Byzantine anthologies evidences the criteria adopted by the epitomiser\nof ps.-Democritus\u2019s writings: he seems to have focused his attention only on the\ntransmutation of metals into gold and silver, so revealing an attitude that tallies with\nthe approach we have already detected in the above-discussed Byzantine sources.\nNevertheless, although the relevance of chrysopoeia in Byzantine times can\nsomehow explain the loss of part of ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, one of the manuscripts\n18\nThe Greek text reads (\u00bc CAAG II 47\u20138): \u201c\u0395\u03b9$ \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0~\n\u03b7\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03bd\u03b5\u0002\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f02\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd, \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2\u0387 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8~\n\u03b7, \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f13\u03bd\n\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0002\u03ba\u03b1 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0002\u043f\u03b5\u03b9. \u1fec\u03b1\u03bd\u1f76\u03c2 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5 \u043f\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac.\u201d\n19\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 180\u2013205 (and 73\u20139) \u00bc CAAG II 41\u20139.\n20\nSee Martelli, Pseudo-Democrito, 206\u201316 (and 79\u201383) \u00bc CAAG II 49\u201353.\n21\nEdited in CAAG II 350\u201364; the Greek title reads: \u201c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f51\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03b4\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u0002\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\u201d The earliest testimonies are the\nmanuscripts Parisinus gr. 2325 (13th century; fols. 160v\u2013173v), and Parisinus gr. 2327 (15th\ncentury; fol. 147r\u2013159r).\n22\nSee, in particular, for Democritus: CAAG II 353,11\u201325, and 354,12\u2013357,19; for Ostanes:\nCAAG II 351,16\u201328, and 352,10 (fragments reedited by Bidez &amp; Cumont, Mages helle\u0301nise\u0301s,\nvol.

Martelli\nthat hands down the above-mentioned recipe book on precious stones preserves\nanother important treatise that introduces a new important element into the discussion. The Parisinus gr. 2325 (fols. 256r\u2013258v), in fact, contains a book ascribed to\nthe goddess Isis, which probably dates back to the second century AD and contains an\nimportant account of the revelation of the alchemical art. According to the beginning\nof the treatise, Isis received a revelation from two angels who descended from heaven\nbecause they were attracted by the beauty of the goddess (CAAG II 28\u20139):\nIsis the Prophet to Her Son Horus. O son, as you were about to leave and fight a battle\nagainst the unfaithful Typhon for the kingdom of your father, I went to Hormanouthis [city,\nsanctuary?] of the holy art in Egypt, where I stayed a long time. According to the recession\nof the convenient time and to the necessary course of the spherical movement, it happened\nthat one of the angels living in the first firmament, after watching me from above, wanted to\nhave sexual intercourse with me. When he arrived and started taking this direction, I did not\ngive myself, because I wanted to learn the preparation of gold and silver. After I asked him\nthis question, he told me that he was not allowed to reveal this point, because these secrets\nsurpassed him, but (he told me) that the next day his superior, the angel Amnae\u0304l, would\ncome, and that he would be able to give a reply for a similar inquiry [. . .] The next day, his\nsuperior Amnae\u0304l appeared when the sun was in the middle of its course, and he came down.\nTaken by the same desire for me, he did not await, but he hastened to get what he came for;\nbut I was not less focused on what I was searching for.

Probably it refers to an\nEgyptian city, although it does not match any of the five towns, where alchemy was practiced\naccording to CAAG II 26. Various corrections of the form \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af have been proposed: see, in\nparticular, Reitzenstein, Poimandres, 141, no. 3 (who proposed \u1f49\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, lit. \u2018Horus of Edfu\u2019),\nand Mertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 56\u201360 (who proposed M\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af, that is an area in the Egyptian city of\nCanopus).\n23\n\nPages 33:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n9\n(the preparation of gold and silver), that is, the same definition of alchemy attested\nby the Lexicon Suda (\u03c7 280) and supported by the Byzantine sources that have been\nbriefly analyzed in the first paragraph. The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver\nobjects), and the \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (dyeing processes) were moved by the same aim, that\nwas, according to the beginning of the treatise, the making of gold and silver.25\nTowards a Definition of Alchemy: Zosimus\nand the Enochian Myth\nThe plot of Isis\u2019s story, although set in a new Egyptian framework, clearly depends\non the Enochian account of the fallen angels who taught mankind about a divine\nand forbidden knowledge that included a wide set of crafts. The myth is fully\ndeveloped in the very first part of the so-called Book of Enoch (or 1Enoch), one of\nthe pseudepigrapha of the Ancient Testament ascribed to Enoch, the grandfather of\nNoah. The book is composed of different segments (or treatises), and in its most\ndeveloped form it is preserved only by a translation in Classical Ethiopic (fifth-sixth\ncentury AD). However, the major part of it is much earlier, as one can infer from\nvarious sections that have been preserved by the Aramaic manuscripts discovered\nin Qumran\u2019s caves.26 In particular the first part, usually called The Book of\nWatchers (\u00bc 1Enoch, chap. 1\u201336), is handed down in several Dead Sea scrolls\nand in all likelihood dates back to the third century BC.27 Moreover, this book has\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 134\u20138 \u00bc CAAG II 31\u20133.\nMertens, Lettre d\u2019Isis, 138, ll. 113\u20136 \u00bc CAAG II 33, \u00a7 16.\n26\nThe secondary literature on 1Enoch is vast; for a general introduction on its content, see, for\nexample, Knibb, Book of Enoch, 7\u201335.

Martelli\nbeen translated into Greek quite early, probably already in the second century BC,\nwithin the same cultural context that produced the Septuagint translation of\nDaniel.28\nAt the beginning of The Book of Watchers (1Enoch, chap. 6\u20138) the author\nexplains that two hundred angels\u2014called \u1f10\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (watchers) or \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c5\u1f31\u03bf\u1f76\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6 (the angels, sons of the Heaven) in the Greek version\u2014started desiring the\ndaughters of men and descended from heaven in order to have intercourse with\nthem. The Greek version of the passage, extensively quoted by the chronographer\nSyncellus, goes on as follows (Sync. p. 12, ll 8\u201317 Mosshammer):\nThe leaders [of these angels] and all the rest [of the two hundred watchers] took for\nthemselves wives in AM 1170, and they began to defile themselves with them up to the\nFlood. [. . .] And they were increasing in accordance with their greatness, and they taught\nthemselves and their wives the uses of potions and spell. First Azae\u0304l, the tenth of the\nleaders, taught them to make swords and armours and every instrument of war and how to\nwork the metals of the earth and gold, how to make them into adornments for their wives,\nand silver. He showed them also the use of cosmetics and beautifying the face and choice\nstones and colouring tinctures.29\nThe list of crafts revealed by Azae\u0304l, which includes the working of metals (with\nexplicit mention of gold and silver) and of precious stones along with \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n(dyeing procedures) in a more general sense, shows clear similarities with the topics\ncovered by ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books, which nevertheless do not refer back to\nthis myth (at least in the preserved sections). On the contrary, the myth was\nreworked in Isis\u2019s treatise, where the secret teaching of the angels was limited\nonly to the preparation of gold and silver. These different approaches to what was\nconsidered part of the alchemical art were inherited and discussed by Zosimus, a\nthird century author who clearly reused the Enochian myth in his own account of\nthe origins and developments of alchemy. In fact, Zosimus first introduced the term\nche\u0304meia with reference to fallen angels\u2019 revelation, which was written down in\nspecific and secret books. Regrettably, Zosimus\u2019s treatise is lost in its Greek\noriginal form, and just its beginning is quoted by Syncellus straight after the\nabove-mentioned passage taken from 1Enoch. However, a more complete version\nis preserved by an unedited Syriac translation handed down in the Cambridge\nmanuscript Mm. 6.29. The two versions read as follows:\n1.

Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu]. They called this book Che\u0304meu,32 whence also the art is\ncalled Alchemy (i.e. che\u0304meia),\u201d and so forth.33\n2. Syriac Zosimus (for a preliminary edition of this text see Appendix)\nEighth Treatise on the Working of Tin; Letter He\u0304th. The Book tells us about tin\n\u02d9 Theosebeia. The holy scripand Zosimus gives his best greetings to the queen\ntures say, my lady, that there is a race of demons who has intercourse with the\nwomen and has authority over them. Hermes also mentions this story in his\nPhysika as well as, so to say, every clear or secret treatise recalls it. In this way,\n30\nThe title Imouth is not elsewhere attested in Zosimus\u2019s treatises handed down by the Byzantine\ntradition. Moreover, the reference to the ninth book is not confirmed by the Syriac tradition, where\nthis passage is included in the eighth book by Zosimus. The Arabic Tome of Images (Mushaf\nas-suwar), preserved under the name of the Egyptian alchemist (although its authenticity\u02d9 \u02d9 is\n\u02d9\u02d9\nquestioned;\nsee Hallum, \u201cTome of Images\u201d) preserves a similar account in the sixth book, entitled\nBook About the Nature or Book of Imouth (see Abt &amp; Fuad, Book of Pictures, 393, 22).\n31\nThe woman to whom Zosimus usually addresses his treatises; perhaps a pupil of the alchemist:\nsee Hallum, \u201cTheosebeia.\u201d\n32\nThe term Che\u0304meu (hapax) is likely to be the title of the book in which the teaching of angels was\nrevealed.

Martelli\nin fact, the ancient and holy books tell that some angels fell in love passionately\nwith the women, came down &lt;and&gt; taught them about all the works of nature.\nFor this reason, as the book says, those who acted haughtily remained outside\nheaven, since they taught mankind all the malicious things which do not benefit\nthe soul at all. The books claim that the works (of nature?) started up from them\nand theirs is the first exposition concerning these crafts. They called these books\nKwmw, whence also alchemy (kumiya) takes its name. There are 24 treatises in\nthis book. Each of them is given a specific title that is either a letter (of the\nalphabet) or a word. They are explained by the words of priests. One of these is\nentitled \u2018Imus\u2019, another \u2018Imuth\u2019, another \u2018Face\u2019\u2014so it was interpreted\n(or translated). One of these is entitled \u2018Key\u2019, another \u2018Seal\u2019 or \u2018Signet\u2019, another\n\u2018Handbook\u2019 (see gr. \u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), another \u2018Position\u2019 (of the stars? see gr. \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae).\nAs I said, each one is given a specific title. This book contains the crafts and\nmany thousands of words. Then those who came afterwards, with the intent of\ndoing well, divided the book in many parts; as someone would say: (they did so)\nin order to compose short versions (of the book) for themselves. And they were\nnot even able to write something useful. For they did not only damage the books\nof alchemy, but also hidden them. The philosopher (i.e. Democritus) claims:\n\u2018they hid the writings on the natural substances under the multiplicity of matter.\u2019\nPerhaps they wanted to exercise our souls. Now, if they exercise the souls, well,\nphilosopher, why to deny it? But you know how to exercise either the body or the\nsoul, and it always leads you to achieve the perfection. In fact a wise saying\nreads: \u2018studying is everything.\u2019 And also Isidoros says: \u2018studying increases your\nwork.\u2019 I know, this is not beyond your understanding (my lady), but you know it\nwell, since you are one of those who would have liked to hide the art, if it had not\nbeen put in writing. For this reason you formed an assembly and administered\nthe oath to each other. But you (my lady) moved away from the various topics\n(of this book); you presented them in a shorter form and you taught them openly.\nBut you claim that this book cannot be possessed unless in secret. Now, even\nthough secrets are necessary, it is quite fair that anyone has a book of alchemy,\nsince it is not kept secret for them. You must know, my lady, he (i.e. Democritus?)34 claimed that those who wrote short versions (of the book) said that just\nsilver can be dyed gold. But the book of alchemy they have hidden assured that\nlead and tin and iron and silver take the color of gold, each metal (takes the color\nof) the other one, and again the same metals (take the color of) silver, the same\nmetals (the color of) copper, the same metals (the color of) iron. Lead produces\ntin, copper (produces) iron, silver (produces) gold. In the same way tin\n34\nBerthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 239, considered the philosopher (i.e. ps.-Democritus) as the author\nof the following quotation. Although the ancient alchemist is cited few lines before (49v18), this\nidentification is not certain.\n\nPages 37:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n13\n(produces) the same metals as well. And again from the beginning to the end and\nfrom the end to the beginning.\nThe Syriac text may be divided into two parts. The first section (49r12\u201349v6)\nmatches the Greek passage cited by Syncellus and rephrases the story told by The\nBook of Enoch: in all likelihood Zosimus refers to this book when he mentions the\nholy scriptures (Sync. 14,3 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u00bcSyrZos. 49r14\n). The\nsecond section gives a detailed description of the book entitled Che\u0304meu and\nexplains how it was transmitted and somehow corrupted.\nIn the first part Zosimus attributes the revelation of che\u0304meia both to angels\n(Sync. 14,6 \u1f04\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03af \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r18\n) and to demons (Sync. 14,3\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bco\u0301\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\n\u0002\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\u00bcSyrZos. 49r15\n), so introducing a slight variation\ninto the Enochian myth, where fallen angels usually play the most important role.\nAlthough the name of demons is mentioned only at the very beginning of the\npassage, their presence allows us to read Zosimus\u2019s account in the light of the\ncomplex (and still unclear in many respects) demonology developed by the author\nin two other treatises, namely On the Letter Omega (CAAG II 228\u2013234) and the\nFirst Book of the Final Account (CAAG II 239\u2013245).35 According to the second\nwork, the two main sources of wealth for Egypt were gold mines and the dyeing\ntechniques, in particular the so-called \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af (opportune tinctures), that is,\nthe dyeing processes whose success depended on the influence of demons and on\nthe astrological time in which they were performed.36 This knowledge was considered secret and no ancient authors could reveal it; only Democritus\u2014Zosimus\nclaims\u2014hinted at these tinctures in his explanation of the four \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(valuable arts), which must be identified with the topics covered by the four\nbooks, namely the making of gold, of silver, of precious stones, and the purple\ndyeing of wool.37 These opportune tinctures were originally called \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\n(natural tinctures) and had been explained by Hermes in his \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd\n(Book of Natural Dyes). However, demons became jealous of this knowledge and\nwanted to make it secret and dependent on their own control (i.e. on the influences\nof the stars they governed). They started revealing these tinctures, or even a\ncounterfeited form of them (called at some point \u201cunnatural tinctures\u201d), only to\ntheir priests in order to be worshipped and receive the appropriate sacrifices.38\n35\nSee Fraser, \u201cZosimos of Panopolis.\u201d For a new and reliable edition of the first treatise,\nsee Mertens, Zosime de Panopolis, 1\u201310.

Martelli\nNot surprisingly, if we come back to the above-edited passages, Zosimus\ninterpreted Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in The Book of Enoch as referring to the knowledge\nof tinctures he considered at the basis of any alchemical activity. \u03a4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac are in\nfact explicitly mentioned by the apocryphal book (see supra) along with a specific\nset of crafts, which is in many respects comparable with the arts explained in ps.Democritus\u2019s four books on dyeing (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 according to Synesius). Moreover, next to The Book of Enoch Zosimus mentions also a book of Hermes entitled\nPhysika as one of the sources from which he took the account on the angelic/\ndemonic revelation. The identification of this treatise is far from certain, even\nthough the title and the context in which Physika is cited remind us of Hermes\u2019s\nBook of Natural Dyes quoted in the First Book of the Final Account: there Zosimus\nclaimed that Hermes\u2019s treatise was addressed to Isidoros,39 an enigmatic figure that\nis mentioned also in the Syriac text (50r2).40\nOn the other hand, the Syriac passage emphasises the central role played by\nbooks in the revelation and transmission of alchemical knowledge. While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes\nreferred to or reused the Enochian myth of the fallen angels. In particular, according to a passage of\nthe alchemist Olympiodorus (CAAG II 89,9\u201315), we know that the above-mentioned treatise\nascribed to Isis (see supra, \u00a7 2), or at least some parts of it, was attributed to Hermes. This overlap\nbetween Hermes and Isis is not surprising, especially if read in the light of the so-called Corpus\nHermeticum, which includes several writings where the Egyptian goddess addresses her teaching\nto Horus (see, for instance, Stobei fragmenta, xxiii\u2013xxvii). Therefore, Zosimus could have had in\nmind Isis\u2019s book, when he mentioned Hermes\u2019s Physika: see Scott, Hermetica, 151.\n\nPages 39:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n15\nalchemical books that have been preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29. In\nfact, among the twelve treatises handed down by the codex under the name of the\nEgyptian alchemist, we find many writings devoted to the dyeing of various metals,\nsuch as silver (e.g. Book 2; Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 217\u201321), tin (Book 8;\nidem, 238\u201342), lead (Book 10; idem, 253\u201357), and iron (Book 11; idem, 257\u201360).41\nIn particular Book 6 (Mm. 6.29, fol. 32xv17\u201345r8), entitled Beginning of the\nTreatise on the Working of Copper: Letter Waw, includes several recipes explaining\nhow to process copper and dye it black, purple, coral red, white, and yellow\n(Berthelot-Duval, La chimie, 222\u201332). Scholars have so far focused their attention\nespecially on the recipes dealing with the production of black copper alloys. Three\nrecipes have been recently published by Erika Hunter and fully commented by\nAlessandra Giumlia-Mair, who recognized in them the description of different\nmethods for producing a black and shiny patina on copper-alloys.42 This black\ncopper was already known in Ancient Egypt, as we can infer, for instance, from a\nbeautiful black image of the pharaoh Amenemhat III (1842\u20131794 BC) today\ndisplayed at the Ortiz Collection in Geneva.43 It represents one of the most ancient\nexamples of artificially black patinated statues found in Egypt (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nIf we go back to the above-quoted Syriac passage, in the very last part Zosimus\ncriticizes the attitude of those alchemists who were only interested in the making of\nprecious metals by quoting a sentence presumably taken from an ancient author\n(perhaps ps.-Democritus) who claimed: \u201cthose who wrote short versions [of the\nbooks of che\u0304meia] said that just silver can be dyed gold\u201d (50r12\u20133). In this way the\ndebate between people supporting a wider idea of alchemy, which included a\nbroader set of dyeing techniques, and people accepting a narrower idea just focused\non the making of gold seems to be traced back to the earliest phases of alchemy in\nEgypt. A possible target of such a criticism might be recognized in Isis\u2019s treatise, a\nwork that mentioned only the making of gold and silver among the secrets revealed\nby the angels. On the contrary, a different position was endorsed by ps.-Democritus\nwith the fourfold division of his books. Significantly, as we have already noted, the\n41\nThe Syriac text of these twelve treatises is still unedited (an edition with English translation is\nscheduled to be published within the new series \u2018Sources of alchemy and chemistry\u2019 distributed as\na supplement of Ambix); a partial French translation is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie,\n210\u201366.\n42\nHunter, \u201cBeautiful Black Bronzes,\u201d 656\u20137. The three recipes that have been edited correspond\nwith the texts translated or summarized by Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 223 (rec. 2), 224\u20135 (rec. 8\u2013\n9), 225 (rec. 12); and Giumlia-Mair, \u201cZosimos the Alchemist,\u201d 319\u201321.\n43\nSee, for example, Giumlia-Mair, \u201cKrokodil.\u201d\n\nPages 40:\n16\nM. Martelli\nFig. 1 Black copper statue of King Amenemhat III in kneeling posture (1843\u20131798 BC) (Courtesy of Werner Forman Archive, The Bridgeman Art Library)\nchemical Papyri seem to preserve a similar division, which should lead us to\nspeculate on how widespread or how standard such a division might actually\nhave been in the first centuries AD.\nSuch a background was well known to Zosimus, who took for granted that\nche\u0304meia was related to a plurality of dyeing techniques. The proper alchemist,\nZosimus claims, was expected to put into practice any possible transformation of\ncolour without focusing only on gold. Nevertheless, the Egyptian alchemist, though\nvery familiar with ps.-Democritus\u2019s books, never mentions stones working and\npurple dyeing in the passage. These kinds of crafts seem to have been somehow left\napart within the debate on the contents of the original books of alchemy. Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\n\nPages 41:\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art\nprimarily focusing on the chromatic transformations of the treated substances. If the\nByzantine sources analysed at the beginning of the chapter emphasizes the identification of che\u0304meia with the making of gold and silver, such a position\u2014although\ndominant to some extent\u2014never interrupted the transmission of technical knowledge dealing with a wider set of dyeing techniques. A similar kind of expertise, for\ninstance, is well attested by the Latin recipe books of the Middle Age, which\ncovered a variety of topics more similar to ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books and to\nthe Leiden and Stockholm papyri than to the simple selection of recipes made by\nPsellos.44 A well-known example is the so-called Mappae clavicula, a large\ncollection of recipes probably assembled between the ninth and the twelfth century.\nRecent studies have shown that this work in all likelihood derives from a lost Greek\nsource that could be perhaps identified, according to Halleux-Meyvaert\u2019s investigation, with a lost part of Zosimus\u2019s treatises.45 Although the extant sources do not\nallow us to confirm such a hypothesis, the Greek origin of the Mappae clavicula\nconfirms the transmission of a set of practices originally covered by those texts\nconsidered at the basis of the Byzantine alchemical tradition. To sum up, the mere\npractice of chrysopoeia does not seem to be sufficient for getting a full understanding of the different historical evolutions of a complex art, whose exact definition\nwas debated even among the authors usually considered as the founders of this\ndiscipline. On the contrary, a deeper investigation of their treatises\u2014many of them\nstill waiting for editions and translations\u2014provide us with new and fresh material\nfor building a more complete picture of the evolution and transformation of the\ndifferent technical aspects somehow encapsulated in the enigmatic word che\u0304meia.\nAppendix\nZosimus\u2019s passage on the relevation of alchemy as preserved by the Syriac manuscript Mm. 6.29, fols. 49r\u201350r:46\n44\nSee, for instance, Halleux, Papyrus de Leyde, 53\u201362.\nHalleux &amp; Meyvaert, \u201cMappae clavicula,\u201d 12\u20133.\n46\nA French translation of the passage is available in Berthelot &amp; Duval, Chimie, 238\u20139.\n45\n\nPages 42:\n18\nM.

Except for some very well-known artistic treatises, e.g. works\nby Eraclius or the Schedula diversarum artium, attributed to Theophilus, detection\nand delimitation of alchemical content within recipe books has been rare and\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of\nabout 40 manuscripts produced in Northern Europe between the fourteenth and the\nsixteenth centuries, this paper investigates the context behind these writings, and the\nvarious ways alchemical and artisanal recipes were embedded within recipe books.\nIt also proposes some clues to assist in locating, identifying and demarcating\nalchemical writings within the literature of recipes.\nIn the Middle Ages and premodern period, alchemical knowledge and practice was\nfrequently transmitted via collections of recipes grouped concomitantly with artistic\ninstructions. Presented in the form of a succession of more or less short notes, these\nS.

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 28 to page 48 out of a total of 220.

For example, the\nfirst alchemists used the word tinctura to refer to the tinting or the dyeing of metals,\nstones or clothes.17 These methods notably explained how to dye metals yellow or\nwhite\u2014so (apparently) how to transmute them into gold or silver. They also\ndescribed various ways to counterfeit precious stones.18 In this context, the term\ntinctura does not relate to the artisanal practice of dyeing, but instead describes the\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people? Previous research has demonstrated that investigating questions related to the authorship and the context of\nproduction behind these texts, as well as their compilation and dissemination,\nelucidates information about the former nature and the previous and current function of these writings.20 Answering these questions would: first, help to better\nestimate the relevance of these books when using them as a historical source for\nreconstructing part of mediaeval and premodern alchemical and artistic knowledge.\nAnd second, examining the various connections and similarities between these two\nfields, as described within recipe books, would serve to (re)situate them in their\nhistorical and cultural contexts.\nThe Sources and the Context of Production\nFirst of all, the wide diversity of subjects and fields embedded within the corpus begs\nthe question: were they written by several authors? A priori, palaeographical examination tends to confirm this: as with a large number of recipe books produced during\nmediaeval and premodern times, the manuscripts examined were written by several\n17\nPrincipe, Secrets of Alchemy, 17; and Clarke, Art of All Colours, 37.\nSee in this volume Matteo Martelli.\n19\nBucklow, \u201cParadigms and Pigment Recipes\u201d; and Principe, Secrets of Alchemy, 35\u20136.\n20\nNeven, Recettes artistiques.\n18\n\nPages 52:\n28\nS. Neven\nhands, and these hands are predominately anonymous. These works thus appear to\nbe the result of collaboration, or at least intervention, by several distinct persons.\nHowever, each person\u2019s contribution cannot necessarily be allocated according to\nthe different subjects in the book. The same hand might be responsible for both a\nmedical treatise and a collection of alchemical or art technological recipes.\nThe manuscripts under consideration were, in fact, the result of copying and\ncompiling of various sources and contributors. More precisely, these recipe books\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources. This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities. Within our corpus several\nalchemical treatises and recipes are attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus\n(c.1190\u20131280), Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c.1240\u20131311) or Roger Bacon (1214\u2013\n1294). Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various\ntitles and were sometimes attributed to diverse authorities.23\nAt this stage, it should be noted that there are also a significant number of texts\ndedicated to religious content bound together with the recipe books under scrutiny.\nThese are theological works, liturgies, extracts from the bible and hagiographies.\nIn fact, a great number of recipe books appear to have been written or compiled within\n21\nMinnis, Theory of Authorship. Concerning the alchemical works attributed to Albertus Magnus\nsee notably Kibre, \u201cAlchemical Writings.\u201d See also Newman, \u201cAlchemy of Roger Bacon.\u201d For\nArnaldus de Villa Nova, see notably Calvet, \u201cTradition alchimique latine.\u201d\n22\nMinnis, Theory of Authorship, 9.\n23\nCalvet, \u201cTradition alchimique latine,\u201d 42.\n\nPages 53:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n29\nreligious institutions, as attested by the citations of ownership. Signatures or monograms within these compilations indicate that these books were copied by scribes and\nmembers of this community. Obviously, the religious institutions\u2014and their libraries\u2014were privileged places, offering scribes the opportunity to copy and compile this\nkind of collection. The Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Cgm 821, Cgm 822 and\nClm 20174, formerly preserved in the Tegernsee monastery library, are good examples: they present not only similarities in terms of the different writings they contain\nbut also, thanks to palaeographical analysis undertaken in the present study, it has\nbeen confirmed that several parts of their respective texts were recorded by the same\nscribe. This would imply that these manuscripts were (at least partially) copied in the\nsame scriptorium, from similar written sources and by the same \u2018hand\u2019.\nReligious institutions may also appear as a contextual factor explaining the\nrapprochement of the various disciplines embedded within the manuscripts. Indeed,\nin general, medical and pharmaceutical recipes had an important place within\nreligious communities. In this regard, art\u2013technological recipes also found their\nplace and could be linked with the art of writing and illuminating involved in\nscriptorial activity. The tables of contents of recipe books can be quite edifying on\nthis point. For example, the table of contents in Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek\nClm 20174 informs us that the artistic instructions were intended for the use of the\nscribes and illuminators of the scriptorium (Et alia multa utilia per scriptoribus et\nilluministarum, Clm 20174, fol. 1). In this context, scribe and illuminator, when not\nrepresented by the same person, worked side by side to produce manuscripts.24 This\ncollaboration led to enhanced communication and the development of a mutual\ninterest in artistic practices among the monastic community.25\nPractical or concrete interest and use of alchemical recipes in religious institutions is less obvious. It has been stated that writers of religious literature sometimes\ndrew parallels with alchemical theories and processes.26 Such writings, which\nobviously borrow alchemical vocabulary and imagery, are not included within our\ncorpus. None of the alchemical texts under scrutiny were found to contain obvious\nreligious connotations. But religious scribes\u2019 personal interest in alchemical craft\nprocedures and practical alchemy in general can be attested by the large number of\nmanuscripts produced that comprise both alchemical treatises and recipes. The\npresence of such instructions is more probably related to a certain attraction of\nalchemy for some monks or friars. Previous studies indeed have established that,\neven if the practice of alchemy was forbidden by several monastic orders, many of\ntheir members were at the root of alchemical (compilations of) texts and Practica.27\nInventories of their library also inform us that they possessed alchemical treatises\n24\nCe\u0301zard, \u201cAlchimie et les recettes techniques,\u201d 6.\nEamon, Secrets of Nature, 36.\n26\nPrincipe &amp; Newman, \u201cHistoriography of Alchemy,\u201d 398\u2013400.\n27\nTheisen, \u201cAttraction of Alchemy.\u201d See also Barthe\u0301lemy, Alchimie de Guillaume Sedacer, 26\u20138.\n25\n\nPages 54:\n30\nS. Neven\nand recipe books.28 Within our corpus, a relevant example is that of Wolfgang Seidel\n(1491\u20131562), prior but also copyist at Tegernsee monastery, who notably wrote two\nKunstb\u20ac\nucher (Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117 and Cgm 4118)\nbetween 1540 and 1550.29 Cgm 4117 and 4118 reflect Seidel\u2019s interests in mathematics, astronomy, natural sciences and alchemy\u2014disciplines in which he acquired\ntheoretical but also practical knowledge. To do so, Seidel is known to have notably\ncollected data from the libraries of Tegernsee but also from the neighbouring\ncloisters. During his stay at St. Ulrich\u2019s and St. Afra\u2019s Abbey (Augsburg), he\nmade use of the abbey\u2019s vast collection of books, as attested in his commentaries\nrecorded in Cgm 4118: \u201cSo many presents I have let copy from the library of the\nCloister St Ulrich in Augsbourg, by a young boy whose name is Walthasar Gech von\nFiessen in the year 1550.\u201d30\nSeidel also seems to have relied on exchanges that are known to have taken place\nwith contemporaries. In fact, in his Kunstb\u20ac\nucher, he cites the authorities from\nwhom he obtained practical information. These were either practitioners\u2014artists\u2014or contemporary scholars. For example, Seidel specifies several times that\nhe is indebted to Bishop Philipp von Freising (1480\u20131541) for some recipes that he\nsubsequently included in Cgm 4117. These prescriptions are notably dedicated to\nthe melting of gold, silver and lead (Cgm 4117, fol. 2v, 37r\u201338v). Seidel also\nmentions Bartholome Schobinger (1500\u20131585), a jurist from St. Gallen.31 The\ninstructions recorded after Schobinger\u2019s name delineated a number of alchemical\nmethods that notably serve to modify the properties of gold, to obtain a golden\ncolour, and to work with gold, silver, iron and copper. Others concern the gilding on\nglass, the melting of ivory, metals and glass, the preparation of aqua fortis and the\nmanufacture of a blue pigment called azure (Cgm 4117, fol. 62r\u2013130r?).\nThese persons were learned persons or scholars, who were interested in natural\nphilosophy and alchemy and who perhaps conducted their own experiments, as\nsuggested by formulae which follow some of the recipes, such as probatum vom\nBischoff von Freising (Cgm 4117, fol. 2v). Schobinger is notably at the root of a\nlarge compilation of alchemical texts.32 He is also renewed for having personally\nknown Paracelsus, who referred to Schobinger\u2019s writings.33 The value of such an\nauthority may appear visually in the recipe book. In the Cgm 4117, Seidel dedicates\na whole page to recording Schobinger\u2019s name.34 Moreover, the simple invocation\n28\nSee, for example, Barthe\u0301lemy, \u201cAlchimie et me\u0301decine,\u201d 110\u20133.\nPaulus, \u201cWolfgang Seidel\u201d; and Po\u0308hlein, Wolfgang Seidel.\n30\n\u201cSo vill vom geschenckh hab ich auss der liberej des closters zw sant vlrich zw Augspurg lassen\nabschreiben durch ain knaben des namen ist Walthasar Gech von Fiessen im 1550 Jahr.\u201d (Munich,\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4118, fol. 128r).\n31\nSchobinger, Schowinger von St. Gallen.\n32\nAllgemeine Deutsche Biographie, 209; and Hertenstein, Joachim von Watt, 91\u20132.\n33\nMeier, Paracelsus, 33\u201346.\n34\n\u201cVon bartholome Schobinger burger zu sanndt Gallen in Schweitz.

Thus, the same way the scribes used to relate old\ntreatises or data with the name of previous and quoted authorities, such as (pseudo)\nAlbertus Magnus or Arnaldus de Villa Nova, they also mention those of their\ncontemporaries to lend authority to validate the practicability or the reproducibility\nof the instructions they consign.35\nIn some cases, the information recorded in recipe books is documented as having\nbeen provided by an artist or practitioner. Augsbourg Staats- und Stadtbibliothek 2\u0001\nCod. 207 was produced in St. Ulrich and St. Afra\u2019s Cloister. It contains miscellaneous alchemical treatises and collections of recipes contributed by several scribes,\nincluding the monk Bild Vitus (1481\u20131529) and Johannes Gossolt (1421\u20131506),\nidentified as vicarius augustensis.36 In this work, Gossolt combined alchemical\ntreatises attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus with Latin and German alchemical\nrecipes. For the latter he sometimes specifies his local sources. For example, at folio\n171v, he mentions the \u201cMagistri Jodoci Aurifabri de Haidelberga.\u201d Other citations\nof goldsmiths\u2019 names are found in our corpus of texts. In the St. Gallen Cod.\nVadiana 395, several alchemical instructions are associated with the name of\n\u201cNicolaus Aurifaber.\u201d In many respects, metalworkers seem to have shared interest\nand knowledge in alchemical practices and materials.37\nThe scribes did not indicate how these data were actually provided and disseminated. At this stage, it is difficult to determine if these recipes were transmitted\norally or only in written form. Oral transmission is usually favoured in specific\ncontexts and environments in which people \u2018physically\u2019 converse.38 In this regard,\nthe workshop or laboratory probably offered the required closeness and the opportunity for oral exchanges and teaching. In the framework of this study, in only a few\ncases has it been possible to establish that a scribe personally met the authority he\ncited, meaning he might have obtained orally the practical information he recorded\nwithin his recipe book. This is notably the case for Seidel and two of the persons he\ncites, von Freising and Schobinger.39 Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that oral data\ncirculated under the rhetoric of the recipe. This standardized and conventional\ntextual format goes hand in hand with the copying process, and, thus, with a written\ntransmission of knowledge. In other cases, exchanges in the form of correspondence are documented. For example, Seidel is also known to have exchanged letters\nwith the monk Vitus, previously quoted, and (partially) responsible for Augsbourg\nStaats- und Stadtbibliothek 2\u0001 Cod. 207.40 Both shared the same interest in natural\nphilosophy, astronomy and alchemy\u2014the same fields addressed within their\nwritings.\n35\nSee notably Halleux, \u201cPratique de laboratoire.\u201d\nThis hand is identified within the Augsbourg, Staats\u2013 und Stadtbibliothek, 2\u0001 Cod. 183, fol. 1r.\n37\nSmith, Body of the Artisan, 140\u201351.\n38\nFox &amp; Woolf, Spoken Word, 259\u201361.\n39\nPfaff, Codex Vadiana, 43.\n40\nNeue Deutsche Biographie, vol. II, 235.\n36\n\nPages 56:\n32\nS. Neven\nFinally, some recipes recorded within the corpus are a scribe\u2019s personal contribution. The acquisition of theoretical but also practical knowledge in natural\nscience and alchemy may have lead Seidel to conduct his own experiments,\nwhich he then recorded in the form of recipes in his books. This possibility is\nconfirmed in the first folio of Cgm 4118, where Seidel explains that he as well as\nboth written (and older) sources and information collected from contemporaries, he\nhad also drawn on his own practical experience.41 The St. Gallen Ms. Vadiana\n429 is an alchemical collection compiled between 1464/65 by Ulrich Ellenbog\n(1435\u20131499), a city physician in Ravensburg. A small part of its content also\nincludes art technological recipes. Ellenbog\u2019s interest and practical knowledge in\n(al)chemy could notably be put in relation with his 1473 pamphlet Von den giftigen\nbesen Temppfen Reuchen der Metal (On the poisonous and noxious vapours and\nfumes of metals). In this writing, the physician gives advices to goldsmiths and\nother metalworkers on how to protect themselves from the noxious effects of\nvapours of silver, mercury and lead.42\nThe Modalities of Composition\nThe diversity of sources and persons who contributed to these collections of recipes\nis evidenced by their varying modalities of composition. Codicological examination\nundertaken during this study has uncovered the (sometimes) very complex processes involved in the creation of recipe books.\nA small number of these writings are produced in the form of carefully presented\nand independent collections: they are written in metallogallic ink and are quite\noften embellished with titles in red, and rubrics. These examples may be relatively\nhomogeneous: usually, only one or two scribes (who are contemporaneous) can be\nidentified and the presentation of their texts is almost identical. Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting). They are informally\nwritten, with no decoration, and are characterized by apparently random presentation\nand inconsistent structure.\nThe recipe titles, which do not always correspond to the procedure that follows\nthem, do not imply a coherent organization. This second type of manuscript was\ncompiled from several contributions and additions from various scribes and\n41\n\u201cDe arte fusoria Rhapsodia partim ex uetusta quadam Biblioteca, partim uero bonorum\namicorum colatione cum sumata, opera autem et labore fratris Wolffgangi Sedelij in vnum collecta\nin solacium et commodum fusorie artis studiosorum.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm\n4118, fol. 1r).\n42\nTeleky, History of Factory, 7; and Koelsch, Geschichte des Arbeitsmedezin, 101.\n\nPages 57:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n33\ncompilers, but also from the accumulation of physically distinct materials\u2014quires\nand folios. Moreover, the diverse sections that make up these books often come\nfrom different geographical locations.\nFrequently, additions and marginal notes attributed to the same scribe or to a\nlater owner punctuate the distinct recipes within the manuscripts. In fact, these\nadditions mostly appear under the form of titles or details given as a counterpart to\nthe instructions. In the Ms. Vadiana 429 from St. Gallen, a great number of\nadditional notes consist of technical commentaries and supplementary notes\nadded to those of the compiler of the manuscript. In the Nuremberg Hs. 33733, a\nlater owner added several titles and remarks within the margins. Some of these\nmarginal additions also mention the name of the person from whom the scribe may\nhave obtained the data he is adding. For example, in the Vienna Ms. 5224, fol.\n74, the scribe indicated the name of a physician, \u201cDoctor Jorg erffordie,\u201d before the\ntitle of a recipe dedicated to the production of sal ammoniac. On folio 105 of the\nsame manuscript, the scribe associated an alchemical procedure with the name\n\u201cMarggrauff von Ro\u0308tell\u201d by mentioning him in the upper margin. This observation\nprovides a possible explanation for the considerable number of unica (isolated\nrecipes) that appear only in one recipe book, and are thus likely to constitute data\ntransmitted personally (and orally?) to the scribe.\nThe method of composition in this kind of recipe book indicates that they were\ncompiled over a more or less long period, during or after peregrinations undertaken\nby their scribes. This is evidenced by notations mentioning different chronological\nperiods and geographical provenances throughout the manuscripts. For example,\nMs. 9715 from Nuremberg contains diverse collections of alchemical recipes. This\nmanuscript was written by several scribes, who give names of persons or magistri\nunderneath the practices they described. They also cite the different places where\nthey collected their data and specify the dates of these events, which span several\nyears. Notably there are several mentions of the \u201cmagistri Johannis Bog\u201d and places\nsuch as \u201cErffordie\u201d (Erfurt), and \u201cKo\u0308ln\u201d (Cologne).43\nMoreover, later additions or annotations found within the manuscripts tend to\nsuggest that these books have been handled, manipulated and passed from one\nowner to another, sometimes over a long period. The Prager Malerbuch had several\nowners and circulated through several localities before entering the monastery of\nZlata\u0301 Koruna. According to a note written by Federl Mir, the main scribe of the\nPrager Malerbuch, this manuscript was written c.1452, in Tittmoning in the district\nof Traunstein (Bavaria). This place probably corresponds to the original provenance\nof the recipe book. Moreover, the scribe tells us that he has gathered data from\nMichel Schril, a professor in Vienna, who passed away in 1472. We also know that\nfrom 1529 to at least 1599, this recipe book belonged to the Preisinger family. This\nfamily lived in Zettwing, in the present-day Czech Republic, between Munich and\n43\nOn Johannis Bog, see fol. 42v, 72v, 157v; on Erfurt, see fol. 49r; and on Cologne, see fol. 50v.\n\nPages 58:\n34\nS. Neven\nVienna. Later, the manuscript is recorded within the inventory of the Zlata\u0301 Koruna\nconvent, as indicated in folio 1r, where we find the date 1649.\nThus, the recording and disseminating of these instructions could go hand in\nhand with the circulation and penetration of alchemical and artistic knowledge\noutside the workshop or the laboratory.44 It could be linked with a (partially oral?)\ntransmission of knowledge that seems to have taken place between (learned)\nscribes, artists or artisans and scholars. Allusions to such exchanges are notably\nto be found in Seidel\u2019s Kunstb\u20ac\nucher. For example, in Cgm 4117, fol. 1v, a recipe is\nstated as coming from a certain Thomas, caster in Munich, and transmitted via\nFreising to Seidel.45 This instruction was placed in an available blank space,\nsituated between the title of one of the book\u2019s sections and the table of contents\n(Fig. 1). It is credited to Seidel, but the handwriting is slightly different from the rest\nof the manuscript text. These observations suggest that this recipe, coming from a\ncontemporary\u2014perhaps oral\u2014source is an isolated and later addition. Moreover,\nscribes sometimes even relate how contemporaneous authorities delivered their\n\u2018secret(s)\u2019 and even divulge the price they had to pay to obtain it. In other cases,\nrecipes are recorded as being offered as a gift pro memoria.46\nContextualising the production and reception of these recipe books thus serves to\nhighlight a large range of individual\u2019s personal\u2019s interest in alchemical and artisanal, as well as other types of knowledge. In this regard, a number of the recipe\nbooks produced in a religious institution are documented as having been later kept\nin a religious context. For example, Berlin Staatsbibliothek Theol. Lat. Quart.\n152, written by \u201cFrater Nicolaus lector\u201d between 1408 and 1412, was owned by\n\u201cFrater Polonus lector principalis\u201d (Johannes Polonus), lector in the Thorn cloister\nduring the fifteenth century. These manuscripts were usually moved to libraries at\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, during the period of secularisation that\nfollowed the French Revolution. In parallel, several examples of our corpus are\ndocumented as being part of private collections and were probably executed for or\ncommissioned by a patron. This is notably the case for the Kodex Berleburg (Bad\nBerleburg, Schlossbibliothek Sayn\u2013Wittgenstein, RT 2/6) which is recorded as\nbeing compiled for Bernhard of Breidenbach (c.1440\u20131497), who worked for the\nchapter of the cathedral of Mayence. Cod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel is a\ncollection of alchemical treatises and instructions\u2014including colour recipes\u2014\nwritten around 1441\u20131444 by several hands. A note on the binding informs us\nthat this volume probably belonged to the Bavarian physician Johannes Hartlieb\n(1410\u20131468), who wrote several compendia notably the Puch aller verpoten kunst,\nungelaubens und der zaubrey (1456).47\n44\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 342.\n\u201cVom Jungen thoman giesser zw munchen durch den bischoff von freising.\u201d (Munich,\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, fol. 1v).\n46\nSee Corbett, \u201cAlchimiste Le\u0301onard de Mauperg.\u201d\n47\n\u201cSum magistri Iohannis Hartliep, alias Walsporn, Vangionensis\u201d; on Hartlieb, see Fu\u0308rbeth,\nJohannes Hartlieb; for the edition of the text, see Eisermann &amp; Graf, Johannes Hartlieb.\n45\n\nPages 59:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n35\nFig. 1 Additional instruction due to Seidel, Munchen, Cgm 4117, fol. 1rv (Courtesy of\nMu\u0308nchener Digitalierungszentrum)\nThe Function(s) of Recipe Books\nThe complex modalities of composition and diffusion of these texts raises some\nquestions regarding their nature and their original function. At this stage, two\ndifferent hypotheses have been put forward regarding the aim of this type of\nliterature. On the one hand, these texts have been seen as manuals that may have\nbeen used by practitioners. On the other hand, the recipes often seem to have been\ntransmitted for the purposes of literary preservation, not directly connected with\ncontemporary workshop or laboratory practices.48\nFirst of all, the textual environment and the diversity of the subjects bound\ntogether with the artistic and alchemical recipes in a same book, lead to the\nconclusion that these compilations were mainly read by scholars primarily interested in natural philosophy and were not intended for contemporary practical use.\nMoreover, it has been frequently stated that craft practices were transmitted orally,\n48\nClarke, \u201cCodicological Indicators\u201d; and Neven, Recettes artistiques, 16\u201323.\n\nPages 60:\n36\nS. Neven\nfrom the master to the apprentice.49 A large number of the manuscripts of this study\nresult from copying and compilation processes undertaken by scribes. As they were\ncopied in a context outside the workshop or the laboratory, these recipes were not\nrevised and, consequently, conveyed an anachronistic technical tradition that\nbecame more and more outdated.\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities\nlinked to \u2018authorship\u2019.50 Scribes also made attempts to ensure that the recipes could\nbe consulted at need: they composed tables of contents or indexes, they introduced\ntitles within the margins and many other details which attest to a real desire to\ndeliver usable information. In this context the marginal notes and additions made by\nthe scribes/authors of the recipe book are of interest as most of them are technical\ncomments testifying practical interest in both alchemical and artistic instructions.\nSeveral marginal annotations due to Seidel\u2019s hand punctuate the Cgm 4117 and\nconsist in personal commentaries regarding the technical procedures he records.\nFor example, on folio 53r, Seidel compares two ways for the melting of crystal.\nConcerning the first process he states in the margin that this \u2018art\u2019 was not of use to\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates\nanother method for the same technical procedure, giving as title \u201cHow one should\nmasterfully melt crystal.\u201d52\nIn this sense, the scribes at the root of these recipe books created not simply a\ncopy but a unique work, which reflected their own interests, their cultural and life\ncontext and sometimes their intention, which was to deliver practical and useful\ninstruction.\n49\nHalleux, Entre technologie et alchimie, 7.\nFor this definition of authorship, see notably Love, Attributing Authorship, 32\u201340.\n51\n\u201cDise kunst prauchet ich nit hinden amm 219 hastu vil pessere.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, fol. 53r)\n52\n\u201cWie man christallen maisterlich giessen soll.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm\n4117, fol. 219)\n50\n\nPages 61:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n37\nReliability of Recipe Books\nThe modalities of composition and diffusion of these recipe books have an impact\non their current (practical) use. During the compiling and disseminating processes,\nboth alchemical and art-technological collections of recipes were subject to mutations, in the form of interpolation, reduction, contamination or assimilation with\nother texts. As the recipe books evolved and were modified by adding new texts and\nprocedures, the recipes themselves could be modified in their technical formulations during their transmission from one manuscript to another. Assimilation with\nother texts occurs quite frequently, as the ingredients (and the actions) specified in\nthese texts appear in the artistic recipe books but also in medical treatises, cookery\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts. Frequently, the copyist was free to add,\nto remove or to omit some words or even some parts of the text. These modifications or omissions sometimes concern primary data, such as the name of the\ningredients or materials, or may be related to some of the steps of the procedure.\nAt each stage of the copying process, variations or errors can occur. This phenomenon can be explained in several ways: it could be an attempt to improve or to\ndiversify a previous formula; it could be a quid pro quo, in which an unknown or\nexpensive ingredient is substituted with a more well known or less expensive one; it\nmay have been a voluntary reduction of the recipe text.\nIf we suppose that the function of a recipe book was practical or instructive, this\nfunction could be the motivation behind changes to the recipes. An author or a scribe\nmay, voluntarily, have corrected the text, or added information to it. However,\nchanges to the recipe may also be due to a misunderstanding of the procedure.\nSuch miscomprehension may be due to palaeographical problems that resulted in a\nword being misread or misunderstood and thus replaced by another. This was a\nlikely occurrence if the copyist was not a practitioner or if he was not able to\ntranslate or to decipher an unreadable formula. For example, in Heidelberg Cod. Pal.\nGerm. 183, fol. 286, at the beginning of a recipe dedicated to the production of\nminium, the scribe mentions the use of \u201cLautterm sapienticum\u201d instead of Lutum\nsapientium. In Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Cgm 824, the scribe describes\nthe preparation of a white (fol. 13r), a yellow (fol. 13r), a blue (fol. 14v) and a grey\npigment (fol. 14v), and each time suggests taking \u201ccretam rosam.\u201d53 The same\ninstructions are recorded in the Cgm 822 (fol. 64v) where the scribe correctly\nindicates the use of cretam rasam (scraped chalk).\nSuch phenomena\u2014reduction, amplification, variation\u2014may result in a procedure whose description can seem vague or unclear and thus thwart the current use\nand relevance of recipe books in the study and the reconstruction of historical\nartistic practices.\n53\nMy italics.\n\nPages 62:\n38\nS. Neven\nAlchemical and Art-Technological Recipes Within\na Manuscript: Location, Relationship and Distinction\nSimilarities of format and modalities of composition and diffusion may have had an\nimpact on the recording and assembling of alchemical and art-technological recipes\nwithin the same manuscript. This could notably result in the mixing and grouping of\ndifferent types of unrelated instructions.\nMore precisely, in the corpus under scrutiny, alchemical instructions appear\neither as independent pieces of work, or as isolated (groups of) recipe(s) embedded\nwith artistic or other types of instructions. In the first case, alchemical content may\nappear concurrently with an artist\u2019s recipe book within the same manuscript but in a\nseparate section. When this occurs, the texts mostly consist of quite theoretical\nalchemical treatises, often associated with the name of a former or contemporary\nauthority. Most of them are attributed to the (pseudo) Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon\nand Arnaldus de Villa Nova whose writings date from an earlier period. These works\ncould also be \u2018physically\u2019 distinct works, delimited to a quire or a booklet\u2014or even a\nfolio\u2014and assembled with the rest of the manuscript at a contemporary or later\nperiod. Vienna Ms. 5224 contains various alchemical collections of recipes and\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios. These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.\nAlchemical texts are also sometimes situated alongside an artists\u2019 recipe book,\neither before or after. If this is the case, they will be found next to technical\ninstructions dedicated to procedures similar to those described in an alchemical\ncontext, such as the imitation of gold or silver, the gilding of stones or glass, the\nmanufacture of vermilion, the purification of ultramarine, the melting of stones or\nmetals, or several dyeing procedures. The alchemical content may be delimited\nwithin the title(s), chapter(s) or table of contents or \u2018physically\u2019 circumscribed by a\nfolio or a quire. But, in most cases, there is no obvious delimitation between the two\ndistinct collections of recipes. For example, in Nuremberg Germanisches\n54\nIdentified as \u2018hand\u2019 4 in the catalogue notes, he is responsible for fol. 31v, 38r\u2013120v, 123r\u2013143r,\n153r\u2013157v, 160r\u2013163r.\n\nPages 63:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n39\nNationalmuseum Ms. 5078b (fol. 2r\u201341r), the scribe moves from one subject to\nanother with no indication that the subject has changed. Moreover, this set of\nalchemical and art-technological recipes is followed with no clear distinction\n(no title, nor blank space) by a series of medical prescriptions due to the same hand.\nIn another case\u2014isolated (groups of) alchemical recipes found in the middle of\nprescriptions of another type\u2014detection of alchemical content and distinction from\nartistic instructions within recipe books can be fraught with difficulty. Similarities in\nterms of their textual format probably lead scribes to group them with other sort of\nprescriptions. When found as isolated elements, alchemical and art technological\nrecipes usually appear within a large broad of various (and unrelated) writings.\nFor example, part of Nuremberg Hs. 3227 (fol. 74v\u201381v, 90v\u2013164v) is a miscellanea\nof cooking, alchemical, household and artistic recipes, written by the same hand.\nHeidelberg Cod. Pal. Germ 678 notably includes a collection of medical recipes\ninterrupted by one single alchemical recipe, dedicated to the manufacture of vermilion.\nIn Berlin Theol. Lat. Quart. 152, some isolated alchemical recipes are placed in the\nmiddle of several cooking recipes and within religious texts.\nFinally, some recipes were never granted their own place within a collection of\nrecipes. An isolated recipe is sometimes jotted down on any available space on a\npage or squeezed into an even less appropriate place. For example, in Nuremberg\nMs. 27773, recipes dedicated to the colouring of glass and the hardening of steel\nappear under the form of later additions in the upper and lower margin of a school\nbook, and probably also on the binding board.\nThus reading these collections and attempting to categorise the recipes as\nalchemical or art-technological can be less than straightforward. After examining\nthe corpus in question the following suggestions are proposed to help identify the\ndifferent recipes.\nAs stated above, whether alchemical or art-technological, the recipes contained\nin these manuscripts are presented in the form of a formula which, in most cases,\nenumerates the ingredients and the actions necessary to produce a particular\npreparation. In addition artistic recipes sometimes indicate the recommended\ngeographical provenance or grade of quality of the ingredients. Suggestions for\npossible substitutions might also appear. This sort of information is rare in alchemical recipes.\nThe length of a recipe depends not only on the number of ingredients involved\nbut also on its complexity, the number of steps necessary to obtain the final product.\nA recipe can be anything from one sentence to several pages within a manuscript.\nAlternatively, a recipe may appear merely as a brief list of ingredients, without any\nother additional information. In fact, two categories of recipe can be distinguished:\nthe Vollrezepte (detailed recipes) and the Kurzrezepte (abbreviated recipes).55 In\nthe first, the quantities and the various steps are indicated. In the second, only the\n55\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 343.\n\nPages 64:\n40\nS. Neven\ningredients are cited: the procedure is sketched out or omitted altogether and the\nrest is left to the ingenuity of the user. This second category is more common in the\ncase of artistic recipes; a great many of the recipes dedicated to the manufacture of\nink are written in the form of a very short list of ingredients. It is less common for\nthe alchemical recipes to be presented this way.\nThe title of a recipe may also give an indication of the final product to be obtained\nand, in some cases, specify the use of the product. Again, this is particularly true for\nartistic instructions and is less observable for alchemical ones.\nFor both types of instructions (alchemical or artistic), some steps could be\nomitted or were left to the interpretation of the reader. Specified quantities may\nbe missing in both fields. When quantities are given, artistic recipes are far more\nlikely to use local measurements, whereas in alchemical instructions, the quantities\u2014if mentioned at all\u2014are more often expressed in terms of ratio or proportions.\nIn some cases, these proportions are not \u2018practically\u2019 correct. A very well-known\nexample is the proportion of mercury and sulphur proposed by mediaeval recipes\nfor the production of vermilion which is invariably incorrect.56 Very rarely are the\ncorrect chemical proportions cited.\nIn parallel, alchemical writings may involve the use of symbols or metaphors to\ndesignate substances and practices. In consequence, the way an alchemical recipe\nwas received would depend on the degree of experience of the reader-practitioner\nreading it. On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy. On the other hand, the omitted information may have\nbeen complemented by data only known to some readers and not recorded by the\ncopyist who conserves only the essential part of the recipe. If so then this kind of\nrecipe was only meant to be accessible and useable by those practitioners who could\neasily fill in the lacuna that punctuated the text of the recipe.\nAs previously observed, citations of authority were frequently used by the scribes\nof the manuscripts. However, the tendency for an older authority to be cited in the\nrecipe books is particularly characteristic of the alchemical writings and less typical\nof the art-technological recipes. As stated above, such citations primarily served to\nlegitimate the technical and chemical procedures. In addition, most alchemical\nrecipes describe processes and practical results to validate previously enounced\ntheoretical principles. Thus, more than artistic recipes, alchemical instructions\nemphasize the efficacy of the procedure which is frequently confirmed through\nexpressions such as expertum es or probatum est which are placed at the beginning\nor end of the instructions. The notion of experimenta (testing) implies the acquisition or confirmation of theoretical knowledge through direct observation and experimentation rather than through analysis based on rational arguments.57 In such a case,\nwhen one of these reassuring expressions appears at the end (or the beginning) of a\nrecipe, it does not signify that the recipe has actually been tested by the scribe.\n56\n57\nBucklow, \u201cParadigms and Pigment Recipes,\u201d 144.\nHalleux, \u201cPratique de laboratoire.\u201d\n\nPages 65:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n41\nRather it implies that the recipe constitutes a plausible set of instructions, and has\nbeen successfully performed at least once and/or confirmed by a previous authority.\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59\nConclusion\nExamination of the processes of making, compiling and disseminating this corpus\nof mediaeval and premodern recipe books provides us with information concerning\ntheir nature and former function. One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person. Both the context of their production and the similarities in\n58\nNewman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate,\u201d 434, 442\u20135.

These first\nobservations tend to suggest that these recipe books were produced for literary\npurposes and to preserve existing knowledge. And, indeed, these compilations were\nmainly read by a scholarly public primarily interested in natural philosophy,\nastrology, and alchemy and were probably not intended for practical use within\nthe workshop or the laboratory.\nMoreover, as these books are the result of compilation and additions of data, the\nfinding and the delimitation of alchemical content can be complicated, especially\nwhen isolated (groups of) recipe(s) were recorded in the middle of unrelated\n(collection(s) of) text(s). By displaying the various ways alchemical and artistic\nrecipes are embedded within the same manuscript, this study has highlighted the\npotential difficulties in localizing and distinguishing them.\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that recipe books partly derived\nfrom the recording and transmission of (more or less) contemporaneous practices.\nThus, recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of\nboth scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers\nor authorities. Recipe books also serve to define a more precise network in which\nthese types of knowledge circulated, delivering information about the \u2018actors\u2019\u2014\nwhether artisans, scholars, natural philosophers, (theoretical) alchemists or lay\nscribes\u2014and their interconnections, as well as the media (copy, oral source,\nexperiment) they used to exchange, share and communicate art and alchemy.\n\nPages 67:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n43\nAppendix: List of Manuscripts\nAugsbourg, Staatsbibliothek\n\u2013 2\u0001 Cod 207, c.1514\nScribe:\nJohannes Gossolt and Bild Vitus (1481\u20131529), monk at St Ulrich in\nAugsburg\nLanguage: Latin and German\n\u2013 2\u0001 Cod 572, before 1446 (part 2)\u20131446 (part 1)\nLanguage: partly written in Swabian (part 1) and Bavarian (part 2) dialects\n\u2013 4\u0001 Cod 131, 15th\u201316th century (the recipes)\nLanguage: German\n\u2013 4\u0001 Cod 149, c.1501\u20131519\nScribe:\nLeonhard Wagner\nowner:\nLanguage: Schwabian\nOrigin:\nwritten in Augsbourg (St Ulrich and Afra), Irsee, St Gallen, Lorsch\nBad Berleburg, Schlossbibliothek Sayn-Wittgenstein\n\u2013 RT 2/6 Kodex Berleburg, c.1475\u20131478\nLanguage:\nFranconian and Latin\nOrigin:\nRhine Main\nPrevious\nBernhard of Breidenbach, (who worked for the chapter of the\nowner:\nCathedral of Mayence)\nBamberg, Staatsbibliothek\n\u2013 L III 33, 16th century\nLanguage: Middle German\n\nPages 68:\n44\nS.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document summary from pages 51 to 73 reveals the following details about the transmission of alchemical and artisanal knowledge in medieval Germany:

- <strong>Intertwining of Alchemical and Artisanal Practices:</strong> Alchemical treatises and artisanal recipe books shared similar linguistic structures, including the use of verbs such as &quot;grind,&quot; &quot;mix,&quot; and &quot;purify,&quot; highlighting the shared methodologies between alchemists and artisans.
  
- <strong>Use of Alchemical Terminology:</strong> Terms like &quot;mercury&quot; and &quot;sulfur&quot; were used in both alchemical and artistic contexts, sometimes referring to actual substances and at other times representing philosophical principles of transformation. This demonstrates the philosophical and material blending of alchemical and artisanal knowledge.
  
- <strong>Compilation of Manuscripts:</strong> Recipe books were frequently collaborative, created by scribes and practitioners, and often drew from a wide variety of written and oral sources. Many of these texts were preserved and produced in religious institutions, which acted as hubs for the transmission of both alchemical and artistic knowledge.

### Choice Quotes:
- &quot;Both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions, and ingredients. So both used an identical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a &#x27;step-by-step&#x27; procedure.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51)

- &quot;The manuscripts under consideration were, in fact, the result of copying and compiling of various sources and contributors... The same hand might be responsible for both a medical treatise and a collection of alchemical or art technological recipes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 52](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52)

A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and\nworkshops. In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures. By the seventeenth century, the expertise of some glassmakers,\nsilver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of\nalchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the\nlaboratory.24 Lawrence Principe and Morgan Wesley discuss two examples of\nsuch arts: silversmithing and porcelain production, respectively.\n21\nFor \u2018trading zones\u2019 between artisanal and scholarly cultures, see Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success.

Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41.

The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14,15\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15\nFor reading and writing as alchemical practices, see Nummedal, \u201cWords and Works,\u201d and the\nliterature quoted there.\n16\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, 115\u201363.\n17\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations, 11\u201327.\n18\nFor experts and entrepreneurial alchemy, see Nummedal, Alchemy and Authority, 40\u20135.\nxiv\nIntroduction\nIt is in this context of alchemical expertise that we should consider the artisans\nwho adopted the language of alchemy in the early modern period to attract the\nattention of patrons. One example can be seen in the description of Black Berthold,\nthe legendary discoverer of gunpowder in Europe, in the late fifteenth-century\nmanuscript Feuerwerckbuch. Depicted in the company of a furnace and alembics,\nBerthold\u2019s creation of ordnance is identified with alchemy.

Artisanal workshops,\nsuch as Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (c.1435\u20131488) in which Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u2013\n1519) apprenticed or Leonardo\u2019s own workplace, shared a material culture with\nalchemical laboratories. As we have already pointed out, artisans used similar\nequipment and performed \u201cchemical\u201d operations. However, Bernardoni argues,\nBiringuccio made the claim that these artisans were the true experts on matter,\nmaterials and material transformation and that artisanal \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nthe key to natural knowledge.\nOne of the readers of Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia was Johannes Mathesius (1504\u2013\n1565), a Lutheran preacher in St. Joachimsthal, the center of an important mining\ndistrict.

This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17\nPages: 17,18\nat Renaissance courts.

In fact, in the early modern period, they were often so similar in terms of the\ninstruments they contained that they carried the same name. This material culture\nremained largely the same. A change took place at another level: the increasing\npresence of books and texts in laboratories and workshops populated by figures who\nmerged artisanal and scholarly cultures.

Silver- and\ngoldsmiths could also become involved themselves in transmutational endeavours.\nIn his contribution to this book, Principe focuses on the brothers Anthoni and\nAndries Grill (1604\u20131655) as examples of such hybrid figures. They ran successful\nsilversmithing businesses in mid-seventeenth century Amsterdam and The Hague.\nAnthoni Grill\u2019s Amsterdam laboratory also produced work on transmutation for]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204\nPages: 204\nhands. At the time of Biringuccio\u2019s writing, the potter\u2019s art was on the threshold of a\nparadigm shift that would create a marked division between craft knowledge and\ntheory based practice, setting two separate courses for ceramic innovation in the\nlater sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His citation of alchemy as one of \u201ctwo\nsources as [pottery\u2019s] principal basis,\u201d is referential to the provision of purified\nminerals and \u201celemental mixtures.\u201d5 However, it also foreshadowed the intellectual\nengagement of chymists in the quest for the production of European porcelain,\nbringing the weight of the older alchemical tradition to bear.\nPrior to the fourteenth century, European pottery was external to the hierarchy of\nthe esteemed arts, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, painting, and dyeing.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The intertwining of alchemical and artisanal knowledge is a central theme in the document, showing how alchemists and artisans shared practical knowledge, particularly in metallurgy, glassmaking, and ceramics. Here are key insights on this intersection:

1. <strong>Goldsmiths and Silversmiths as Key Figures</strong>: Gold- and silversmiths frequently engaged with alchemical processes such as assaying, refining, and distillation. Their workshops often contained the necessary equipment for chymical (early chemical) operations, creating a space where alchemy and artisanal craftsmanship merged. The artisans&#x27; hands-on expertise with materials like gold and silver made them valuable collaborators with alchemists, who sought to transmute metals and explore the properties of materials [Laboratories of Art, page 180](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180).

2. <strong>Artisanal Processes and Alchemical Knowledge</strong>: Artisans and alchemists shared an interest in the transformation of matter, whether through coloring glass or purifying metals. Both fields emphasized craft practices, with recipe books documenting similar processes for improving the properties of materials, either for artistic or functional purposes. This led to significant epistemic exchanges between the two fields [Laboratories of Art, page 79](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79).

3. <strong>Artisans Bridging the Scholarly and Practical Worlds</strong>: By the 17th century, artisans such as glassmakers, goldsmiths, and porcelain producers became important figures who combined alchemical knowledge with hands-on craftsmanship. These hybrid figures contributed to both the advancement of artisanal crafts and the development of alchemical practices, blurring the line between the scholarly and practical domains [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16).

Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors.

Vigorous disagreements and successive innovations characterized\nvirtually its entire history, and most of all, its early modern existence. On the\nbroadest scale, opinions varied in regard to what chymistry\u2019s main goals should\ninclude\u2014chrysopoeia (metallic transmutation), chemiatria (medicinal applications), commercial production, and so on. Even within any one of these important\nbranches, both theoretical frameworks and practical approaches varied widely.\nWhat was the correct hidden composition of metals, and of matter more generally?\nWhat was the correct starting material for the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and how should]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty.

Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.

This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26,27\n2\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n3\nThe passage comes after a long introduction (\u00a7\u00a7 1\u20134) in which Psellos rhetorically\ndiscusses the philosophical framework within which chrysopoeia is to be understood and assessed. At the very beginning (\u00a7 1, ll. 5f.) the scholar identifies the main\ntopic of his letter with \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (the art of fire), whose first aim is said to be\nthe transformation of lead, tin, and any other metal into gold (\u00a7 1, ll. 12\u201315). The\nkey concept of transformation is framed and expanded in the following paragraphs\n(\u00a7\u00a7 2\u20134), where Psellos tries to set the basic principles guiding his \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2\n(scientific) explanation of this art. He insists on the four elements that compose the\nphysical world, on their reciprocal changes, and on the alterations of the four\nqualities (namely wet, dry, hot, and cold). These changes are explained through]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=109\nPages: 109\nmetals.\nThe structure of the book and the line of his argumentation shows that Albertus\nat one point had to face the question of transmutation: if metals are formed from\nprimordial matter consisting of a mixture of the four elements, i.e. from a mixture of\nsulphur and mercury as substances in between the basic elements and the finished\nmetals, and if metals are constantly emerging as defined species, then this logically\nleads to a discussion of whether one metal can be transformed into another as the\nalchemists claim. Albertus does not totally dismiss the possibility of transmutation,\nbut\u2014as a follower of Aristotle\u2014accepts the theoretical possibility, without showing particular interest in this question, when he states:\nWe do not intend here to show how any one of these may be transmuted into another, or\nhow, by the remedy of that medicine the alchemists call the elixir, their diseases may be\ncured, or their occult properties made manifest, or conversely their manifest properties be]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=108\nPages: 108,109\npower to achieve the destined form.\nHere Albertus merges an alchemical concept with ideas from Aristotle extracted\nfrom his Generation of Animals. He equates a female principle with the material\ncause, i.e. the shapeless matter, subjected to an efficient cause, a forming principle\nthat is inherent in the male semen. To initiate this transformational process Albertus\nintroduces the celestial bodies as impulses. After discussing the material and\nefficient cause he then treats the third, the formal cause, where he follows Aristotle\nwho said that the male principle contributes the form of the offspring, i.e. the\n14\n15\nAlbertus, Book of Minerals, XXXI.\nAristoteles, \u201cMeteorologie,\u201d 136.\n86\nH.

One example can be seen in the description of Black Berthold,\nthe legendary discoverer of gunpowder in Europe, in the late fifteenth-century\nmanuscript Feuerwerckbuch. Depicted in the company of a furnace and alembics,\nBerthold\u2019s creation of ordnance is identified with alchemy.

But instead we shall show how they are mixed from the elements, and how each\none is constituted in its own specific form.16\nAlbertus, with his system and his reception of ancient philosophical considerations, had a strong influence on the early modern period: he describes properties of\nthe metals like colour, malleability, melting point and so forth as accidental\nproperties of the metals. The ancient and medieval search for the causes and the\nprinciples proceeded to dominate early modern metallogenetic theories. The progeny of these Aristotelean-Albertian concepts are found everywhere in Mathesius,\nwho says about silver:\nMassive or compact silver is the name for what is pure and nearly fine and can be cut and\nembossed, before it is put in the fire.

In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Alchemy&#x27;s role in material transformation extended far beyond the pursuit of turning base metals into gold, often embodying a more expansive set of goals related to the manipulation of substances. This included practical applications such as the creation of dyes, the development of glassmaking techniques, and advancements in metallurgy.

### Key Themes on Material Transformation:
1. <strong>Broader Scope of Alchemy:</strong>
   Alchemy was not limited to the transmutation of metals (chrysopoeia) but also involved the production of various materials used in the visual and decorative arts. This extended to the making of medicines, porcelain, and dyes, and it was deeply intertwined with art technologies. Alchemists documented these transformations in recipe books, some dating back to the third century, which provided step-by-step instructions for creating luxury goods like imitation gemstones and textile dyes. [Laboratories of Art, page 13](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13).

2. <strong>Imitation of Natural Processes:</strong>
   Alchemists and artisans shared a common interest in replicating and improving natural processes. Whether in the purification of metals or the transmutation of materials, both alchemists and goldsmiths sought to imitate the processes of nature. For instance, goldsmiths and alchemists collaborated on techniques for purifying metals, which often paralleled each other’s work. [Laboratories of Art, page 121](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121).

3. <strong>Alchemy as an Art and Science:</strong>
   Alchemical recipes frequently detailed the apparatus and tools necessary for chemical transformations, offering precise descriptions of the stages involved in changing materials from their original to perfected states. Alchemy was seen as both a mechanical art, dealing with the practical manipulation of matter, and a liberal art, explaining the composition and transformation of materials on a more theoretical level. [Laboratories of Art, pages 48-49](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48).

4. <strong>Overlap with Art Technologies:</strong>
   Both alchemy and art technologies shared a focus on transmutation, especially in processes involving color change. Whether it was the coloring of glass, the imitation of precious metals, or the production of artificial gemstones, both fields employed similar chemical processes. These processes were documented in alchemical and artistic recipe books, highlighting the interconnectedness of the two disciplines.

In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas.

Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92\nPages: 92\nremained to Biringuccio the most important \u201cart\u201d for studying the secrets of nature:\nThus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art [alchemy] is the origin and\nfoundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.\nBut he who practices it must be ignorant neither of cause nor of natural effects, and not too\npoor to support the expense. Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41. For the Italian, see Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977),]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16,15\ncarved out space for true alchemy as one of the arts of fire. Artisanal workshops,\nsuch as Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (c.1435\u20131488) in which Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u2013\n1519) apprenticed or Leonardo\u2019s own workplace, shared a material culture with\nalchemical laboratories. As we have already pointed out, artisans used similar\nequipment and performed \u201cchemical\u201d operations. However, Bernardoni argues,\nBiringuccio made the claim that these artisans were the true experts on matter,\nmaterials and material transformation and that artisanal \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nthe key to natural knowledge.\nOne of the readers of Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia was Johannes Mathesius (1504\u2013\n1565), a Lutheran preacher in St. Joachimsthal, the center of an important mining\ndistrict.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document emphasizes the profound intertwining between artisanal processes and alchemical knowledge, particularly in the early modern period. Here are key themes and insights on how these two areas intersected:

1. <strong>Shared Practices Between Alchemy and Artisanal Work:</strong>
   Alchemy and artisanry shared many practical techniques, particularly in fields like metallurgy, glassmaking, and ceramics. Both disciplines involved purifying and transforming materials, with recipes often describing chemical processes similar to those practiced by contemporary artisans. Alchemists and artisans both relied on craft-based practices to manipulate substances, whether to improve their properties or transform them into more valuable forms, like the coloring of glass or the refining of metals [Laboratories of Art, page 48](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48).

2. <strong>Goldsmiths and Silversmiths as Key Figures:</strong>
   The work of gold- and silversmiths provides a clear example of how artisans employed alchemical processes in their craft. These tradesmen were involved in chemical operations like refining metals, distillation, and smelting, sharing a knowledge base with alchemists. Both alchemists and goldsmiths assumed that metals were composed of sulfur and quicksilver and used similar techniques to imitate God’s creative processes in nature [Laboratories of Art, page 121](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121).

3. <strong>Recipe Books as a Medium for Transmission:</strong>
   Recipe books from the medieval and early modern periods often contained both alchemical and artisanal instructions, reflecting the overlap between the two fields. These texts, particularly in German-speaking regions, were widely disseminated, and the similarities in their content demonstrate the mutual influence of alchemical knowledge and artistic processes. Many of these books were produced in religious institutions, where scribes compiled and copied instructions that combined alchemical theories with practical artisanal techniques [Laboratories of Art, pages 48, 62](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62).

4. <strong>Empirical Focus of Alchemy vs. Artistic Recipes:</strong>
   Alchemical recipes placed a greater emphasis on the transformation of matter at a fundamental level compared to artistic recipes, which focused more on the visual and physical properties of materials. Alchemists sought to manipulate primary qualities of substances, whereas artists were more concerned with secondary qualities, such as color and texture [Laboratories of Art, page 65](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65).

This intersection of alchemical knowledge with artisanal processes shows how both fields contributed to the advancement of material sciences and the development of artistic and decorative technologies.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nthe field of \u2018science and technology of matter\u2019.\nIf we focus our attention on all the artisanal processes of substance transformation known and practiced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is easy to\nshow that they do not fit perfectly within the domain traced by alchemy. This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16,17\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23\nOn hybrid experts, see Klein, \u201cArtisanal-Scientific Experts,\u201d and \u201cDepersonalizing the Arcanum.\u201d\n24\nFor glassmaking (not discussed here), see Beretta, Alchemy of Glass; and Dupre\u0301, \u201cValue of\nGlass.\u201d\n22\nxvi\nIntroduction\nSilver- and goldsmiths seem obvious candidates when we think of careers that\ncross artisan and alchemist. Silversmiths, goldsmiths and alchemists worked on the\nsame materials (silver and gold), and silver- and goldsmiths\u2019 expertise was called\nfor to assay the purported gold and silver transmuted by alchemists. Silver- and\ngoldsmiths could also become involved themselves in transmutational endeavours.\nIn his contribution to this book, Principe focuses on the brothers Anthoni and\nAndries Grill (1604\u20131655) as examples of such hybrid figures. They ran successful\nsilversmithing businesses in mid-seventeenth century Amsterdam and The Hague.\nAnthoni Grill\u2019s Amsterdam laboratory also produced work on transmutation for]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=125\nPages: 125,126\nBetween Maker and Nature.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of artisans bridging the scholarly and practical worlds is well-explored in *Laboratories of Art*, focusing on how artisans in fields like glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production contributed to both scholarly and practical knowledge. Here are key insights:

1. <strong>Hybrid Figures in Laboratories and Workshops:</strong>
   Artisans often straddled the line between hands-on craftsmanship and scholarly pursuits. By the 17th century, certain crafts, particularly glassmaking and silversmithing, required artisans to be well-versed in both alchemical processes and scholarly learning. These artisans occupied a unique position, acting as intermediaries who combined practical knowledge with theoretical understanding in areas like metallurgy and material transformation. They often worked in laboratories that were indistinguishable from artisanal workshops in terms of the tools and instruments used [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16).

2. <strong>Porcelain Production as a Case Study:</strong>
   Porcelain makers like Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus successfully bridged the gap between traditional potter’s skills and chemical knowledge. Their work relied heavily on alchemical techniques to perfect porcelain production, blending artisanal practice with scholarly chemistry. This fusion of craft and science in the early modern period exemplified how artisans moved beyond mere manual labor to engage in theoretical investigation, advancing both the decorative arts and material sciences [Laboratories of Art, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17).

3. <strong>Gold- and Silversmiths as Alchemical Collaborators:</strong>
   Goldsmiths and silversmiths, due to their work with precious metals, were natural collaborators with alchemists. Their workshops were equipped with similar apparatus used in alchemy, such as furnaces and crucibles. These artisans often participated in refining and transmutational processes, contributing to alchemical experiments. Anthoni Grill, a notable silversmith in Amsterdam, ran a successful business while simultaneously conducting alchemical transmutations, demonstrating how artisans contributed to and benefited from scholarly alchemical knowledge [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16).

4. <strong>Artisanal Knowledge in Scholarly Contexts:</strong>
   Artisans played an essential role in the transmission of knowledge. Works of art such as the &quot;Handstein&quot; (a prized object for goldsmiths) became symbolic of the metallogenetic knowledge artisans possessed. This type of object held value not just for its material worth but for the embodied knowledge it represented, influencing both elite collectors and scholarly cultures. The &quot;Handstein&quot; exemplified the crossover between practical craftsmanship and intellectual inquiry in early modern Europe [Laboratories of Art, page 122](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122).

During the compiling and disseminating processes,\nboth alchemical and art-technological collections of recipes were subject to mutations, in the form of interpolation, reduction, contamination or assimilation with\nother texts. As the recipe books evolved and were modified by adding new texts and\nprocedures, the recipes themselves could be modified in their technical formulations during their transmission from one manuscript to another. Assimilation with\nother texts occurs quite frequently, as the ingredients (and the actions) specified in\nthese texts appear in the artistic recipe books but also in medical treatises, cookery\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts. Frequently, the copyist was free to add,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=50\nPages: 50\nemotional purpose.14 A great number of these writings share the same format and\nare quite similar in terms of their external and internal characteristics. Within these\ncompilations, the recipe frequently appears as the \u201cshortest element in which the\ntext could ultimately be divided.\u201d15 This observation, although initially relating to\nthe field of alchemy, can also be applied to recipe books in general during the\nMiddle Ages and the premodern period. Robert Halleux underlined the similarity in\nformat between the mediaeval treatises of alchemy and the so-called technical\nrecipe books. He states that, whatever subject the recipe books are dedicated to,\nthey all present a similar structure, from the earliest Mesopotamian examples to the\npharmacopoeia texts of the sixteenth century. We could refine this definition by\nadding that the recipe is the smallest \u2018independent\u2019 element into which these texts\ncould be divided. In fact, a recipe could be seen as an independent text in itself and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=66\nPages: 66\n(collection(s) of) text(s). By displaying the various ways alchemical and artistic\nrecipes are embedded within the same manuscript, this study has highlighted the\npotential difficulties in localizing and distinguishing them.\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that recipe books partly derived\nfrom the recording and transmission of (more or less) contemporaneous practices.\nThus, recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of\nboth scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers\nor authorities. Recipe books also serve to define a more precise network in which\nthese types of knowledge circulated, delivering information about the \u2018actors\u2019\u2014\nwhether artisans, scholars, natural philosophers, (theoretical) alchemists or lay\nscribes\u2014and their interconnections, as well as the media (copy, oral source,\nexperiment) they used to exchange, share and communicate art and alchemy.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64\nPages: 64,63\nThe length of a recipe depends not only on the number of ingredients involved\nbut also on its complexity, the number of steps necessary to obtain the final product.\nA recipe can be anything from one sentence to several pages within a manuscript.\nAlternatively, a recipe may appear merely as a brief list of ingredients, without any\nother additional information. In fact, two categories of recipe can be distinguished:\nthe Vollrezepte (detailed recipes) and the Kurzrezepte (abbreviated recipes).55 In\nthe first, the quantities and the various steps are indicated. In the second, only the\n55\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 343.\n40\nS. Neven\ningredients are cited: the procedure is sketched out or omitted altogether and the\nrest is left to the ingenuity of the user. This second category is more common in the\ncase of artistic recipes; a great many of the recipes dedicated to the manufacture of\nink are written in the form of a very short list of ingredients. It is less common for]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=63\nPages: 63\nrecipes usually appear within a large broad of various (and unrelated) writings.\nFor example, part of Nuremberg Hs. 3227 (fol. 74v\u201381v, 90v\u2013164v) is a miscellanea\nof cooking, alchemical, household and artistic recipes, written by the same hand.\nHeidelberg Cod. Pal. Germ 678 notably includes a collection of medical recipes\ninterrupted by one single alchemical recipe, dedicated to the manufacture of vermilion.\nIn Berlin Theol. Lat. Quart. 152, some isolated alchemical recipes are placed in the\nmiddle of several cooking recipes and within religious texts.\nFinally, some recipes were never granted their own place within a collection of\nrecipes. An isolated recipe is sometimes jotted down on any available space on a\npage or squeezed into an even less appropriate place. For example, in Nuremberg\nMs. 27773, recipes dedicated to the colouring of glass and the hardening of steel\nappear under the form of later additions in the upper and lower margin of a school]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=63\nPages: 63\nappear under the form of later additions in the upper and lower margin of a school\nbook, and probably also on the binding board.\nThus reading these collections and attempting to categorise the recipes as\nalchemical or art-technological can be less than straightforward. After examining\nthe corpus in question the following suggestions are proposed to help identify the\ndifferent recipes.\nAs stated above, whether alchemical or art-technological, the recipes contained\nin these manuscripts are presented in the form of a formula which, in most cases,\nenumerates the ingredients and the actions necessary to produce a particular\npreparation.

They also include magical\nrecipes, dietetical instructions or advice on home-economics. All these various\ndisciplines are embedded within the genre of the Fachliteratur.13 This kind of\nliterature regroups all texts of a utilitarian and informative nature whose content\ndoes not principally concern aesthetic or religious issues, or matters relating to\nemotional purpose.14 A great number of these writings share the same format and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=59\nPages: 59,60\ncontemporary workshop or laboratory practices.48\nFirst of all, the textual environment and the diversity of the subjects bound\ntogether with the artistic and alchemical recipes in a same book, lead to the\nconclusion that these compilations were mainly read by scholars primarily interested in natural philosophy and were not intended for contemporary practical use.\nMoreover, it has been frequently stated that craft practices were transmitted orally,\n48\nClarke, \u201cCodicological Indicators\u201d; and Neven, Recettes artistiques, 16\u201323.\n36\nS.

These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=61\nPages: 61\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts. Frequently, the copyist was free to add,\nto remove or to omit some words or even some parts of the text. These modifications or omissions sometimes concern primary data, such as the name of the\ningredients or materials, or may be related to some of the steps of the procedure.\nAt each stage of the copying process, variations or errors can occur. This phenomenon can be explained in several ways: it could be an attempt to improve or to\ndiversify a previous formula; it could be a quid pro quo, in which an unknown or\nexpensive ingredient is substituted with a more well known or less expensive one; it\nmay have been a voluntary reduction of the recipe text.\nIf we suppose that the function of a recipe book was practical or instructive, this\nfunction could be the motivation behind changes to the recipes. An author or a scribe\nmay, voluntarily, have corrected the text, or added information to it.

At this stage, two\ndifferent hypotheses have been put forward regarding the aim of this type of\nliterature. On the one hand, these texts have been seen as manuals that may have\nbeen used by practitioners. On the other hand, the recipes often seem to have been\ntransmitted for the purposes of literary preservation, not directly connected with\ncontemporary workshop or laboratory practices.48]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=58\nPages: 58\nContextualising the production and reception of these recipe books thus serves to\nhighlight a large range of individual\u2019s personal\u2019s interest in alchemical and artisanal, as well as other types of knowledge. In this regard, a number of the recipe\nbooks produced in a religious institution are documented as having been later kept\nin a religious context. For example, Berlin Staatsbibliothek Theol. Lat. Quart.\n152, written by \u201cFrater Nicolaus lector\u201d between 1408 and 1412, was owned by\n\u201cFrater Polonus lector principalis\u201d (Johannes Polonus), lector in the Thorn cloister\nduring the fifteenth century. These manuscripts were usually moved to libraries at\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, during the period of secularisation that\nfollowed the French Revolution. In parallel, several examples of our corpus are\ndocumented as being part of private collections and were probably executed for or\ncommissioned by a patron. This is notably the case for the Kodex Berleburg (Bad]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=58\nPages: 58\nto be found in Seidel\u2019s Kunstb\u20ac\nucher. For example, in Cgm 4117, fol. 1v, a recipe is\nstated as coming from a certain Thomas, caster in Munich, and transmitted via\nFreising to Seidel.45 This instruction was placed in an available blank space,\nsituated between the title of one of the book\u2019s sections and the table of contents\n(Fig. 1). It is credited to Seidel, but the handwriting is slightly different from the rest\nof the manuscript text. These observations suggest that this recipe, coming from a\ncontemporary\u2014perhaps oral\u2014source is an isolated and later addition. Moreover,\nscribes sometimes even relate how contemporaneous authorities delivered their\n\u2018secret(s)\u2019 and even divulge the price they had to pay to obtain it. In other cases,\nrecipes are recorded as being offered as a gift pro memoria.46\nContextualising the production and reception of these recipe books thus serves to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59\nConclusion\nExamination of the processes of making, compiling and disseminating this corpus\nof mediaeval and premodern recipe books provides us with information concerning\ntheir nature and former function. One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person.

Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60,61\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates\nanother method for the same technical procedure, giving as title \u201cHow one should\nmasterfully melt crystal.\u201d52\nIn this sense, the scribes at the root of these recipe books created not simply a\ncopy but a unique work, which reflected their own interests, their cultural and life\ncontext and sometimes their intention, which was to deliver practical and useful\ninstruction.\n49\nHalleux, Entre technologie et alchimie, 7.\nFor this definition of authorship, see notably Love, Attributing Authorship, 32\u201340.\n51\n\u201cDise kunst prauchet ich nit hinden amm 219 hastu vil pessere.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, fol. 53r)\n52\n\u201cWie man christallen maisterlich giessen soll.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm\n4117, fol. 219)\n50\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n37\nReliability of Recipe Books]&quot;]}

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Recipe books from the medieval and early modern periods played a critical role in transmitting alchemical, artistic, and other forms of practical knowledge. Here are key themes related to their creation, use, and significance:

1. <strong>Composition and Compilation:</strong>
   Recipe books often evolved over time, with scribes compiling, copying, and adding to existing texts. These compilations might include alchemical recipes alongside those for art, medicine, cooking, and even magical practices. The process of copying these texts often introduced variations, interpolations, or errors, as scribes added their own interpretations or attempted to improve upon earlier formulas. For example, an ingredient might be substituted for a more readily available one, or steps in a procedure might be clarified or altered. These changes were sometimes voluntary attempts to refine the text for practical use [Laboratories of Art, page 61](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=61).

2. <strong>Scribes as Curators:</strong>
   Scribes were not mere passive copyists; they often acted as curators of the knowledge contained in these recipe books. They might organize, amend, or even correct the procedures they were recording, reflecting their own knowledge or the context in which the recipes were compiled. For example, Seidel’s recipes include instructions from contemporary artisans like Thomas the caster, illustrating how oral knowledge was recorded and transmitted within these texts [Laboratories of Art, page 60](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60).

3. <strong>Practical and Literary Purposes:</strong>
   Recipe books served both practical and scholarly purposes. While some were used directly in workshops or laboratories for practical instruction, others were intended to preserve knowledge for future generations or to serve as compendiums of theoretical information. For example, recipes for alchemical and artistic processes often appeared in manuscripts alongside medical or household instructions, blurring the lines between practical manuals and literary compilations [Laboratories of Art, pages 58-59](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=58).

4. <strong>Structure of Recipes:</strong>
   Recipes could range from simple lists of ingredients to detailed step-by-step instructions. They often followed a standardized structure, starting with a list of ingredients followed by actions to be performed. There were two main types: &quot;Vollrezepte&quot; (full recipes) with detailed procedures, and &quot;Kurzrezepte&quot; (abbreviated recipes) that only listed ingredients, leaving the process to the practitioner’s knowledge. The length and detail of the recipes varied greatly depending on the complexity of the final product [Laboratories of Art, pages 63-64](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=63).

5. <strong>Interdisciplinary Knowledge:</strong>
   The recipe books often reflected the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge at the time. They might contain instructions for creating pigments, preparing medicines, or performing metallurgical procedures, drawing from fields like alchemy, botany, and pharmacy. This mix of knowledge types highlights the interconnectedness of practical arts and scholarly disciplines during the period [Laboratories of Art, page 49](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=49).

Recipe books are therefore invaluable for understanding the transfer and evolution of practical knowledge in the medieval and early modern periods. Would you like to explore any specific recipes or further details from this section?</div>

In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures. By the seventeenth century, the expertise of some glassmakers,\nsilver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of\nalchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the\nlaboratory.24 Lawrence Principe and Morgan Wesley discuss two examples of\nsuch arts: silversmithing and porcelain production, respectively.\n21\nFor \u2018trading zones\u2019 between artisanal and scholarly cultures, see Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121\nPages: 121\ncraftsmen\u2019, introduced by Edgar Zilsel in 1942, who started to interact with\nacademics and humanists, is just one of the many important texts dealing with the\nexchange between the artes mechanicae and the artes liberales from the fifteenth\ncentury onwards, a theory which was recently elaborated and confirmed by Pamela\nH. Smith in The Body of the Artisan in 2004 and by Pamela O. Long in Artisan/\nPractitioners in 2011.45 Again in 2004, Davis Baird\u2019s contribution on \u2018thing\nknowledge\u2019 focussed on a \u2018philosophy of scientific instruments\u2019 and distinguishes\nwithin this epistemology of the artificial object three forms in which an instrument\ncan represent knowledge: firstly as model, secondly as product and medium of\nworking knowledge and thirdly as embodiment of \u2018encapsulated knowledge\u2019. His\ntheoretical system not only applied to scientific instruments, but can also be adapted\nto other artificially created objects, for instance to the Handsteine. In this field, it]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16,15\nFireworks, 28.\n20\nSmith, Body of the Artisan. esp. 95\u2013127.\nIntroduction\nxv\nsermons to reveal conceptions of the origin and formation of ores for which\nMathesius drew equally on natural philosophy and alchemy and on the artisanal\nknowledge of the local miners and goldsmiths.

They valued Handsteine for the\nmetallogenetic knowledge they embodied, thereby endorsing the shifting epistemic\nstatus of the arts.\nEpistemic Changes Between Artisans and Alchemists\nBiringuccio and Mathesius\u2019s St. Joachimsthal are examples of persons and places\nof exchange between scholarly cultures (in which learning is based on reading and\nwriting) and artisanal cultures (in which learning is based on doing).21 The laboratories created in Medici Florence, discussed in the chapters by Kieffer and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally. On the other\nhand, the basic materials of their artisanal labors\u2014gold and silver\u2014held a central\n5\nSee Smith, Body of the Artisan.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry. While not erased, the\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=75\nPages: 75,76\nWilliam R.

But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform.

As they were\ncopied in a context outside the workshop or the laboratory, these recipes were not\nrevised and, consequently, conveyed an anachronistic technical tradition that\nbecame more and more outdated.\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17\nPages: 17\nchemistry and skilled in porcelain production. Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds.

But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=125\nPages: 125,126\nBetween Maker and Nature.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Artisanal knowledge in scholarly contexts was a central theme in early modern laboratories and workshops, where artisans and scholars collaborated closely. These hybrid environments fostered the exchange of practical skills and theoretical knowledge, particularly in fields like metallurgy, glassmaking, and porcelain production. Here are some key points:

1. <strong>Artisan-Scholar Hybrids:</strong>
   Certain crafts, especially those involved in glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production, were particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly alchemical cultures. By the 17th century, artisans in these fields were just as familiar with scholarly, bookish learning as they were with hands-on laboratory work. These artisans could not be easily classified as either scholars or craftsmen—they were hybrid figures bridging both worlds. [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16)

2. <strong>Encapsulated Knowledge in Objects:</strong>
   Artisanal knowledge was often embedded in the objects created by these craftsmen. For instance, objects like the &quot;Handstein&quot; created by goldsmiths carried with them not only material value but also encapsulated knowledge of natural philosophy, theology, and alchemy. These objects visualized the interconnectedness of different forms of knowledge, blending artisanal practice with scholarly thought. [Laboratories of Art, page 122](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122)

3. <strong>Artisanal and Scholarly Collaborations:</strong>
   Gold- and silversmiths, in particular, collaborated with alchemists due to their involvement in refining metals. These tradesmen&#x27;s workshops were often equipped with the same apparatus used in alchemy—such as furnaces and crucibles—allowing for the exchange of chymical processes between scholars and artisans. For example, Anthoni Grill, a notable silversmith, successfully combined his business with alchemical transmutations. [Laboratories of Art, page 180](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180)

4. <strong>Laboratories as Shared Spaces:</strong>
   Renaissance courts and other elite settings often served as spaces where art technologies and alchemy were brought together. These laboratories, shared between artisans and scholars, were often indistinguishable from artisanal workshops in terms of the tools and instruments they contained. The rise of these hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of such laboratories. [Laboratories of Art, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17)

These insights reveal how artisans not only produced material objects but also contributed to scholarly knowledge, blurring the lines between the practical and theoretical realms.

<div class="msg tool"><div class="role tool">Tool</div>{&quot;result&quot;:[&quot;[Summary from page 51 to page 73 out of a total of 220:\nPages 51:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n27\nCraft practices, alchemical treatises and artists\u2019 recipe books thus share parts of\nthe same specific syntax, the frequent use of the imperative form but also some\nparticular verbs (such as \u2018grind\u2019, \u2018mix\u2019, \u2018purify\u2019) and vocabulary. For example, the\nfirst alchemists used the word tinctura to refer to the tinting or the dyeing of metals,\nstones or clothes.17 These methods notably explained how to dye metals yellow or\nwhite\u2014so (apparently) how to transmute them into gold or silver. They also\ndescribed various ways to counterfeit precious stones.18 In this context, the term\ntinctura does not relate to the artisanal practice of dyeing, but instead describes the\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people? Previous research has demonstrated that investigating questions related to the authorship and the context of\nproduction behind these texts, as well as their compilation and dissemination,\nelucidates information about the former nature and the previous and current function of these writings.20 Answering these questions would: first, help to better\nestimate the relevance of these books when using them as a historical source for\nreconstructing part of mediaeval and premodern alchemical and artistic knowledge.\nAnd second, examining the various connections and similarities between these two\nfields, as described within recipe books, would serve to (re)situate them in their\nhistorical and cultural contexts.\nThe Sources and the Context of Production\nFirst of all, the wide diversity of subjects and fields embedded within the corpus begs\nthe question: were they written by several authors? A priori, palaeographical examination tends to confirm this: as with a large number of recipe books produced during\nmediaeval and premodern times, the manuscripts examined were written by several\n17\nPrincipe, Secrets of Alchemy, 17; and Clarke, Art of All Colours, 37.\nSee in this volume Matteo Martelli.\n19\nBucklow, \u201cParadigms and Pigment Recipes\u201d; and Principe, Secrets of Alchemy, 35\u20136.\n20\nNeven, Recettes artistiques.\n18\n\nPages 52:\n28\nS. Neven\nhands, and these hands are predominately anonymous. These works thus appear to\nbe the result of collaboration, or at least intervention, by several distinct persons.\nHowever, each person\u2019s contribution cannot necessarily be allocated according to\nthe different subjects in the book. The same hand might be responsible for both a\nmedical treatise and a collection of alchemical or art technological recipes.\nThe manuscripts under consideration were, in fact, the result of copying and\ncompiling of various sources and contributors. More precisely, these recipe books\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources. This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities. Within our corpus several\nalchemical treatises and recipes are attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus\n(c.1190\u20131280), Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c.1240\u20131311) or Roger Bacon (1214\u2013\n1294). Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various\ntitles and were sometimes attributed to diverse authorities.23\nAt this stage, it should be noted that there are also a significant number of texts\ndedicated to religious content bound together with the recipe books under scrutiny.\nThese are theological works, liturgies, extracts from the bible and hagiographies.\nIn fact, a great number of recipe books appear to have been written or compiled within\n21\nMinnis, Theory of Authorship. Concerning the alchemical works attributed to Albertus Magnus\nsee notably Kibre, \u201cAlchemical Writings.\u201d See also Newman, \u201cAlchemy of Roger Bacon.\u201d For\nArnaldus de Villa Nova, see notably Calvet, \u201cTradition alchimique latine.\u201d\n22\nMinnis, Theory of Authorship, 9.\n23\nCalvet, \u201cTradition alchimique latine,\u201d 42.\n\nPages 53:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n29\nreligious institutions, as attested by the citations of ownership. Signatures or monograms within these compilations indicate that these books were copied by scribes and\nmembers of this community. Obviously, the religious institutions\u2014and their libraries\u2014were privileged places, offering scribes the opportunity to copy and compile this\nkind of collection. The Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Cgm 821, Cgm 822 and\nClm 20174, formerly preserved in the Tegernsee monastery library, are good examples: they present not only similarities in terms of the different writings they contain\nbut also, thanks to palaeographical analysis undertaken in the present study, it has\nbeen confirmed that several parts of their respective texts were recorded by the same\nscribe. This would imply that these manuscripts were (at least partially) copied in the\nsame scriptorium, from similar written sources and by the same \u2018hand\u2019.\nReligious institutions may also appear as a contextual factor explaining the\nrapprochement of the various disciplines embedded within the manuscripts. Indeed,\nin general, medical and pharmaceutical recipes had an important place within\nreligious communities. In this regard, art\u2013technological recipes also found their\nplace and could be linked with the art of writing and illuminating involved in\nscriptorial activity. The tables of contents of recipe books can be quite edifying on\nthis point. For example, the table of contents in Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek\nClm 20174 informs us that the artistic instructions were intended for the use of the\nscribes and illuminators of the scriptorium (Et alia multa utilia per scriptoribus et\nilluministarum, Clm 20174, fol. 1). In this context, scribe and illuminator, when not\nrepresented by the same person, worked side by side to produce manuscripts.24 This\ncollaboration led to enhanced communication and the development of a mutual\ninterest in artistic practices among the monastic community.25\nPractical or concrete interest and use of alchemical recipes in religious institutions is less obvious. It has been stated that writers of religious literature sometimes\ndrew parallels with alchemical theories and processes.26 Such writings, which\nobviously borrow alchemical vocabulary and imagery, are not included within our\ncorpus. None of the alchemical texts under scrutiny were found to contain obvious\nreligious connotations. But religious scribes\u2019 personal interest in alchemical craft\nprocedures and practical alchemy in general can be attested by the large number of\nmanuscripts produced that comprise both alchemical treatises and recipes. The\npresence of such instructions is more probably related to a certain attraction of\nalchemy for some monks or friars. Previous studies indeed have established that,\neven if the practice of alchemy was forbidden by several monastic orders, many of\ntheir members were at the root of alchemical (compilations of) texts and Practica.27\nInventories of their library also inform us that they possessed alchemical treatises\n24\nCe\u0301zard, \u201cAlchimie et les recettes techniques,\u201d 6.\nEamon, Secrets of Nature, 36.\n26\nPrincipe &amp; Newman, \u201cHistoriography of Alchemy,\u201d 398\u2013400.\n27\nTheisen, \u201cAttraction of Alchemy.\u201d See also Barthe\u0301lemy, Alchimie de Guillaume Sedacer, 26\u20138.\n25\n\nPages 54:\n30\nS. Neven\nand recipe books.28 Within our corpus, a relevant example is that of Wolfgang Seidel\n(1491\u20131562), prior but also copyist at Tegernsee monastery, who notably wrote two\nKunstb\u20ac\nucher (Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117 and Cgm 4118)\nbetween 1540 and 1550.29 Cgm 4117 and 4118 reflect Seidel\u2019s interests in mathematics, astronomy, natural sciences and alchemy\u2014disciplines in which he acquired\ntheoretical but also practical knowledge. To do so, Seidel is known to have notably\ncollected data from the libraries of Tegernsee but also from the neighbouring\ncloisters. During his stay at St. Ulrich\u2019s and St. Afra\u2019s Abbey (Augsburg), he\nmade use of the abbey\u2019s vast collection of books, as attested in his commentaries\nrecorded in Cgm 4118: \u201cSo many presents I have let copy from the library of the\nCloister St Ulrich in Augsbourg, by a young boy whose name is Walthasar Gech von\nFiessen in the year 1550.\u201d30\nSeidel also seems to have relied on exchanges that are known to have taken place\nwith contemporaries. In fact, in his Kunstb\u20ac\nucher, he cites the authorities from\nwhom he obtained practical information. These were either practitioners\u2014artists\u2014or contemporary scholars. For example, Seidel specifies several times that\nhe is indebted to Bishop Philipp von Freising (1480\u20131541) for some recipes that he\nsubsequently included in Cgm 4117. These prescriptions are notably dedicated to\nthe melting of gold, silver and lead (Cgm 4117, fol. 2v, 37r\u201338v). Seidel also\nmentions Bartholome Schobinger (1500\u20131585), a jurist from St. Gallen.31 The\ninstructions recorded after Schobinger\u2019s name delineated a number of alchemical\nmethods that notably serve to modify the properties of gold, to obtain a golden\ncolour, and to work with gold, silver, iron and copper. Others concern the gilding on\nglass, the melting of ivory, metals and glass, the preparation of aqua fortis and the\nmanufacture of a blue pigment called azure (Cgm 4117, fol. 62r\u2013130r?).\nThese persons were learned persons or scholars, who were interested in natural\nphilosophy and alchemy and who perhaps conducted their own experiments, as\nsuggested by formulae which follow some of the recipes, such as probatum vom\nBischoff von Freising (Cgm 4117, fol. 2v). Schobinger is notably at the root of a\nlarge compilation of alchemical texts.32 He is also renewed for having personally\nknown Paracelsus, who referred to Schobinger\u2019s writings.33 The value of such an\nauthority may appear visually in the recipe book. In the Cgm 4117, Seidel dedicates\na whole page to recording Schobinger\u2019s name.34 Moreover, the simple invocation\n28\nSee, for example, Barthe\u0301lemy, \u201cAlchimie et me\u0301decine,\u201d 110\u20133.\nPaulus, \u201cWolfgang Seidel\u201d; and Po\u0308hlein, Wolfgang Seidel.\n30\n\u201cSo vill vom geschenckh hab ich auss der liberej des closters zw sant vlrich zw Augspurg lassen\nabschreiben durch ain knaben des namen ist Walthasar Gech von Fiessen im 1550 Jahr.\u201d (Munich,\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4118, fol. 128r).\n31\nSchobinger, Schowinger von St. Gallen.\n32\nAllgemeine Deutsche Biographie, 209; and Hertenstein, Joachim von Watt, 91\u20132.\n33\nMeier, Paracelsus, 33\u201346.\n34\n\u201cVon bartholome Schobinger burger zu sanndt Gallen in Schweitz.

Thus, the same way the scribes used to relate old\ntreatises or data with the name of previous and quoted authorities, such as (pseudo)\nAlbertus Magnus or Arnaldus de Villa Nova, they also mention those of their\ncontemporaries to lend authority to validate the practicability or the reproducibility\nof the instructions they consign.35\nIn some cases, the information recorded in recipe books is documented as having\nbeen provided by an artist or practitioner. Augsbourg Staats- und Stadtbibliothek 2\u0001\nCod. 207 was produced in St. Ulrich and St. Afra\u2019s Cloister. It contains miscellaneous alchemical treatises and collections of recipes contributed by several scribes,\nincluding the monk Bild Vitus (1481\u20131529) and Johannes Gossolt (1421\u20131506),\nidentified as vicarius augustensis.36 In this work, Gossolt combined alchemical\ntreatises attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus with Latin and German alchemical\nrecipes. For the latter he sometimes specifies his local sources. For example, at folio\n171v, he mentions the \u201cMagistri Jodoci Aurifabri de Haidelberga.\u201d Other citations\nof goldsmiths\u2019 names are found in our corpus of texts. In the St. Gallen Cod.\nVadiana 395, several alchemical instructions are associated with the name of\n\u201cNicolaus Aurifaber.\u201d In many respects, metalworkers seem to have shared interest\nand knowledge in alchemical practices and materials.37\nThe scribes did not indicate how these data were actually provided and disseminated. At this stage, it is difficult to determine if these recipes were transmitted\norally or only in written form. Oral transmission is usually favoured in specific\ncontexts and environments in which people \u2018physically\u2019 converse.38 In this regard,\nthe workshop or laboratory probably offered the required closeness and the opportunity for oral exchanges and teaching. In the framework of this study, in only a few\ncases has it been possible to establish that a scribe personally met the authority he\ncited, meaning he might have obtained orally the practical information he recorded\nwithin his recipe book. This is notably the case for Seidel and two of the persons he\ncites, von Freising and Schobinger.39 Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that oral data\ncirculated under the rhetoric of the recipe. This standardized and conventional\ntextual format goes hand in hand with the copying process, and, thus, with a written\ntransmission of knowledge. In other cases, exchanges in the form of correspondence are documented. For example, Seidel is also known to have exchanged letters\nwith the monk Vitus, previously quoted, and (partially) responsible for Augsbourg\nStaats- und Stadtbibliothek 2\u0001 Cod. 207.40 Both shared the same interest in natural\nphilosophy, astronomy and alchemy\u2014the same fields addressed within their\nwritings.\n35\nSee notably Halleux, \u201cPratique de laboratoire.\u201d\nThis hand is identified within the Augsbourg, Staats\u2013 und Stadtbibliothek, 2\u0001 Cod. 183, fol. 1r.\n37\nSmith, Body of the Artisan, 140\u201351.\n38\nFox &amp; Woolf, Spoken Word, 259\u201361.\n39\nPfaff, Codex Vadiana, 43.\n40\nNeue Deutsche Biographie, vol. II, 235.\n36\n\nPages 56:\n32\nS. Neven\nFinally, some recipes recorded within the corpus are a scribe\u2019s personal contribution. The acquisition of theoretical but also practical knowledge in natural\nscience and alchemy may have lead Seidel to conduct his own experiments,\nwhich he then recorded in the form of recipes in his books. This possibility is\nconfirmed in the first folio of Cgm 4118, where Seidel explains that he as well as\nboth written (and older) sources and information collected from contemporaries, he\nhad also drawn on his own practical experience.41 The St. Gallen Ms. Vadiana\n429 is an alchemical collection compiled between 1464/65 by Ulrich Ellenbog\n(1435\u20131499), a city physician in Ravensburg. A small part of its content also\nincludes art technological recipes. Ellenbog\u2019s interest and practical knowledge in\n(al)chemy could notably be put in relation with his 1473 pamphlet Von den giftigen\nbesen Temppfen Reuchen der Metal (On the poisonous and noxious vapours and\nfumes of metals). In this writing, the physician gives advices to goldsmiths and\nother metalworkers on how to protect themselves from the noxious effects of\nvapours of silver, mercury and lead.42\nThe Modalities of Composition\nThe diversity of sources and persons who contributed to these collections of recipes\nis evidenced by their varying modalities of composition. Codicological examination\nundertaken during this study has uncovered the (sometimes) very complex processes involved in the creation of recipe books.\nA small number of these writings are produced in the form of carefully presented\nand independent collections: they are written in metallogallic ink and are quite\noften embellished with titles in red, and rubrics. These examples may be relatively\nhomogeneous: usually, only one or two scribes (who are contemporaneous) can be\nidentified and the presentation of their texts is almost identical. Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting). They are informally\nwritten, with no decoration, and are characterized by apparently random presentation\nand inconsistent structure.\nThe recipe titles, which do not always correspond to the procedure that follows\nthem, do not imply a coherent organization. This second type of manuscript was\ncompiled from several contributions and additions from various scribes and\n41\n\u201cDe arte fusoria Rhapsodia partim ex uetusta quadam Biblioteca, partim uero bonorum\namicorum colatione cum sumata, opera autem et labore fratris Wolffgangi Sedelij in vnum collecta\nin solacium et commodum fusorie artis studiosorum.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm\n4118, fol. 1r).\n42\nTeleky, History of Factory, 7; and Koelsch, Geschichte des Arbeitsmedezin, 101.\n\nPages 57:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n33\ncompilers, but also from the accumulation of physically distinct materials\u2014quires\nand folios. Moreover, the diverse sections that make up these books often come\nfrom different geographical locations.\nFrequently, additions and marginal notes attributed to the same scribe or to a\nlater owner punctuate the distinct recipes within the manuscripts. In fact, these\nadditions mostly appear under the form of titles or details given as a counterpart to\nthe instructions. In the Ms. Vadiana 429 from St. Gallen, a great number of\nadditional notes consist of technical commentaries and supplementary notes\nadded to those of the compiler of the manuscript. In the Nuremberg Hs. 33733, a\nlater owner added several titles and remarks within the margins. Some of these\nmarginal additions also mention the name of the person from whom the scribe may\nhave obtained the data he is adding. For example, in the Vienna Ms. 5224, fol.\n74, the scribe indicated the name of a physician, \u201cDoctor Jorg erffordie,\u201d before the\ntitle of a recipe dedicated to the production of sal ammoniac. On folio 105 of the\nsame manuscript, the scribe associated an alchemical procedure with the name\n\u201cMarggrauff von Ro\u0308tell\u201d by mentioning him in the upper margin. This observation\nprovides a possible explanation for the considerable number of unica (isolated\nrecipes) that appear only in one recipe book, and are thus likely to constitute data\ntransmitted personally (and orally?) to the scribe.\nThe method of composition in this kind of recipe book indicates that they were\ncompiled over a more or less long period, during or after peregrinations undertaken\nby their scribes. This is evidenced by notations mentioning different chronological\nperiods and geographical provenances throughout the manuscripts. For example,\nMs. 9715 from Nuremberg contains diverse collections of alchemical recipes. This\nmanuscript was written by several scribes, who give names of persons or magistri\nunderneath the practices they described. They also cite the different places where\nthey collected their data and specify the dates of these events, which span several\nyears. Notably there are several mentions of the \u201cmagistri Johannis Bog\u201d and places\nsuch as \u201cErffordie\u201d (Erfurt), and \u201cKo\u0308ln\u201d (Cologne).43\nMoreover, later additions or annotations found within the manuscripts tend to\nsuggest that these books have been handled, manipulated and passed from one\nowner to another, sometimes over a long period. The Prager Malerbuch had several\nowners and circulated through several localities before entering the monastery of\nZlata\u0301 Koruna. According to a note written by Federl Mir, the main scribe of the\nPrager Malerbuch, this manuscript was written c.1452, in Tittmoning in the district\nof Traunstein (Bavaria). This place probably corresponds to the original provenance\nof the recipe book. Moreover, the scribe tells us that he has gathered data from\nMichel Schril, a professor in Vienna, who passed away in 1472. We also know that\nfrom 1529 to at least 1599, this recipe book belonged to the Preisinger family. This\nfamily lived in Zettwing, in the present-day Czech Republic, between Munich and\n43\nOn Johannis Bog, see fol. 42v, 72v, 157v; on Erfurt, see fol. 49r; and on Cologne, see fol. 50v.\n\nPages 58:\n34\nS. Neven\nVienna. Later, the manuscript is recorded within the inventory of the Zlata\u0301 Koruna\nconvent, as indicated in folio 1r, where we find the date 1649.\nThus, the recording and disseminating of these instructions could go hand in\nhand with the circulation and penetration of alchemical and artistic knowledge\noutside the workshop or the laboratory.44 It could be linked with a (partially oral?)\ntransmission of knowledge that seems to have taken place between (learned)\nscribes, artists or artisans and scholars. Allusions to such exchanges are notably\nto be found in Seidel\u2019s Kunstb\u20ac\nucher. For example, in Cgm 4117, fol. 1v, a recipe is\nstated as coming from a certain Thomas, caster in Munich, and transmitted via\nFreising to Seidel.45 This instruction was placed in an available blank space,\nsituated between the title of one of the book\u2019s sections and the table of contents\n(Fig. 1). It is credited to Seidel, but the handwriting is slightly different from the rest\nof the manuscript text. These observations suggest that this recipe, coming from a\ncontemporary\u2014perhaps oral\u2014source is an isolated and later addition. Moreover,\nscribes sometimes even relate how contemporaneous authorities delivered their\n\u2018secret(s)\u2019 and even divulge the price they had to pay to obtain it. In other cases,\nrecipes are recorded as being offered as a gift pro memoria.46\nContextualising the production and reception of these recipe books thus serves to\nhighlight a large range of individual\u2019s personal\u2019s interest in alchemical and artisanal, as well as other types of knowledge. In this regard, a number of the recipe\nbooks produced in a religious institution are documented as having been later kept\nin a religious context. For example, Berlin Staatsbibliothek Theol. Lat. Quart.\n152, written by \u201cFrater Nicolaus lector\u201d between 1408 and 1412, was owned by\n\u201cFrater Polonus lector principalis\u201d (Johannes Polonus), lector in the Thorn cloister\nduring the fifteenth century. These manuscripts were usually moved to libraries at\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, during the period of secularisation that\nfollowed the French Revolution. In parallel, several examples of our corpus are\ndocumented as being part of private collections and were probably executed for or\ncommissioned by a patron. This is notably the case for the Kodex Berleburg (Bad\nBerleburg, Schlossbibliothek Sayn\u2013Wittgenstein, RT 2/6) which is recorded as\nbeing compiled for Bernhard of Breidenbach (c.1440\u20131497), who worked for the\nchapter of the cathedral of Mayence. Cod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel is a\ncollection of alchemical treatises and instructions\u2014including colour recipes\u2014\nwritten around 1441\u20131444 by several hands. A note on the binding informs us\nthat this volume probably belonged to the Bavarian physician Johannes Hartlieb\n(1410\u20131468), who wrote several compendia notably the Puch aller verpoten kunst,\nungelaubens und der zaubrey (1456).47\n44\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 342.\n\u201cVom Jungen thoman giesser zw munchen durch den bischoff von freising.\u201d (Munich,\nBayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, fol. 1v).\n46\nSee Corbett, \u201cAlchimiste Le\u0301onard de Mauperg.\u201d\n47\n\u201cSum magistri Iohannis Hartliep, alias Walsporn, Vangionensis\u201d; on Hartlieb, see Fu\u0308rbeth,\nJohannes Hartlieb; for the edition of the text, see Eisermann &amp; Graf, Johannes Hartlieb.\n45\n\nPages 59:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n35\nFig. 1 Additional instruction due to Seidel, Munchen, Cgm 4117, fol. 1rv (Courtesy of\nMu\u0308nchener Digitalierungszentrum)\nThe Function(s) of Recipe Books\nThe complex modalities of composition and diffusion of these texts raises some\nquestions regarding their nature and their original function. At this stage, two\ndifferent hypotheses have been put forward regarding the aim of this type of\nliterature. On the one hand, these texts have been seen as manuals that may have\nbeen used by practitioners. On the other hand, the recipes often seem to have been\ntransmitted for the purposes of literary preservation, not directly connected with\ncontemporary workshop or laboratory practices.48\nFirst of all, the textual environment and the diversity of the subjects bound\ntogether with the artistic and alchemical recipes in a same book, lead to the\nconclusion that these compilations were mainly read by scholars primarily interested in natural philosophy and were not intended for contemporary practical use.\nMoreover, it has been frequently stated that craft practices were transmitted orally,\n48\nClarke, \u201cCodicological Indicators\u201d; and Neven, Recettes artistiques, 16\u201323.\n\nPages 60:\n36\nS. Neven\nfrom the master to the apprentice.49 A large number of the manuscripts of this study\nresult from copying and compilation processes undertaken by scribes. As they were\ncopied in a context outside the workshop or the laboratory, these recipes were not\nrevised and, consequently, conveyed an anachronistic technical tradition that\nbecame more and more outdated.\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities\nlinked to \u2018authorship\u2019.50 Scribes also made attempts to ensure that the recipes could\nbe consulted at need: they composed tables of contents or indexes, they introduced\ntitles within the margins and many other details which attest to a real desire to\ndeliver usable information. In this context the marginal notes and additions made by\nthe scribes/authors of the recipe book are of interest as most of them are technical\ncomments testifying practical interest in both alchemical and artistic instructions.\nSeveral marginal annotations due to Seidel\u2019s hand punctuate the Cgm 4117 and\nconsist in personal commentaries regarding the technical procedures he records.\nFor example, on folio 53r, Seidel compares two ways for the melting of crystal.\nConcerning the first process he states in the margin that this \u2018art\u2019 was not of use to\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates\nanother method for the same technical procedure, giving as title \u201cHow one should\nmasterfully melt crystal.\u201d52\nIn this sense, the scribes at the root of these recipe books created not simply a\ncopy but a unique work, which reflected their own interests, their cultural and life\ncontext and sometimes their intention, which was to deliver practical and useful\ninstruction.\n49\nHalleux, Entre technologie et alchimie, 7.\nFor this definition of authorship, see notably Love, Attributing Authorship, 32\u201340.\n51\n\u201cDise kunst prauchet ich nit hinden amm 219 hastu vil pessere.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm 4117, fol. 53r)\n52\n\u201cWie man christallen maisterlich giessen soll.\u201d (Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cgm\n4117, fol. 219)\n50\n\nPages 61:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n37\nReliability of Recipe Books\nThe modalities of composition and diffusion of these recipe books have an impact\non their current (practical) use. During the compiling and disseminating processes,\nboth alchemical and art-technological collections of recipes were subject to mutations, in the form of interpolation, reduction, contamination or assimilation with\nother texts. As the recipe books evolved and were modified by adding new texts and\nprocedures, the recipes themselves could be modified in their technical formulations during their transmission from one manuscript to another. Assimilation with\nother texts occurs quite frequently, as the ingredients (and the actions) specified in\nthese texts appear in the artistic recipe books but also in medical treatises, cookery\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts. Frequently, the copyist was free to add,\nto remove or to omit some words or even some parts of the text. These modifications or omissions sometimes concern primary data, such as the name of the\ningredients or materials, or may be related to some of the steps of the procedure.\nAt each stage of the copying process, variations or errors can occur. This phenomenon can be explained in several ways: it could be an attempt to improve or to\ndiversify a previous formula; it could be a quid pro quo, in which an unknown or\nexpensive ingredient is substituted with a more well known or less expensive one; it\nmay have been a voluntary reduction of the recipe text.\nIf we suppose that the function of a recipe book was practical or instructive, this\nfunction could be the motivation behind changes to the recipes. An author or a scribe\nmay, voluntarily, have corrected the text, or added information to it. However,\nchanges to the recipe may also be due to a misunderstanding of the procedure.\nSuch miscomprehension may be due to palaeographical problems that resulted in a\nword being misread or misunderstood and thus replaced by another. This was a\nlikely occurrence if the copyist was not a practitioner or if he was not able to\ntranslate or to decipher an unreadable formula. For example, in Heidelberg Cod. Pal.\nGerm. 183, fol. 286, at the beginning of a recipe dedicated to the production of\nminium, the scribe mentions the use of \u201cLautterm sapienticum\u201d instead of Lutum\nsapientium. In Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Cgm 824, the scribe describes\nthe preparation of a white (fol. 13r), a yellow (fol. 13r), a blue (fol. 14v) and a grey\npigment (fol. 14v), and each time suggests taking \u201ccretam rosam.\u201d53 The same\ninstructions are recorded in the Cgm 822 (fol. 64v) where the scribe correctly\nindicates the use of cretam rasam (scraped chalk).\nSuch phenomena\u2014reduction, amplification, variation\u2014may result in a procedure whose description can seem vague or unclear and thus thwart the current use\nand relevance of recipe books in the study and the reconstruction of historical\nartistic practices.\n53\nMy italics.\n\nPages 62:\n38\nS. Neven\nAlchemical and Art-Technological Recipes Within\na Manuscript: Location, Relationship and Distinction\nSimilarities of format and modalities of composition and diffusion may have had an\nimpact on the recording and assembling of alchemical and art-technological recipes\nwithin the same manuscript. This could notably result in the mixing and grouping of\ndifferent types of unrelated instructions.\nMore precisely, in the corpus under scrutiny, alchemical instructions appear\neither as independent pieces of work, or as isolated (groups of) recipe(s) embedded\nwith artistic or other types of instructions. In the first case, alchemical content may\nappear concurrently with an artist\u2019s recipe book within the same manuscript but in a\nseparate section. When this occurs, the texts mostly consist of quite theoretical\nalchemical treatises, often associated with the name of a former or contemporary\nauthority. Most of them are attributed to the (pseudo) Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon\nand Arnaldus de Villa Nova whose writings date from an earlier period. These works\ncould also be \u2018physically\u2019 distinct works, delimited to a quire or a booklet\u2014or even a\nfolio\u2014and assembled with the rest of the manuscript at a contemporary or later\nperiod. Vienna Ms. 5224 contains various alchemical collections of recipes and\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios. These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.\nAlchemical texts are also sometimes situated alongside an artists\u2019 recipe book,\neither before or after. If this is the case, they will be found next to technical\ninstructions dedicated to procedures similar to those described in an alchemical\ncontext, such as the imitation of gold or silver, the gilding of stones or glass, the\nmanufacture of vermilion, the purification of ultramarine, the melting of stones or\nmetals, or several dyeing procedures. The alchemical content may be delimited\nwithin the title(s), chapter(s) or table of contents or \u2018physically\u2019 circumscribed by a\nfolio or a quire. But, in most cases, there is no obvious delimitation between the two\ndistinct collections of recipes. For example, in Nuremberg Germanisches\n54\nIdentified as \u2018hand\u2019 4 in the catalogue notes, he is responsible for fol. 31v, 38r\u2013120v, 123r\u2013143r,\n153r\u2013157v, 160r\u2013163r.\n\nPages 63:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n39\nNationalmuseum Ms. 5078b (fol. 2r\u201341r), the scribe moves from one subject to\nanother with no indication that the subject has changed. Moreover, this set of\nalchemical and art-technological recipes is followed with no clear distinction\n(no title, nor blank space) by a series of medical prescriptions due to the same hand.\nIn another case\u2014isolated (groups of) alchemical recipes found in the middle of\nprescriptions of another type\u2014detection of alchemical content and distinction from\nartistic instructions within recipe books can be fraught with difficulty. Similarities in\nterms of their textual format probably lead scribes to group them with other sort of\nprescriptions. When found as isolated elements, alchemical and art technological\nrecipes usually appear within a large broad of various (and unrelated) writings.\nFor example, part of Nuremberg Hs. 3227 (fol. 74v\u201381v, 90v\u2013164v) is a miscellanea\nof cooking, alchemical, household and artistic recipes, written by the same hand.\nHeidelberg Cod. Pal. Germ 678 notably includes a collection of medical recipes\ninterrupted by one single alchemical recipe, dedicated to the manufacture of vermilion.\nIn Berlin Theol. Lat. Quart. 152, some isolated alchemical recipes are placed in the\nmiddle of several cooking recipes and within religious texts.\nFinally, some recipes were never granted their own place within a collection of\nrecipes. An isolated recipe is sometimes jotted down on any available space on a\npage or squeezed into an even less appropriate place. For example, in Nuremberg\nMs. 27773, recipes dedicated to the colouring of glass and the hardening of steel\nappear under the form of later additions in the upper and lower margin of a school\nbook, and probably also on the binding board.\nThus reading these collections and attempting to categorise the recipes as\nalchemical or art-technological can be less than straightforward. After examining\nthe corpus in question the following suggestions are proposed to help identify the\ndifferent recipes.\nAs stated above, whether alchemical or art-technological, the recipes contained\nin these manuscripts are presented in the form of a formula which, in most cases,\nenumerates the ingredients and the actions necessary to produce a particular\npreparation. In addition artistic recipes sometimes indicate the recommended\ngeographical provenance or grade of quality of the ingredients. Suggestions for\npossible substitutions might also appear. This sort of information is rare in alchemical recipes.\nThe length of a recipe depends not only on the number of ingredients involved\nbut also on its complexity, the number of steps necessary to obtain the final product.\nA recipe can be anything from one sentence to several pages within a manuscript.\nAlternatively, a recipe may appear merely as a brief list of ingredients, without any\nother additional information. In fact, two categories of recipe can be distinguished:\nthe Vollrezepte (detailed recipes) and the Kurzrezepte (abbreviated recipes).55 In\nthe first, the quantities and the various steps are indicated. In the second, only the\n55\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 343.\n\nPages 64:\n40\nS. Neven\ningredients are cited: the procedure is sketched out or omitted altogether and the\nrest is left to the ingenuity of the user. This second category is more common in the\ncase of artistic recipes; a great many of the recipes dedicated to the manufacture of\nink are written in the form of a very short list of ingredients. It is less common for\nthe alchemical recipes to be presented this way.\nThe title of a recipe may also give an indication of the final product to be obtained\nand, in some cases, specify the use of the product. Again, this is particularly true for\nartistic instructions and is less observable for alchemical ones.\nFor both types of instructions (alchemical or artistic), some steps could be\nomitted or were left to the interpretation of the reader. Specified quantities may\nbe missing in both fields. When quantities are given, artistic recipes are far more\nlikely to use local measurements, whereas in alchemical instructions, the quantities\u2014if mentioned at all\u2014are more often expressed in terms of ratio or proportions.\nIn some cases, these proportions are not \u2018practically\u2019 correct. A very well-known\nexample is the proportion of mercury and sulphur proposed by mediaeval recipes\nfor the production of vermilion which is invariably incorrect.56 Very rarely are the\ncorrect chemical proportions cited.\nIn parallel, alchemical writings may involve the use of symbols or metaphors to\ndesignate substances and practices. In consequence, the way an alchemical recipe\nwas received would depend on the degree of experience of the reader-practitioner\nreading it. On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy. On the other hand, the omitted information may have\nbeen complemented by data only known to some readers and not recorded by the\ncopyist who conserves only the essential part of the recipe. If so then this kind of\nrecipe was only meant to be accessible and useable by those practitioners who could\neasily fill in the lacuna that punctuated the text of the recipe.\nAs previously observed, citations of authority were frequently used by the scribes\nof the manuscripts. However, the tendency for an older authority to be cited in the\nrecipe books is particularly characteristic of the alchemical writings and less typical\nof the art-technological recipes. As stated above, such citations primarily served to\nlegitimate the technical and chemical procedures. In addition, most alchemical\nrecipes describe processes and practical results to validate previously enounced\ntheoretical principles. Thus, more than artistic recipes, alchemical instructions\nemphasize the efficacy of the procedure which is frequently confirmed through\nexpressions such as expertum es or probatum est which are placed at the beginning\nor end of the instructions. The notion of experimenta (testing) implies the acquisition or confirmation of theoretical knowledge through direct observation and experimentation rather than through analysis based on rational arguments.57 In such a case,\nwhen one of these reassuring expressions appears at the end (or the beginning) of a\nrecipe, it does not signify that the recipe has actually been tested by the scribe.\n56\n57\nBucklow, \u201cParadigms and Pigment Recipes,\u201d 144.\nHalleux, \u201cPratique de laboratoire.\u201d\n\nPages 65:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n41\nRather it implies that the recipe constitutes a plausible set of instructions, and has\nbeen successfully performed at least once and/or confirmed by a previous authority.\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59\nConclusion\nExamination of the processes of making, compiling and disseminating this corpus\nof mediaeval and premodern recipe books provides us with information concerning\ntheir nature and former function. One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person. Both the context of their production and the similarities in\n58\nNewman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate,\u201d 434, 442\u20135. The author largely relies on Paul\nof Taranto, Theorica et practica, Paris, BN, Lat. 7159, fol. 1r\u201355r for which he delivers a partial\nedition and translation.\n59\nHalleux, \u201cPratique de laboratoire,\u201d 118\u201322.\n\nPages 66:\n42\nS.

These first\nobservations tend to suggest that these recipe books were produced for literary\npurposes and to preserve existing knowledge. And, indeed, these compilations were\nmainly read by a scholarly public primarily interested in natural philosophy,\nastrology, and alchemy and were probably not intended for practical use within\nthe workshop or the laboratory.\nMoreover, as these books are the result of compilation and additions of data, the\nfinding and the delimitation of alchemical content can be complicated, especially\nwhen isolated (groups of) recipe(s) were recorded in the middle of unrelated\n(collection(s) of) text(s). By displaying the various ways alchemical and artistic\nrecipes are embedded within the same manuscript, this study has highlighted the\npotential difficulties in localizing and distinguishing them.\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that recipe books partly derived\nfrom the recording and transmission of (more or less) contemporaneous practices.\nThus, recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of\nboth scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers\nor authorities. Recipe books also serve to define a more precise network in which\nthese types of knowledge circulated, delivering information about the \u2018actors\u2019\u2014\nwhether artisans, scholars, natural philosophers, (theoretical) alchemists or lay\nscribes\u2014and their interconnections, as well as the media (copy, oral source,\nexperiment) they used to exchange, share and communicate art and alchemy.\n\nPages 67:\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n43\nAppendix: List of Manuscripts\nAugsbourg, Staatsbibliothek\n\u2013 2\u0001 Cod 207, c.1514\nScribe:\nJohannes Gossolt and Bild Vitus (1481\u20131529), monk at St Ulrich in\nAugsburg\nLanguage: Latin and German\n\u2013 2\u0001 Cod 572, before 1446 (part 2)\u20131446 (part 1)\nLanguage: partly written in Swabian (part 1) and Bavarian (part 2) dialects\n\u2013 4\u0001 Cod 131, 15th\u201316th century (the recipes)\nLanguage: German\n\u2013 4\u0001 Cod 149, c.1501\u20131519\nScribe:\nLeonhard Wagner\nowner:\nLanguage: Schwabian\nOrigin:\nwritten in Augsbourg (St Ulrich and Afra), Irsee, St Gallen, Lorsch\nBad Berleburg, Schlossbibliothek Sayn-Wittgenstein\n\u2013 RT 2/6 Kodex Berleburg, c.1475\u20131478\nLanguage:\nFranconian and Latin\nOrigin:\nRhine Main\nPrevious\nBernhard of Breidenbach, (who worked for the chapter of the\nowner:\nCathedral of Mayence)\nBamberg, Staatsbibliothek\n\u2013 L III 33, 16th century\nLanguage: Middle German\n\nPages 68:\n44\nS.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized the document from pages 51 to 73. Here&#x27;s an overview:

### Transmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge
This section focuses on how alchemical and artistic knowledge was transmitted through recipe books, primarily in medieval Germany. It explores the shared linguistic structures of alchemical and artistic texts, highlighting how alchemists and artisans used similar processes and terminology, such as &quot;grind,&quot; &quot;mix,&quot; and &quot;purify.&quot; It also addresses how religious institutions played a significant role in the compilation and dissemination of these texts, with monks and scribes contributing to the preservation of this knowledge.

### Key Topics Covered:
- The common syntax and vocabulary used in alchemical and artistic recipes, often focusing on processes like dyeing metals and transmuting substances.
- The role of religious institutions in copying and compiling recipe books, where alchemical and artistic instructions were often recorded together.
- The contributions of notable figures such as Wolfgang Seidel and Bartholome Schobinger, who compiled and transmitted both theoretical and practical knowledge.
- The collaborative nature of these texts, with multiple scribes and contributors, leading to compilations of diverse content, including alchemical, medical, and artistic recipes.

### Choice Quotes:
- &quot;Both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions, and ingredients. So both used an identical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a &#x27;step-by-step&#x27; procedure.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51)
- &quot;The same hand might be responsible for both a medical treatise and a collection of alchemical or art technological recipes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 52](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52)

It is less common for\nthe alchemical recipes to be presented this way.\nThe title of a recipe may also give an indication of the final product to be obtained\nand, in some cases, specify the use of the product. Again, this is particularly true for\nartistic instructions and is less observable for alchemical ones.\nFor both types of instructions (alchemical or artistic), some steps could be\nomitted or were left to the interpretation of the reader. Specified quantities may\nbe missing in both fields. When quantities are given, artistic recipes are far more\nlikely to use local measurements, whereas in alchemical instructions, the quantities\u2014if mentioned at all\u2014are more often expressed in terms of ratio or proportions.\nIn some cases, these proportions are not \u2018practically\u2019 correct.

In consequence, the way an alchemical recipe\nwas received would depend on the degree of experience of the reader-practitioner\nreading it. On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy. On the other hand, the omitted information may have\nbeen complemented by data only known to some readers and not recorded by the\ncopyist who conserves only the essential part of the recipe.

In addition artistic recipes sometimes indicate the recommended\ngeographical provenance or grade of quality of the ingredients. Suggestions for\npossible substitutions might also appear. This sort of information is rare in alchemical recipes.\nThe length of a recipe depends not only on the number of ingredients involved]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=66\nPages: 66\n(collection(s) of) text(s).

Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62,63\n153r\u2013157v, 160r\u2013163r.\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n39\nNationalmuseum Ms. 5078b (fol. 2r\u201341r), the scribe moves from one subject to\nanother with no indication that the subject has changed.

It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people? Previous research has demonstrated that investigating questions related to the authorship and the context of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=49\nPages: 49,50\nvol.

They also include magical\nrecipes, dietetical instructions or advice on home-economics. All these various\ndisciplines are embedded within the genre of the Fachliteratur.13 This kind of\nliterature regroups all texts of a utilitarian and informative nature whose content\ndoes not principally concern aesthetic or religious issues, or matters relating to\nemotional purpose.14 A great number of these writings share the same format and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.\nAlchemical texts are also sometimes situated alongside an artists\u2019 recipe book,\neither before or after. If this is the case, they will be found next to technical\ninstructions dedicated to procedures similar to those described in an alchemical\ncontext, such as the imitation of gold or silver, the gilding of stones or glass, the\nmanufacture of vermilion, the purification of ultramarine, the melting of stones or\nmetals, or several dyeing procedures. The alchemical content may be delimited\nwithin the title(s), chapter(s) or table of contents or \u2018physically\u2019 circumscribed by a\nfolio or a quire. But, in most cases, there is no obvious delimitation between the two\ndistinct collections of recipes. For example, in Nuremberg Germanisches\n54\nIdentified as \u2018hand\u2019 4 in the catalogue notes, he is responsible for fol. 31v, 38r\u2013120v, 123r\u2013143r,\n153r\u2013157v, 160r\u2013163r.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\neither as independent pieces of work, or as isolated (groups of) recipe(s) embedded\nwith artistic or other types of instructions. In the first case, alchemical content may\nappear concurrently with an artist\u2019s recipe book within the same manuscript but in a\nseparate section. When this occurs, the texts mostly consist of quite theoretical\nalchemical treatises, often associated with the name of a former or contemporary\nauthority. Most of them are attributed to the (pseudo) Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon\nand Arnaldus de Villa Nova whose writings date from an earlier period. These works\ncould also be \u2018physically\u2019 distinct works, delimited to a quire or a booklet\u2014or even a\nfolio\u2014and assembled with the rest of the manuscript at a contemporary or later\nperiod. Vienna Ms. 5224 contains various alchemical collections of recipes and\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios.

More importantly, as Martelli remarks in his essay, the scope of\na recipe collection such as the Mappae clavicula, compiled between the ninth and\nthe twelfth centuries, is as encompassing as that of the Papyri despite the earlier\nattempts to limit alchemy to metallic transmutation only. It should not come as a\nsurprise then that Sylvie Neven finds it difficult to demarcate between alchemical\nand art technological recipes in late medieval collections of recipes. Her contribution to this volume shows that alchemical and art technological recipes shared a]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48,49\nof Alchemy.\u201d\n4\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 336\u20137; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate,\u201d 432\u20133; Pereira,\n\u201cUse of Vernacular Languages,\u201d 336; and Kahn, Alchimie et paracelsisme, 7\u20138.\n5\nHalleux, Savoir de la main, 134.\n2\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n25\nof base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into a noble or perfect one.6 To do\nso, alchemists used to perform chemical processes and manipulations which resembled those practiced by contemporary artists and artisans.\nThus, in both fields particular importance is placed on craft practices.

These works thus appear to\nbe the result of collaboration, or at least intervention, by several distinct persons.\nHowever, each person\u2019s contribution cannot necessarily be allocated according to\nthe different subjects in the book. The same hand might be responsible for both a\nmedical treatise and a collection of alchemical or art technological recipes.\nThe manuscripts under consideration were, in fact, the result of copying and\ncompiling of various sources and contributors. More precisely, these recipe books\nwere compiled from three different types of source:]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The common syntax and vocabulary used in alchemical and artistic recipes in the *Laboratories of Art* reflects both fields&#x27; shared reliance on precise procedures, ingredients, and processes. However, there are notable distinctions between the two types of recipes.

1. <strong>Similar Structures:</strong>
   Both alchemical and artistic recipes often enumerate the necessary ingredients and actions in a formulaic, step-by-step manner. These recipes might include specific actions like &quot;grind,&quot; &quot;mix,&quot; and &quot;purify,&quot; which were common to both alchemical transformations and artistic material preparations, such as pigment-making or metal purification. However, artistic recipes were more likely to specify the origin or quality of the ingredients, while alchemical recipes often focused more on the theoretical transformation of substances [Laboratories of Art, page 51](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51).

2. <strong>Use of Ratios and Proportions:</strong>
   Alchemical recipes frequently expressed quantities as ratios or proportions rather than in practical measurements, leading to instances where the recipes could be difficult to replicate. This is particularly noticeable in recipes for producing vermilion, where the incorrect ratio of mercury and sulfur is often cited. By contrast, artistic recipes typically included local measurements, making them more practical for artisans [Laboratories of Art, page 64](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64).

3. <strong>Metaphors and Symbolism in Alchemical Recipes:</strong>
   Alchemical recipes often employed symbolic or metaphorical language to designate substances or actions, reflecting the esoteric nature of the practice. This use of metaphor made alchemical recipes more arcane and secretive, and their interpretation required a degree of experience or insider knowledge. Artistic recipes, on the other hand, were more straightforward, with fewer symbolic terms [Laboratories of Art, page 64](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64).

4. <strong>Emphasis on Tools and Containers:</strong>
   Alchemical writings paid particular attention to the tools, containers, and apparatus used in the laboratory, which were often described in great detail. Some manuscripts even included illustrations of these tools. Artistic recipes rarely included such descriptions, focusing more on the material processes rather than the tools used to execute them [Laboratories of Art, page 65](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65).

Here, together with the fine arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture and jewelry making, metal carpentry, and gun casting, we find\noperations that use substance transformation, such as distillation and sublimation.\nThere is evidence that even the most important names in the history of art were\ninvolved in such workshop activities, for instance Michelangelo (1475\u20131564),\nwhose Florentine workshop, as mentioned in his correspondence with his brother,\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of\ndamaged swords and other craft objects.17 Further evidence of artists\u2019 versatile\nactivities during the Renaissance can be found in Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (1435\u2013\n1488) workshop, which specialized in painting, sculpture, casting and metal carpentry. One of the most important works created in this workshop when Leonardo\nwas still one of Verrocchio\u2019s assistants was the copper sphere on the top of the\nlantern on Filippo Brunelleschi\u2019s (1377\u20131446) dome.18 In Verrocchio\u2019s workshop,\nassistants and pupils, including Leonardo, prepared colors, glues, solvents, waxes,\nacids, alloys and so on. Being an artist in the Renaissance meant being part of a\nwider shared material culture as artisans and chymists used and developed the same\nmaterials and techniques.\nIn Biringuccio\u2019s book we find a description of a brass-making workshop he\nvisited in Milan that discusses the organization of the workshop and the artisans\u2019\nawareness of the technological and epistemological value of their works:\n[. . .] So that whoever entered that shop and saw the activity of so many persons would, I\nthink, believe as I did that he had entered an Inferno, nay, on the contrary, a Paradise, where\nthere was a mirror in which sparkled all the beauty of genius and the power of art.19\nBiringuccio underlined the frenetic and very organized work in the workshop\nstressing the beauty of the mind of the artisans and the power of art. The harmonious cooperation between artisans and the plain consciousness of the processes of\nthe art transformed the hell of hard and dirty metallurgical work into the heaven of\nthe pursuit of the artistic goal. This oxymoron referred to the infernal and paradisiacal condition of art, exalting the extremely difficult process in which raw\nmaterial is transformed into artifact, giving back an important social value to\nmanual work.\n16\nFor a recent description of the chemical utensils found in the Schloss Oberstockstall laboratory,\nsee Martino\u0301n-Torres, \u201cTools of Chymist\u201d; \u201cProbierbu\u0308chlein,\u201d 166\u20139; Biringuccio, De la\npirotechnia (1977) 47r; and Agricola, De re metallica (1556), 174\u2013208.\n17\nMichelangelo, Carteggio, vol.

Bernardoni\nIn the Renaissance technical tradition the bottega (workshop) was a place for\nwork and not yet a space to conduct modern scientific research. Research on\ntechnology and natural phenomena was carried out thanks to the curiosity and the\nfree enterprise of each individual artist; workshop mentality was conservative and\ntechnical knowledge was usually applied to technologically consolidated goals. The\nworkshop was a place to produce specific artistic, technological and pharmacological objects yet it offered artisans the tools and the experiences to venture beyond\nthe \u2018normalized activity\u2019. We know several cases of painters involved in alchemy,\nsuch as Parmigianino (1503\u20131540), Cosimo Rosselli (d.1578), Lorenzo Lotto\n(1480\u20131556/7) and Domenico Beccafumi (1484\u20131551).20 From the latter we have\na series of engravings that represent some aspects of \u2018chem-alchemical\u2019 laboratory\nactivity: heating systems, smelting furnaces, cucurbits, alembics and balanced\nscales (Fig. 1).21 Alchemists used the same technological apparatuses and devices\nas artisans and alchemical research was often carried out along with chemical and\nmetallurgical activities, for instance, at the Fonderia by the Medici family in\nFlorence, or several other places in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe.22\nLeonardo and the \u2018Chemical\u2019 Arts\nVery rarely have historians seen Leonardo from the perspective of his direct\ninvolvement in the chemicals arts. Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance\ntransformation, he can be seen as a witness and a protagonist of the epistemological\n20\nFor more information on the relation between artists and alchemy during the Renaissance, see\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations; Newman, Promethean Ambitions, 115\u201363; Ferino-Pagden\net al., Parmigianino, 15\u20137; Calvesi, Arte e alchimia; Lennep, L\u2019art alchimique; and Conticelli,\nAlchimia e le arti, 13\u201333.\n21\nGabriele, Incisioni alchemico-metallurgiche.\n22\nOn the Medici\u2019s Fonderia, see this volume: Kieffer and Beretta.

His\nattention was specifically focused on alchemy\u2019s claims to overturn the relationship\nbetween art and nature; however, he also stressed that alchemy was worthy of\npursuit as it might produce knowledge that could improve the condition of\nmankind:\nMan is involved with things produced by nature and nature does not change the ordinary\nkinds of things it creates in the same way that from time to time the things created by man\nare changed; and indeed man is nature\u2019s chief instrument, because nature is concerned only\nwith the production of elementary things, but from these elementary things man produces\nan infinite number of compounds, although he has no power to create any natural things\nexcept another like himself, that is his children.

She will completely cure you of your\n\nPages 83:\n60\nA.

As Avicenna had already claimed in his Latin translation of Kitab ash-Shifa\u2019 (De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum), Leonardo\nstressed man\u2019s perception of the purity of natural elements was neither highly\ndeveloped nor sensitive enough to be able to precisely quantify the proportions\nrequired to produce the substantial form of different metals.26\nIf we assume within the tradition of Italian \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 this \u2018epistemological approach\u2019 was oriented to separate true and false alchemy and culminated in the\nwork of Biringuccio, then the manuscripts of Leonardo could be seen as one of the\nmain sources of \u2018chemical technologies\u2019 from the end of fifteenth and beginning of\nsixteenth centuries and one of the most important sources for the studies of the\nnatural phenomena of transformation in a cultural context separate but in many case\noverlapping with the world of alchemy.\n24\n\u201cE questo non e\u0300 in alcuno altro senso, perche\u0301 sol s\u2019astendono nelle cose che al continuo produce\nla natura, la qual non varia le ordinarie spezie delle cose da lei create, come si variano di tempo in\ntempo le cose create dall\u2019omo, massimo strumento di natura.

His tireless sketching during his entire career produced\na very large and uncommon collection of manuscripts that allow us to understand\nand visualize many tools, instruments and chemical processes studied, developed\nand used during the Renaissance.\nAn activity that was a sort of flywheel in involving Leonardo in the study of the\nmany aspects of bronze casting was the project of the Equestrian monument for\nFrancesco Sforza. This was a very large bronze statue that was never cast but\nstudied and worked on by Leonardo for almost 20 years. The main difficulty of this\ncast was the size, more than 7 m tall and almost 70 tons in weight, and the plan to\nrealize it in a single pouring. To organize the foundry and the molding process,\nLeonardo studied artillery casting, furnaces and the materials used in the molding,\nlike sand, wax, gypsum, clay, brick powder, carrying out several experiments to\nbetter understand their chemical-physical properties.27\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are among the most important sources for the artillery\nproduction process, surely the most detailed and best illustrated of the fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries. In some sheets of the Codex Atlanticus, for instance, we may\nfind the first and only reference for the production of iron shaft-soldering bombards,\nsuch as the famous Belgian Mons Meg, created with a hammer at the forge. To\nminimize the inaccurate results of forge hammering he planned a draw bench\nmachine to make homogeneous iron shafts in order to simplify the welding and\nproduce stronger cannons (fol. 10r, 11r, 15v, 41r).\nSeveral studies are dedicated to the casting process of bronze bombards.28\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are once again the most ancient source which make it\npossible to visualize the several phases of the molding process both for the tromba\n(chase) and the coda (breech), the two parts of a gun which were assembled by\nthreaded coupling. Leonardo gives us very detailed drawings, such as the channel\nfor pouring the bronze into the mold during casting (Codex Atlanticus, fol. 46r, 53r,\n60r, 61r, 937v) (Fig. 2).\nLeonardo\u2019s studies on reverberatory furnaces is one of the best examples to\ndemonstrate that his mental approach to technological problems went beyond the\ncreation of a specific process or device. His detailed drawings of furnaces based on\nvery close observation allowed him to let his curiosity take him beyond the\nimprovement of the technical apparatus towards some very interesting observations\nand considerations on the nature of fire and its penetrative power.\nFolio 87r of the Codex Atlanticus portrays several kinds of reverberatory furnaces and among them there is a drawing of a curious and obscure apparatus. The\ndrawing portrays a fusion chamber above a very tall platform connected to a firebox\nby two vertical ducts. On the left there is also another duct that probably conducts\n27\nBernardoni, \u201cLeonardo and the Equestrian Monument\u201d; and Brugnoli, \u201cScultura di Leonardo.\u201d\nBernardoni, Esplosioni, fusioni e trasmutazioni, 26\u201335; Brioist, Vinci, Homme de guerre, 105\u2013\n14.\n28\n\nPages 85:\n62\nA.

The note under the drawing helps us interpret the\ndevice as a study for amplifying the penetrative action of fire: \u201cThe greater the\nnatural motion of the fire or the greater its weight, the greater its impulsive force\u201d\n(Fig. 3).29 Leonardo talks about fire in the same terms as the weight of bodies, so he\ninterprets it as a hard material particulate flow, able to penetrate the body and break\nthe link of its particles. In Aristotelian matter theory, fire is the lightest element that\nfinds its natural place at the most peripheral region of the sub-lunar world. Just as a\nstone falls towards the earth to reach its natural place, fire goes in the opposite\ndirection, rising to the far reaches of the sky; the longer the distance, the quicker it\nrises. So towards the vertical ducts of these experimental furnaces, the particles of\nfire would have to increase their impact speed on the mass of metal inside the fusion\nchamber. The short sentence below the drawing of the furnace, along with many\nother observations of the physical status of the four elements and other natural\nsubstances, enables us to reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s theory of matter as a sort of a\n\u2018Aristotelian corpuscolarism\u2019 and a kinetic theory of heat/fire in which the melting\nof metal or the dissolution of a substance by fire depends on the percussion of a flow\nof particles.30 This interpretation finds confirmation in several reverberatory furnace drawings made with bent surfaces to drive the flow of fire into the middle of\nthe fusion chamber (Codex Atlanticus, fol. 1103r, 548r, 580v, 82v) (Fig. 4).\n29\n\u201cquanto piu\u0300 il moto natural del foco o del peso sia lungo, piu\u0300 vale la sua percussion.\u201d (Leonardo,\nCodex Atlanticus, fol. 87r).\n30\nBernardoni, \u201cElementi, sostanze naturali.\u201d\n\nPages 86:\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n63\nFig. 3 Leonardo, Technological application of the element of fire, Codex Atlanticus, fol. 87r,\nBiblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan (Image taken from Codex Atlanticus, Hoepli edition, Milan, 1894\u2013\n1904)\nFurnaces become Leonardo\u2019s instrument for studying and observing fire. A\ndrawing on a folio in the Codex Arundel representing a tower furnace, used in the\nMiddle Ages by alchemists for distillation, assumes a very important epistemological value (Fig. 5). The drawing presents an apparently accurate copy of this\nfurnace\u2019s vertical section and, when we read the note below, we understand that\nhis interest is not in the technological device but the transformation of the elements\ninvolved in the combustion process inside it. The note below the furnace helps us\nunderstand that\nonce you have dealt with the motion of heavy solids, deal with heavy liquids and with air\nand with the motion of fire.

Leonardo\u2019s goals are both technological and scientific; the\nfire works as a drill. If this were to be verified, it could be used in some technological application but it could also assume a more general scientific and philosophical\nexplanation because the power of fire, like the power of the other elements (water,\nair and earth), manifests itself in the form of a spiral\u2014the natural screw. The power\nof the screw could be seen in the vortices of water and air, but also in Brunelleschi\u2019s\nbigger cranes and powerful technological elevator devices that become an analogic\nexplanation for the forces operating in nature.32\nAnother very interesting case involving the chemical equipment studied by\nLeonardo is the development of the alembic refrigerator system. In the Codex\nAtlanticus there are some drawings (fol. 912r, 1114r a\u2013b, 216r, 989r, 1118r)\n31\n\u201cTrattato che a\u0300i de\u2019 moti de\u2019 solidi gravi, trata de\u2019 gravi liquidi e dell\u2019aria e de\u2019 moti del foco, e\ncol moto di questo foco fa conparatione del moto delle revertigine dell\u2019aria e dell\u2019acqua, e\ntroverrai moti trivellanti del foco a ffarlo potente alle fusioni colle sua revolutioni, la qual cosa\nfarai co\u2019 regisstri e con acqua bollente.\u201d (Leonardo, Codex Arundel, fol. 145v).\n32\nPedretti, Leonardo architetto, 9\u201312; and Galluzzi, Mechanical Marvels, 55\u20136.\n\nPages 88:\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n65\nFig. 5 Leonardo, Drilling\nmotion of fire, Codex\nArundel, fol. 145v,\nCourtesy of British Library,\nLondon\nwhere we can see a very interesting attempt to develop a basin refrigerator system\nby separating the basin and the stove to prevent a thermal shock in the neck of the\ncucurbit (fol. 989r) (Fig. 6). For the refrigerator system Leonardo also developed an\nalembic lid with a chamber along its external surface where fresh water could flow\ninside (Fig. 7). Scholars had already discussed this very modern solution in order to\nunderstand its pertinence to a real alembic or to an unrealized design.33 The\nwireframe representation leads us to think that it was made of glass, but its\nmorphological complexity tends to suggest it was made by hammering soldered\ncopper.\nIn folio 216r of Codex Atlanticus we have another interesting study for casting a\ntraditional alembic (Fig. 8). This is the only source known to me with specifications\nabout creating and conserving an alembic. First of all, writes Leonardo, the model\nof the alembic in turned wood has to be built, and then it has to be refined with clay\nwool-cloth clippings. The external plaster mold has to be built on it in two valves.\n33\nReti, \u201cArti chimiche di Leonardo\u201d (1952a; 1952b).\n\nPages 89:\n66\nA.

It was most likely copper or bronze, however, we\ncannot exclude the use of glass. Leonardo, in fact, preferred using glass alembics\nbecause of the possibility of observing condensation phenomena inside them. In a\nfragmentary sheet of Manuscript E he specifies:\nSuch is the nature of the condensation of the walls, constraining the space enclosed between\nthem, as is that of the enclosed [space], multiplied by the enclosing [walls]. This is proved\nwith the smoke generated in an enclosed space, as is seen in the glass vessels with which\ndistilling is done, in which it is easily recognized at what part of this transparent vase the\nsmoke condenses more or less and . . .34\n34\nLeonardo, Manuscript E, 8 [fol. 3r, I].\n\nPages 90:\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n67\nFig. 8 Leonardo, Basin refrigerator alembic, Codex Atlanticus, fol. 216r, Biblioteca Ambrosiana,\nMilan (Image taken from Codex Atlanticus, Hoepli edition, Milan, 1894\u20131904)\nThe use of glass in the casting is very difficult because of its viscosity. The only\nreference to this technique in Leonardo is in relation to the casting of a glass bell jar\nin Manuscript B, in which he says he uses a metallurgical furnace to pour the glass\ninside a very hot mold: \u201cPrepare the furnace in the usual manner, that is, for\nbombards, and when the glass is melted, pour it into the red\u2013hot form.\u201d35\n35\nLeonardo, Manuscript B, 19 [fol. 10v, IV].\n\nPages 91:\n68\nA. Bernardoni\nMoreover, on the other pages of his manuscripts Leonardo confirms his propensity to use glass for various apparatuses such as the transparent box to see the\nmotion of the flowing water through a hole in the bottom (Codex Atlanticus, fol.\n219r) or motion generated in a mass of water by a surface wave (Codex Hammer,\nfol. 9r and 29v). We also find a transparent glass cylinder for studying the flame of a\ncandle (Codex Atlanticus, fol. 226r) and, most of all, the drawing of a glassdrinking horn with which Leonardo says he is able to observe free atoms moved\nby the water.36 The topic of atoms in Leonardo is a very articulated question,\ninterwoven with the theme of the essere del nulla (being of nothing), for which\nthere is a specific literature.37 Here it is enough to make a brief reference to this\ntheme, just to stress it could also be discussed in terms of the observation of\nphysical-chemical phenomena. Leonardo\u2019s atoms do not have qualitative-chemical\nspecifications but they have to be interpreted as physical primary matter particles\nexisting in nature without any chemical or physical properties. They are the result\nof substance consumption and we can see them in the form of dust, smoke, or as\ntiny, undefined pieces of matter:\nThe air that successively surrounds a moving object moving through it makes various\nmotions within itself. This can be seen in the dust particles [attimi] found in the sphere of\nthe sun, when they penetrate through some window into an obscure location, and when a\nstone is thrown into these dust particles [attimi], along the length of this solar ray, you can\nsee the dust particles [attimi] turning about at that location where the path made by the\nmoving object was filled in again by the air, as has been proved in the fifth.38\nAnd again:\nIt follows therefore, from what I say, that the atmosphere acquires its blueness from the\nparticles which catch the luminous rays of the sun. We may also observe the difference\nbetween the atoms of dust and those of smoke seen in the sun\u2019s rays as they pass through the\nchinks of the walls in dark rooms, that the one seems the color of ashes, and the other\u2014the\nthin smoke\u2014seems of a most beautiful blue.39\nEach substance could be destroyed by separation, going beyond the limits of\nminima naturalia\u2014the last specification of substantial form on matter. Significantly, even though the sentence is partially crossed out, Leonardo writes the\n\u201catoms are not a part of the substance from which they are born,\u201d as he wants to\ntake under consideration the possibility of the strangeness of the inner composition\nof substance.40 Atoms as we will also see in the case of Biringuccio are something\n36\n\u201cVetro a cio\u0300 che si vegga li attimi nell\u2019acqua che si move.\u201d (Leonardo, Codex Atlanticus,\nfol. 589v).\n37\nMarinoni, \u201cL\u2019Essere del nulla,\u201d 209\u201332; Bernardoni, \u201cElementi, sostanze naturali,\u201d 99\u2013104;\nBeretta, \u201cLeonardo and Lucretius\u201d; and Nanni, \u201cLucrezio.\u201d\n38\nLeonardo, Manuscript F, 138 [fol. 74v, IV].

In the Pirotechnia (Fig. 9), we again find the two traditional contradictory\nopinions on alchemy: negative towards the alchemists who hide their art behind\nesotericism, magic, alchemical authority and those who practice chemical process\nwithout ratio and empirical control, and positive in relation to the improvement of\nmankind:\nHow many alchemists have I heard lamenting, one because by some unfortunate chance he\nhad spilled his whole composition in the ashes; another because he had been deceived by\nthe excessive strength of the fire, so that the substance of his materials had been burned and\nthe spirits inadvertently allowed to escape; and yet another because he had poor and feeble\nmaterials! In a word, one for one reason, and one for another, in order to hide either their\ndeception or their ignorance, all defend themselves and make excuses for their art.41\nMoreover, after marking his distance from false and sophistic alchemy,\nBiringuccio returned to what he called \u201ctrue alchemy\u201d with very positive opinions,\ntalking about it as a philosophical and technological activity grounded on reason\nand empirical experimentation which, even when following the illusory goal of\nmetal transmutation or the perfective and healthy elixir, discovered new substances,\nmedicine and technological processes. After a rational and empirical codification of\nthe chemical process and substance discovered and prepared by it, true alchemy\nremained to Biringuccio the most important \u201cart\u201d for studying the secrets of nature:\nThus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art [alchemy] is the origin and\nfoundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.\nBut he who practices it must be ignorant neither of cause nor of natural effects, and not too\npoor to support the expense. Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41.

Biringuccio, De\nla pirotechnia, Venice,\n1540, frontispiece; courtesy\nof Museo Galileo Library\n\u201cPhilosophical alchemy,\u201d as Biringuccio calls it, is for him a scientific discipline\nthat directly studies natural phenomena and could be seen as an alternative\napproach to the theoretical speculation of scholastic philosophy.43 Alchemy was\nhere presented and discussed from a technical and theoretical point of view and,\neven more importantly, it was classified as a specific art of fire placed close to, but\nseparate from, the arts of distillation. This is an important distinction from which\nBiringuccio\u2019s original approach to the arts of fire emerges and that distinguishes\nhim, for instance, from Georg Agricola who, at almost the same time, wrote his De\nre metallica in which he outlined the general arts of metals related to mining and\nmetallurgy. Biringuccio expanded his perspective to include all the arts of fire,\nincluding, artillery, making gunpowder, acids preparation, pottery, goldsmithing,\nfireworks, generic distillation arts, as well as alchemy.44 If we accept his conditions,\n43\nSee Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1914), 27\u201340; Perifano, \u201cAlchimie\u201d; Smith, Body of the\nArtisan, 143\u20134; and Bernardoni, La conoscenza del fare, 669.\n44\nBiringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977), fol. 123r\u20134r.\n\nPages 94:\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n71\nalchemy and pyrotechnics are not in contradiction, rather, in so far as they are used\nin the same philosophical concepts and the same operational practices, alchemy\ncould be considered a continuity of the arts of fire. Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia, in\nfact, could be interpreted as a sort of normalized alchemy, that is, an \u2018engineering\ndiscipline\u2019 founded on a general theory of matter and in codified operative practices\nto control the power of fire during matter transformation processes.\nThe importance of Biringuccio\u2019s book in the history of metallurgy and chemistry\nis well known. Along with Agricola\u2019s works, it was a most important source for\nmany chemical technology devices and processes.45 Although Pirotechnia was\nessentially a practical treatise, the author\u2019s intention was to go beyond the writing\ndown of know how towards a theoretical consideration about the nature and\ntransformation of substances. As can be seen in many passages of the book,\nBiringuccio developed independent ideas on these issues, combining different\npositions on the mineral world from philosophical and alchemical traditions, in\nparticular from Albertus Magnus\u2019s (1193\u20131280) De mineralibus, and the Summa\nperfectionis of Pseudo-Geber, but he was also influenced by the new concept of\nsubstantial form introduced by Augustine Nifo (1473\u2013c.1538) in the Aristotelian\ntradition of Padua, who considered the essence of natural substances to be the order\nand internal structure of sub-particles.46\nBiringuccio classified mineral substances on the basis of their macroscopic\nproperties observable during metallurgical processes and starting from these he\ntried to give a description of metal into the frame of a general theory to explain their\nmutual physical-chemical relationship. His model of perfection was gold; its gloss,\ncompact structure, resistance to oxidation and calcination made this the mineral\nsubstance with the most balanced internal particle structure:\n[. . .] Its original and peculiar materials are none other than elemental substances, with the\nquantity and quality of each proportioned equally one to the other and very finely purified.\nFrom this union of elements which are of equal force there is born a pleasing and perfect\nelemental mixture, and then after fermentation and decoction the elements finally become\nfixed, permanent, and joined together in such a union that they are almost inseparable, so\nthat by the power of the heavens or of time or of the order of the most wise Nature, or by all\nthese together, these substances are converted into that metallic body called gold.47\nThe other metals, starting with silver, have an internal growing disequilibrium\nthat manifests itself by observing external physical-chemical properties. This classification becomes even more evident with the category of semi-minerals in which,\nfor example, Biringuccio includes substances such as mercury, marcasite, sulphur\nand antimony that seem to be progressive stages of the metal generation process\n45\nSee Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1914), VII\u2013XXV, and De la pirotechnia (1977), pp. I\u2013\nXXXIII; and Cipriani, \u201cAgricola e Biringuccio.\u201d\n46\nEmerton, Scientific Reinterpretation of Form, 97\u2013105; and Bernardoni, La conoscenza del fare,\n71\u2013114.\n47\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 26\u20137.

Bernardoni\ndefined on the basis of their appearance and their chemical-physical behavior\nduring empirical manipulation. The case of antimony is one of the best examples:\n[It] is a composition made by Nature to create a metallic mineral that is overflowing with an\nundue proportion of hot and dry material and with its moisture poorly mixed, with an effect\nwholly contrary to the composition of metals. Therefore, it comes to be, like quicksilver, a\nmineral deformity and monstrosity among metals. Or it might be a material that is about to\nreach metallic perfection, but is hindered from doing so by being mined too soon. I am\npersuaded to this opinion by seeing in it so many parts similar to those of metals [. . .].48\nAs we have seen in Leonardo, Biringuccio also used specifically designed tools\nand metallurgical processes to observe natural phenomena and to underline the\nimportance of empirical research.\nDescribing the several aspects of distillation technology, Biringuccio talked\nabout the possibility of going beyond the physical dimension of the four elements\nin order to reach an undetermined status of matter, identified by the alchemist as the\n\u201cquintessence\u201d:\nBy means of the art of distillation many say that you proceed from element to element,\nmaking them subtle and separating them so that at the end the materials are reduced to such\na point that they no longer have a resemblance to any of the substances of the four elements.\nAnd then they say that they have reduced them to one, which they call the Quintessence.49\nBiringuccio did not believe that this physical status of matter could be identified\nwith quintessence but it is very interesting to read the possibility of having a\nphysical dimension of matter beyond the four-elementary specifications achieved\nthrough a technological process.\nBiringuccio did not give an organic and systematic explanation of this status of\nmatter but, as in the case of Leonardo, from his book arises a corpuscular concept of\nmatter in which he spoke about atoms, giving examples of their physical dimension.\nParticularly interesting was his analogical explanation of the compactness and the\nregular size of the particle of gold as it is seen in the separating process separating\nsilver and gold: silver turns into solution with nitric acid while gold remains behind\nas a solid particle: \u201cIt [goes] here and there, wandering about in the water like\natoms. Because these are tiny and subtle things, they reduce the power of water.\u201d50\nAtoms are light, small and are driven by water in casual motion. Even though it is\nimpossible to talk about atomistic conception of nature, it is very interesting to note\nhow Biringuccio does not limit himself to technical considerations about metallurgical process but, uses his tools (cucurbit, alembic, furnaces etc.) to observe matter\ntransformation processes in order to have a deeper understanding of natural and\nartificial substances.\n48\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 91.

For the Italian, see Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977),\nfol. 71r.\n\nPages 96:\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n73\nThe atomic dimension evoked by Biringuccio seems to involve the physical\nstatus of matter and, even though he did not have a clear position on it, his reference\nto the genesis of substances reveals to us his interest and involvement on the\nproblem of generation and diversification of natural species:\nI am sure that you understand that of all the things created by the most high God Himself or\nby Nature at His command, not one\u2014even though it be an atom or the smallest worm\u2014has\nbeen produced without some particular gift.51\nThese incursions into problematic topics of natural philosophy are clear evidence of Biringuccio\u2019s willingness to participate in the debate on natural and\ntechnological phenomena. Apart from the question of how this would fit into the\ncontext of natural philosophy and the genesis of substance, it is evident that the\nproblem of the composition of substances was a debated topic and Biringuccio is\none of the best examples of this interest in the first half of the sixteenth century.52\nThis concept of atoms\u2014as opposed to the minima naturalia developed in the\nAristotelian medieval tradition\u2014seems to be close to the Democritean concept,\neven though Biringuccio, and Leonardo, rejected the mechanical explication of\nsubstance composition by continuing to talk of Aristotelian elements as a final part\nof substance constituents. As can be seen in the cases of Leonardo and Biringuccio,\nRenaissance technicians seem to consider atoms as pieces of undetermined matter,\nas something existing beyond the limits of the physical dimension that could not be\nreached by mechanical (by cutting) or chemical (by distillation) means. A very\ninteresting partial confirmation of this comes from the curious assumption during\nthe late Middle Ages that atoms were the last division of the official weight set. We\nfind this in the writings of Antonio Averlino detto il Filarete (c.1400\u2013c.1469),\nGirolamo Cardano and Gerolamo Cattaneo and atoms were used as units of linear\nmeasurement in several North Italian towns. This remained in place until the\nintroduction of the modern metric system.53\nBiringuccio\u2019s scepticism about alchemists and the bookish tradition drove him\nto stress the importance of factual verification in the advancement of learning as the\ntrue foundation of the knowledge of nature. Biringuccio\u2019s idea of knowledge as\nbased on factual verification is to be situated in the technical culture of which he is\npart. To stress the importance of factual knowledge he underlines the importance of\n51\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 114. For the Italian, see Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977),\nfol. 36v.\n52\nFor a more detailed analysis of Biringuccio\u2019s concept of \u2018atoms\u2019 and his theory of matter, see\nBernardoni, La conoscenza del fare, 78\u2013105. For a general analysis on the medieval and Renaissance concept of \u2018matter\u2019, see Murdoch, \u201cMinima Naturalia\u201d; and Grellard &amp; Robert, Atomism.\n53\nFilarete, Trattato di architettura, 470; Cardano, Practica arithmetica, ch. LXIII; and Cattaneo,\nDell\u2019arte del misurare.

Bernardoni\nevidence from nature whatever its origin (books, nature, oral tradition) and\nconcludes:\nI have done this willingly in order that you may acquire more learning and because I am\ncertain that new information always gives birth in men\u2019s mind to new discoveries and so to\nfurther information. Indeed I am certain that it is the key that arouses intelligent men and\nmakes them, if they wish, arrive at certain conclusions that they could not have reached\nwithout such a foundation, or even nearly approached.54\nThe advancement of learning for Biringuccio depends on continual \u201cdiscoveries\u201d and \u201cnew information,\u201d that results in two processes of knowledge: the first\nleads to the creation of new artificial products and the second determines the\nincrease in and deepening of knowledge about nature. As is clear from this passage,\nhuman creativity can be awakened by practical problems. And once such \u201cnew\ninformation\u201d is integrated into the wealth of knowledge this can lead humanity to\nthe opening of new paths of research.55\nEvery discovery and invention is a step that could widen our knowledge horizons, each new observation and each new technique, even if they remain unused for\na long time, belong to the growing social legacy that Leonardo da Vinci called\n\u201csecond nature.\u201d56 The notitie nuove is the lifeblood of the process by which man\npenetrates the secrets of nature, thus creating a substrate of knowledge that stimulates minds to look for new inventions. It would certainly be excessive and\ninappropriate to evoke the positivist image of a Biringuccio paladin of the experimental method; however, the epistemological instances placed in Pirotechnia do\ngrant the Siennese engineer a place in the tradition of technical knowledge in the\nlate fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.57\nBibliography\nAbbri, Ferdinando. 2009.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a summary of *Laboratories of Art* from pages 80 to 101, focusing on artisanal processes and the works of Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci:

### Overview:
- <strong>Artisanal Knowledge and Workshop Culture:</strong>
  Renaissance workshops, like those of Leonardo and Michelangelo, combined artistic, metallurgical, and alchemical knowledge. Artists engaged in practical tasks such as metalworking, casting, and creating alloys. The lines between art and alchemy were blurred, with figures like Biringuccio describing the transformative processes in workshops as both infernal and paradisiacal.

- <strong>Leonardo&#x27;s Engagement with Alchemy and Technology:</strong>
  Leonardo da Vinci’s work highlights his direct involvement with chemical arts, beyond his well-known contributions to painting and sculpture. His extensive notes on matter transformation, fire, and natural phenomena reflect his deep engagement with the philosophical and practical aspects of alchemy. Leonardo&#x27;s projects, such as the equestrian monument for Francesco Sforza, reveal his profound understanding of metallurgy, furnace construction, and material manipulation.

- <strong>Biringuccio’s *Pirotechnia*:</strong>
  Biringuccio&#x27;s *Pirotechnia* is a central text discussed in this section. It provides detailed descriptions of workshops and metallurgical processes, emphasizing the skill and intellectual contribution of artisans. Biringuccio highlights both the practical and philosophical aspects of alchemy, acknowledging the failures of false alchemists while championing the empirical study of nature’s secrets.

### Quotes:
- &quot;The harmonious cooperation between artisans... transformed the hell of hard and dirty metallurgical work into the heaven of the pursuit of the artistic goal.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 80](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=80)
- Leonardo described fire as a force &quot;able to penetrate the body and break the link of its particles,&quot; reflecting his deep study of matter through furnaces. [Laboratories of Art, page 86](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=86)

As Avicenna had already claimed in his Latin translation of Kitab ash-Shifa\u2019 (De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum), Leonardo\nstressed man\u2019s perception of the purity of natural elements was neither highly\ndeveloped nor sensitive enough to be able to precisely quantify the proportions\nrequired to produce the substantial form of different metals.26\nIf we assume within the tradition of Italian \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 this \u2018epistemological approach\u2019 was oriented to separate true and false alchemy and culminated in the\nwork of Biringuccio, then the manuscripts of Leonardo could be seen as one of the\nmain sources of \u2018chemical technologies\u2019 from the end of fifteenth and beginning of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=81\nPages: 81\nactivity: heating systems, smelting furnaces, cucurbits, alembics and balanced\nscales (Fig. 1).21 Alchemists used the same technological apparatuses and devices\nas artisans and alchemical research was often carried out along with chemical and\nmetallurgical activities, for instance, at the Fonderia by the Medici family in\nFlorence, or several other places in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe.22\nLeonardo and the \u2018Chemical\u2019 Arts\nVery rarely have historians seen Leonardo from the perspective of his direct\ninvolvement in the chemicals arts.

Although in the Chapter of Gold\nhe so degraded Alchemy with very weak reasons, as one who had had a great deal of\nexperience, and not a lot of science, since he did not even know that Alberto and many\nothers had written of it. But still, we are obliged him for having been, beyond his great\npractical experience, a very loyal and truthful man, and most liberal of his treasures.9\nThe most important consequence of this inclusion of Biringuccio as a protagonist in the alchemical debate happens in the mid-sixteenth century; the Quaestio de\nalchimia can no longer exclude the position of the technician directly involved in\nthe transformation of substances.10 Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=157\nPages: 157\npatron a keen interest in alchemy, was meant to have taken part\u2014but his premature\ndeath prevented his involvement.

On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=100\nPages: 100\nMedieval and Early Modern Corpuscular Matter Theories, eds.

Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41.

In the Pirotechnia (Fig. 9), we again find the two traditional contradictory\nopinions on alchemy: negative towards the alchemists who hide their art behind\nesotericism, magic, alchemical authority and those who practice chemical process\nwithout ratio and empirical control, and positive in relation to the improvement of\nmankind:\nHow many alchemists have I heard lamenting, one because by some unfortunate chance he\nhad spilled his whole composition in the ashes; another because he had been deceived by\nthe excessive strength of the fire, so that the substance of his materials had been burned and\nthe spirits inadvertently allowed to escape; and yet another because he had poor and feeble]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=156\nPages: 156\nIn this process of reconfiguring Florentine arts and crafts, alchemy played an\nexceedingly important role, both as a fashionable scientific discipline with not\nparticularly strong academic ties and as a useful set of experimental practices in\nwhich several crafts helped artisans quench their thirst for innovation and realize\ntheir socio-cultural ambitions. I shall not explore here the spread of interest in\nalchemy in Florence at beginning of the sixteenth century, a theme already effectively surveyed in Alfredo Perifano\u2019s book on Cosimo I\u2019s alchemical passion.24\nI shall instead take into consideration the development of alchemy in the Palazzo\nVecchio\u2019s fonderia and the Casino, sites where its relation with the chemical arts\nand technological innovations became apparent.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s engagement with alchemy can be understood through his direct involvement in what is termed the &quot;chemical arts.&quot; His work frequently combined artistic craftsmanship with scientific inquiry into the transformation of matter. Some key points include:

1. <strong>Leonardo&#x27;s Practical and Philosophical Involvement</strong>:  
   Leonardo&#x27;s engagement with alchemy was not merely theoretical. He was deeply involved in practical processes such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and material transformations. His notes reveal an epistemological approach to separating &quot;true&quot; alchemy—rooted in empirical study—from the more mystical or speculative forms of the practice. He criticized the alchemical pursuit of gold-making but saw the potential of alchemical techniques in studying nature&#x27;s processes. He worked with furnaces, heating systems, smelting devices, and chemical equipment that artisans and alchemists both used [Laboratories of Art, pages 81-83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=81).

2. <strong>Alchemy in Artistic Practice</strong>:  
   In his artistic endeavors, such as his plans for the equestrian monument for Francesco Sforza, Leonardo&#x27;s knowledge of alchemical techniques was essential. His study of bronze casting, furnaces, and chemical reactions fed into his artistic practice, illustrating how art and science intersected in his work. He also sketched numerous devices for chemical and metallurgical processes, bridging the gap between his artistic and scientific contributions [Laboratories of Art, page 83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

3. <strong>Leonardo&#x27;s Skepticism of Transmutation</strong>:  
   Leonardo questioned the claims of alchemists who sought to transmute base metals into gold, aligning with Avicenna’s views that humanity lacked the precision to reproduce the natural genesis of substances. However, he still acknowledged the utility of alchemical methods for technological innovations and the study of material processes, particularly in metallurgy [Laboratories of Art, page 83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures.

Bernardoni\nIn the Renaissance technical tradition the bottega (workshop) was a place for\nwork and not yet a space to conduct modern scientific research. Research on\ntechnology and natural phenomena was carried out thanks to the curiosity and the\nfree enterprise of each individual artist; workshop mentality was conservative and\ntechnical knowledge was usually applied to technologically consolidated goals. The\nworkshop was a place to produce specific artistic, technological and pharmacological objects yet it offered artisans the tools and the experiences to venture beyond\nthe \u2018normalized activity\u2019. We know several cases of painters involved in alchemy,\nsuch as Parmigianino (1503\u20131540), Cosimo Rosselli (d.1578), Lorenzo Lotto\n(1480\u20131556/7) and Domenico Beccafumi (1484\u20131551).20 From the latter we have\na series of engravings that represent some aspects of \u2018chem-alchemical\u2019 laboratory\nactivity: heating systems, smelting furnaces, cucurbits, alembics and balanced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally. On the other\nhand, the basic materials of their artisanal labors\u2014gold and silver\u2014held a central\n5\nSee Smith, Body of the Artisan.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=154\nPages: 154\na city \u201cfounded upon the guilds and trade.\u201d17\nThis new configuration of professional relations led to a thorough reassessment\nof the locations where cultural and economic activities were conducted, articulating\nin an experimental key the arts, which previously had been regarded as the fruit of\nindividual dexterity rather than the outcome of a deliberate cultural program. In\nmany cases the architectural changes were not apparent, since many kinds of\nartisans (e.g., the goldsmiths) kept on using the same premises they had occupied\nfor generations. However, even in such examples of apparent continuity the arts\nwere seen as vectors for change. This perception found visual expression in a\nvolume of engravings, based on drawings by Jan van der Straet (1523\u20131605)\n(or Giovanni Stradano), that bore the significant title Nova Reperta, commissioned\nby the Florentine academician Luigi Alamanni (1558\u20131603) around the end of the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds. The rise of\nthese hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of laboratories in\nwhich art technologies and alchemy were brought together, the first of these being\nat Renaissance courts.

Finally,\na garden planted with botanic samples on the roof of the Loggia dei Lanzi echoed\nback to the fonderia, situated on the same floor.1\nAccording to the archival sources, Francesco I had the original idea of putting\ntogether collections and workshops (Ferdinando I\u2019s brother and predecessor). He\nhad the necessary philosophical education and cultural knowledge to imagine and\nexecute this complex yet coherent project.2 From the beginning it was the prince\nalchemist\u2019s brainchild to establish a program gathering naturalia, artificialia and\nknow how of all kinds under one roof, that would work together like an \u2018encyclopaedic machine\u2019, a kind of monumental clock.

Finally, because their efficacy\nwas widely accepted and praised, they were an excellent means for Ferdinando I to\ncreate a regular, dependant and indebted clientele.\nAs a result, the fonderia played a double role: it manufactured finished products\n(the remedies) to be distributed and it produced raw materials for the other\nworkshops of the Uffizi. This second part was very important for Ferdinando I\u2019s\nproject, because the workshops were arranged so that they could collaborate, one\nwith the other, avoiding the need to bring expensive and indubitably less well\nadapted materials from outside.\n\u201cFor knowledge itself was a power whereby he knoweth.\u201d51 The Medici always\nconsidered knowledge the key to power in politics.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Artisanal knowledge and workshop culture during the Renaissance period played a significant role in shaping both material and intellectual life. Here are the key aspects of this relationship:

1. <strong>Artisan-Scholar Hybrid Figures</strong>:
   Artisans such as glassmakers, gold- and silversmiths, and porcelain producers often possessed knowledge that was both practical and scholarly. These artisan-scholars bridged the gap between hands-on craftwork and bookish learning, engaging with alchemical texts and scientific principles in their work. By the 17th century, these figures were key players in the advancement of both the decorative arts and scientific alchemy. They became central to the epistemic exchanges between scholarly and artisanal cultures [Laboratories of Art, pages 16, 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16).

2. <strong>Shared Spaces and Tools</strong>:
   Artisanal workshops and alchemical laboratories shared a material culture. The instruments used—such as furnaces, alembics, and smelting devices—were common to both artisans and alchemists. This overlap of tools facilitated the exchange of knowledge between the two groups. Workshops became spaces of experimentation where artisans, such as Leonardo da Vinci and others, engaged in what could be seen as proto-scientific investigations while also producing art [Laboratories of Art, page 81](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=81).

3. <strong>Workshop Mentality</strong>:
   The Renaissance workshop was primarily a place of production, with a focus on technological goals rather than scientific research. However, the experience gained through producing artistic and technological objects offered artisans the knowledge and skills to venture beyond their normalized activities. Some artisans, like Parmigianino and Domenico Beccafumi, experimented with alchemical processes in their art-making [Laboratories of Art, pages 80-81](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=80).

4. <strong>Epistemic Exchanges</strong>:
   Artisanal workshops were not just places for producing objects; they also became centers of intellectual exchange. In Florence, for instance, workshops contributed to the intellectual life of Renaissance courts by blending natural philosophy with artisanal knowledge. This allowed for innovations in areas like metallurgy, glassmaking, and ceramics, blending practical expertise with scholarly inquiry [Laboratories of Art, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17).

These insights demonstrate how the workshop culture of the Renaissance fostered a deep connection between material production and the development of early scientific thought.

On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=93\nPages: 93,94\nBiringuccio\u2019s original approach to the arts of fire emerges and that distinguishes\nhim, for instance, from Georg Agricola who, at almost the same time, wrote his De\nre metallica in which he outlined the general arts of metals related to mining and\nmetallurgy.

Although it is anachronistic to speak of chemistry as a discipline, during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth\ncenturies it is possible to outline an area of interest around the transformation\nprocesses of substances in which various fields of theoretical and practical knowledge intersect. In this cultural context the figures of Leonardo da Vinci and\nVannoccio Biringuccio stand out as, in addition to their experimental activity,\nthey became the promoters of a general reform of chemical arts and natural\nphilosophy.\n\u2018Chemical\u2019 Arts During the Renaissance\nTalking about chemistry in relation to the Renaissance calls for historiographical]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=146\nPages: 146\nadministration of artistic and scientific activities in order to produce characteristic\nobjects he used as tributes to consolidate his politic alliances.\nThe cohabitation between arts and sciences still corresponded to the ancient\nway: in the Renaissance, according to the philosophers and the theologians, arts and\nsciences both belonged to natural philosophy.

In the Pirotechnia (Fig. 9), we again find the two traditional contradictory\nopinions on alchemy: negative towards the alchemists who hide their art behind\nesotericism, magic, alchemical authority and those who practice chemical process\nwithout ratio and empirical control, and positive in relation to the improvement of\nmankind:\nHow many alchemists have I heard lamenting, one because by some unfortunate chance he\nhad spilled his whole composition in the ashes; another because he had been deceived by\nthe excessive strength of the fire, so that the substance of his materials had been burned and\nthe spirits inadvertently allowed to escape; and yet another because he had poor and feeble]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=80\nPages: 80\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of\ndamaged swords and other craft objects.17 Further evidence of artists\u2019 versatile\nactivities during the Renaissance can be found in Andrea Verrocchio\u2019s (1435\u2013\n1488) workshop, which specialized in painting, sculpture, casting and metal carpentry. One of the most important works created in this workshop when Leonardo\nwas still one of Verrocchio\u2019s assistants was the copper sphere on the top of the\nlantern on Filippo Brunelleschi\u2019s (1377\u20131446) dome.18 In Verrocchio\u2019s workshop,\nassistants and pupils, including Leonardo, prepared colors, glues, solvents, waxes,\nacids, alloys and so on.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s engagement with alchemy played a significant role in both his artistic and philosophical practices. His work reflects a deep involvement with the &quot;chemical arts,&quot; especially through his detailed notes and drawings concerning material transformation, fire, and metallurgical processes. Below are key aspects of Leonardo’s connection to alchemy, drawn from the document:

### 1. <strong>Leonardo&#x27;s Skepticism and Engagement with Alchemy</strong>:
   Leonardo took a cautious approach to alchemy, distinguishing between true and false alchemy. He was critical of its claims to transmute base metals into gold, aligning with thinkers like Avicenna, who argued that humans lacked the necessary precision to reproduce nature&#x27;s processes. Leonardo’s skepticism about alchemy’s grandiose claims did not prevent him from engaging with its practical methods for material transformation [Laboratories of Art, pages 83-84](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He argued that the inability of alchemy to deliver its claims of transmutation is due to the impossibility of developing a technology able to reproduce the natural genesis of substantial forms.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

### 2. <strong>Alchemy in Artistic Practice</strong>:
   Leonardo applied alchemical processes in his artistic works, particularly in his large-scale projects involving metallurgy, like the *Equestrian Monument for Francesco Sforza*. This unfinished project required an intricate understanding of bronze casting, a practice deeply connected with alchemical principles of material transformation. His extensive notes and sketches on smelting furnaces, alembics, and heating systems reflect his practical involvement with these processes [Laboratories of Art, pages 81-82](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=81).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo’s manuscripts are one of the best sources to study the chemical equipment of the Renaissance... His project of the Equestrian monument for Francesco Sforza... was a very large bronze statue that was never cast.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, pages 83-84](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

### 3. <strong>Philosophical Contributions</strong>:
   Leonardo was not just a practitioner but also a philosopher of material processes. He explored the transformation of substances in relation to natural philosophy, merging empirical experimentation with theoretical exploration. Leonardo’s involvement with the &quot;chemical arts&quot; extended beyond his artistic and engineering work to philosophical inquiries about matter, nature, and transformation. He considered alchemy as part of the broader inquiry into understanding nature&#x27;s laws [Laboratories of Art, page 92](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;This art [alchemy] is the origin and foundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 92](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92).

Leonardo’s blending of alchemical thought with his mechanical arts and natural philosophy exemplifies the Renaissance approach to knowledge, where practical experimentation and scholarly inquiry were closely intertwined.

</div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s engagement with alchemy extended beyond practical experimentation to a profound philosophical inquiry into the nature of matter and transformation. Here are key aspects of his philosophical contributions to alchemy and natural philosophy:

### 1. <strong>Separation of True and False Alchemy</strong>:
   Leonardo aligned with the ideas of Avicenna, who distinguished between true alchemy grounded in natural philosophy and false alchemy aimed at the transmutation of base metals into gold. Leonardo viewed alchemy with skepticism, recognizing that human technology lacked the precision to replicate nature&#x27;s ability to transform substances. This skepticism informed his broader view of alchemical processes as a tool for understanding natural phenomena, rather than pursuing material gain through transmutation. His focus was on using empirical observation and experimentation to gain knowledge of nature [Laboratories of Art, page 83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He argued that the inability of alchemy to deliver its claims of transmutation is due to the impossibility of developing a technology able to reproduce the natural genesis of substantial forms.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

### 2. <strong>Alchemy as a Study of Material Transformation</strong>:
   Leonardo saw alchemy as part of a broader inquiry into the transformation of matter. His detailed sketches of furnaces, alembics, and other alchemical apparatuses reflect his involvement in understanding how fire, heat, and other forces could change the properties of substances. This was not only a practical concern in his artistic works, such as bronze casting, but also a philosophical investigation into the elements and their transformations. He explored how these changes could offer insights into natural forces, such as the power of fire or water, as fundamental forces in both technology and the natural world [Laboratories of Art, page 87](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=87).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo’s goals are both technological and scientific; the fire works as a drill... This could assume a more general scientific and philosophical explanation because the power of fire manifests itself in the form of a spiral—the natural screw.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 87](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=87).

### 3. <strong>Alchemy as a Foundation for Other Arts</strong>:
   Like his contemporary Vannoccio Biringuccio, Leonardo believed that alchemy, when understood correctly, was the foundation for many other arts, particularly those related to the manipulation of matter, such as metallurgy and glassmaking. Alchemy offered a way to explore the fundamental processes of nature and apply them in artistic and technological innovations. He distanced himself from mystical aspects of alchemy, focusing instead on its empirical and experimental aspects, which could lead to new discoveries and inventions [Laboratories of Art, page 92](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92).

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;This art [alchemy] is the origin and foundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 92](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92).

These insights into Leonardo&#x27;s philosophical engagement with alchemy show how he used it as a tool for exploring natural processes, separating it from mystical or speculative practices. Would you like to explore more on specific applications or further aspects of his philosophical work?</div>

Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83\nPages: 83\nof mortals have their existence and their death.25\nHe argued that the inability of alchemy to deliver its claims of transmutation is\ndue to the impossibility of developing a technology able to reproduce the natural\ngenesis of substantial forms. As Avicenna had already claimed in his Latin translation of Kitab ash-Shifa\u2019 (De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum), Leonardo\nstressed man\u2019s perception of the purity of natural elements was neither highly\ndeveloped nor sensitive enough to be able to precisely quantify the proportions\nrequired to produce the substantial form of different metals.26\nIf we assume within the tradition of Italian \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 this \u2018epistemological approach\u2019 was oriented to separate true and false alchemy and culminated in the\nwork of Biringuccio, then the manuscripts of Leonardo could be seen as one of the\nmain sources of \u2018chemical technologies\u2019 from the end of fifteenth and beginning of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=81\nPages: 81,82\nGombrich, \u201cLeonardo and the Magicians\u201d; Vasoli, Leonardo e l\u2019alchimia, 69\u201377; Kiang,\n\u201cLeonardo and Alchemy\u201d; Frosini, \u201cPittura come filosofia\u201d; Kemp, Leonardo da Vinci, 293\u2013\n329; Galluzzi, \u201cVinci\u2019s Concept of \u2018Nature\u2019,\u201d; Beretta, \u201cLeonardo and Lucretius\u201d; Bernardoni,\n\u201cElementi, sostanze naturali\u201d; and Nanni, \u201cLucrezio.\u201d For Leonardo\u2019s involvement in the chemical arts, see Schneider, Chemische Wissen Leonardo, 40\u20133, 87\u201392; Partington, History of Chemistry, vol.

In this cultural context the figures of Leonardo da Vinci and\nVannoccio Biringuccio stand out as, in addition to their experimental activity,\nthey became the promoters of a general reform of chemical arts and natural\nphilosophy.\n\u2018Chemical\u2019 Arts During the Renaissance\nTalking about chemistry in relation to the Renaissance calls for historiographical]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=90\nPages: 90,91\n35\nLeonardo, Manuscript B, 19 [fol. 10v, IV].\n68\nA.

One of the most important works created in this workshop when Leonardo\nwas still one of Verrocchio\u2019s assistants was the copper sphere on the top of the\nlantern on Filippo Brunelleschi\u2019s (1377\u20131446) dome.18 In Verrocchio\u2019s workshop,\nassistants and pupils, including Leonardo, prepared colors, glues, solvents, waxes,\nacids, alloys and so on. Being an artist in the Renaissance meant being part of a\nwider shared material culture as artisans and chymists used and developed the same\nmaterials and techniques.\nIn Biringuccio\u2019s book we find a description of a brass-making workshop he\nvisited in Milan that discusses the organization of the workshop and the artisans\u2019]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=87\nPages: 87\ndrilling motion of fire. Leonardo\u2019s goals are both technological and scientific; the\nfire works as a drill. If this were to be verified, it could be used in some technological application but it could also assume a more general scientific and philosophical\nexplanation because the power of fire, like the power of the other elements (water,\nair and earth), manifests itself in the form of a spiral\u2014the natural screw. The power\nof the screw could be seen in the vortices of water and air, but also in Brunelleschi\u2019s\nbigger cranes and powerful technological elevator devices that become an analogic\nexplanation for the forces operating in nature.32\nAnother very interesting case involving the chemical equipment studied by\nLeonardo is the development of the alembic refrigerator system.

Leonardo\u2019s atoms do not have qualitative-chemical\nspecifications but they have to be interpreted as physical primary matter particles\nexisting in nature without any chemical or physical properties. They are the result\nof substance consumption and we can see them in the form of dust, smoke, or as\ntiny, undefined pieces of matter:\nThe air that successively surrounds a moving object moving through it makes various\nmotions within itself. This can be seen in the dust particles [attimi] found in the sphere of\nthe sun, when they penetrate through some window into an obscure location, and when a\nstone is thrown into these dust particles [attimi], along the length of this solar ray, you can\nsee the dust particles [attimi] turning about at that location where the path made by the\nmoving object was filled in again by the air, as has been proved in the fifth.38\nAnd again:]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=84\nPages: 84\nFrancesco Sforza. This was a very large bronze statue that was never cast but\nstudied and worked on by Leonardo for almost 20 years. The main difficulty of this\ncast was the size, more than 7 m tall and almost 70 tons in weight, and the plan to\nrealize it in a single pouring.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s exploration of material transformation was a cornerstone of his engagement with the alchemical and chemical arts. His detailed studies, notes, and experiments reflected a deep interest in how natural forces, especially fire, could transform substances. This exploration played a role in both his technological innovations and philosophical inquiries.

### Key Aspects of Leonardo’s Study of Material Transformation:

1. <strong>Fire as a Transformative Force</strong>:
   Leonardo viewed fire as a fundamental element in the transformation of matter, especially in metallurgical processes. His notes and sketches frequently explore the use of fire in smelting, casting, and other processes, seeing fire as both a practical tool and a subject of philosophical contemplation. In his studies, fire was described as a &quot;drilling force,&quot; capable of altering matter in ways that could be applied to technological innovations, such as the use of spirals or screws in both natural and artificial systems. He sought to connect these natural transformations with human technology, applying them to his work in metallurgy and beyond.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo’s goals are both technological and scientific; the fire works as a drill... This could assume a more general scientific and philosophical explanation because the power of fire manifests itself in the form of a spiral—the natural screw.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 87](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=87).

2. <strong>The Study of Bronze Casting</strong>:
   One of Leonardo’s most ambitious projects was the *Equestrian Monument for Francesco Sforza*, a large bronze statue planned to be cast in a single pour. The project, though never completed, pushed Leonardo to study the physical and chemical properties of materials, particularly metals, in great depth. He experimented with furnaces and casting techniques, studying how fire, sand, wax, gypsum, and other materials reacted during the molding and casting process. These investigations were essential to his work on large-scale bronze castings and demonstrated his commitment to understanding material transformation at both the practical and theoretical levels.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo studied artillery casting, furnaces and the materials used in the molding, like sand, wax, gypsum, clay, brick powder, carrying out several experiments to better understand their chemical-physical properties.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, pages 83-84](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83).

3. <strong>Alembics and Refrigeration Systems</strong>:
   Leonardo also studied alembics and refrigeration systems as part of his exploration into chemical transformations. He developed ideas for an alembic lid with a water chamber for cooling, a modern approach for preventing thermal shock during distillation processes. These experiments reflect his broad understanding of material science and his desire to innovate within the field of alchemical apparatus.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo also developed an alembic lid with a chamber along its external surface where fresh water could flow... Scholars had already discussed this very modern solution.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 88](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=88).

4. <strong>Atoms and Material Reduction</strong>:
   Leonardo explored the concept of particles and atoms in relation to material transformation, noting how small particles could be observed during transformations, such as dust or smoke. His observations of how fire and other elements reduced substances to these primary particles were both scientific and philosophical, as he sought to understand the underlying structure of matter and its transformation.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The air that successively surrounds a moving object... makes various motions within itself... This can be seen in the dust particles found in the sphere of the sun.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 91](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=91).

Leonardo’s work in material transformation bridged the practical and philosophical, connecting the transformation of matter with broader natural laws and technological applications. Let me know if you&#x27;d like to explore further aspects of his work or other related topics!</div>

The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

At the time of Biringuccio\u2019s writing, the potter\u2019s art was on the threshold of a\nparadigm shift that would create a marked division between craft knowledge and\ntheory based practice, setting two separate courses for ceramic innovation in the\nlater sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance. The medieval technological debate during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries went beyond the traditional Quaestio de alchimia]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13\nPages: 13\nusing materials and chemical procedures to make both everyday items and objects\nof the visual and decorative arts, the activity known as alchemy encompassed more\nthan attempts to make gold.14 Transmutational alchemy was about the transmutation of all base metals into more noble ones, but chrysopoeia was only one\naspect of alchemy. Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture.\nIt was about the chemical production of things\u2014medicines, porcelain, dyes, and\nother products as well as the precious metals\u2014and about the knowledge of how to\nproduce them. In this sense, \u201cart technologies\u201d\u2014materials and techniques to make\nart and knowledge of these materials and techniques\u2014overlapped with alchemy.\nAlchemy has deep roots in writings on material transformation from Antiquity.\nThe productive knowledge associated with material transformation was written\ndown in recipe books.

In the Studiolo the connection between alchemy\nand the chemical arts was exalted. The iconographic itinerary conceived by\nBorghini was situated in a sequence on the upper part of the wall where paintings\ndevoted to thermal baths, the discovery of gun powder, a glass works, a goldsmith\u2019s\nworkshop, alchemists and a bronze foundry were located; at the room\u2019s two ends\nwere two statues, portraying Vulcan and Apollo. On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=154\nPages: 154\na city \u201cfounded upon the guilds and trade.\u201d17\nThis new configuration of professional relations led to a thorough reassessment\nof the locations where cultural and economic activities were conducted, articulating\nin an experimental key the arts, which previously had been regarded as the fruit of\nindividual dexterity rather than the outcome of a deliberate cultural program. In\nmany cases the architectural changes were not apparent, since many kinds of\nartisans (e.g., the goldsmiths) kept on using the same premises they had occupied\nfor generations. However, even in such examples of apparent continuity the arts\nwere seen as vectors for change. This perception found visual expression in a\nvolume of engravings, based on drawings by Jan van der Straet (1523\u20131605)\n(or Giovanni Stradano), that bore the significant title Nova Reperta, commissioned\nby the Florentine academician Luigi Alamanni (1558\u20131603) around the end of the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=146\nPages: 146\nadministration of artistic and scientific activities in order to produce characteristic\nobjects he used as tributes to consolidate his politic alliances.\nThe cohabitation between arts and sciences still corresponded to the ancient\nway: in the Renaissance, according to the philosophers and the theologians, arts and\nsciences both belonged to natural philosophy. Besides, botany and medicine\nbecame part of the symbolic network formed around the ideal prince\u2019s image: the\ndoctor and philosopher prince acting for his people\u2019s health and salvation. This\nimage took on a special aura under Ferdinando I, who dealt in large-scale sacred\nimages with curing powers, like the Miraculous Virgin of Santissima Annunziata or\nthe Madonna of Loreto, and medicine.\nDestined to further dynastic and political propaganda, arts and sciences had to\nreflect grand-ducal power. Therefore, the Galleria dei lavori preserved through\nsecrecy the most progressive techniques, developed a widely recognizable style for\n55]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=157\nPages: 157\nthe chemical arts was visually displayed in the series of paintings hanging in the\nStudiolo of Palazzo Vecchio, a small dark room decorated with a complex iconographic narrative. Designed for the then Prince Francesco by Vincenzo Borghini\n(1515\u20131580) and Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), its cabinets seem to have included\nsome of the most valuable treasures produced in the fonderia. In addition to all sorts\nof precious stones, glass and porcelain, they carefully stored the rarest natural\nspecimens and the products of alchemical experiments.26 The meaning of this\nroom and its intimate connection with Francesco I\u2019s interest in alchemy, has been\ndiscussed by many, and most recently reconstructed in the comprehensive work by\nValentina Conticelli. Thirty-two artists were employed and coordinated by Vasari\nto accomplish the work.

Although\nZosimus stresses the central role played by dyeing techniques, the polarity between\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n17\na wider idea of alchemy and the bare making of precious metals seems to have been\nreduced to a simpler discussion on metalworking: Zosimus underscores all the\npossible chromatic transformations of metals, which seem to become the most\nrelevant topic of any alchemical inquiry.\nSuch a variety of positions already detectable during the earliest phases of the\nwestern alchemical tradition makes clear how fluid were the boundaries of an art]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26,27\n2\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n3\nThe passage comes after a long introduction (\u00a7\u00a7 1\u20134) in which Psellos rhetorically\ndiscusses the philosophical framework within which chrysopoeia is to be understood and assessed. At the very beginning (\u00a7 1, ll. 5f.) the scholar identifies the main\ntopic of his letter with \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (the art of fire), whose first aim is said to be\nthe transformation of lead, tin, and any other metal into gold (\u00a7 1, ll. 12\u201315). The\nkey concept of transformation is framed and expanded in the following paragraphs\n(\u00a7\u00a7 2\u20134), where Psellos tries to set the basic principles guiding his \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2\n(scientific) explanation of this art.

These\nobjects were all products of the arts of fire, which according to Vannoccio\nBiringuccio (1480\u2013c.1539) included alchemy, and excluded \u201cfalse alchemy\u201d\nconcerned with pretentious transmutation.2\nIn the background of Van Utrecht\u2019s painting, a window opens on to a space in\nwhich a man stands working at a stove with an open fire.

Trained artisans\nwould then be sent out to distribute new processes, new manufactures and inventions. Becher used alchemy to intrigue his patron, who was always interested in the\nwealth promised by metallic transmutation, and to link the worlds of the court and\ncommerce.\nSuch court projects often took inspiration from the two earliest examples of\nspaces bringing together alchemy and the decorative arts at the Medici court in\nFlorence. Two essays in this volume deal with these Florentine workplaces: Fanny\nKieffer discusses the Uffizi, and Marco Beretta the Casino di San Marco. Founded\nin 1586 by Francesco I de\u2019 Medici (1541\u20131587), and developed by his successor,\nFerdinando I (1549\u20131609), the Uffizi housed the fonderia, a workspace for the arts\nof fire. Here medicines were prepared and metals fused. The fonderia was simultaneously a pharmacy, an alchemical laboratory, a smithy, a goldsmith\u2019s workshop,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16\nBeretta, were also early examples of such places of exchange, followed by many\nother European courts. These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search\nfor the perfecting of base material substances and also for the extending of life.3\nThe theoretical and practical aspects of alchemy involve both the study of all\ninanimate or animate things made from the elements and the observation and\nimitation of natural processes within the laboratory.4 In this context, alchemy\ncould be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also\na liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its transformation.5 In the practical sense, one of the main goals of alchemy is the transmutation\n1\nThe main data and characteristics of these manuscripts are given in Appendix.\nBrewer, Fr.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Alchemy was seen as a foundational practice for many other arts during the Renaissance, particularly through its focus on material transformation. The processes developed in alchemy had significant overlaps with the arts of fire, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and ceramics. Here are key points illustrating how alchemy served as a foundation for these crafts:

### 1. <strong>Alchemy as the Origin of Many Arts</strong>:
   Alchemy was seen not just as an esoteric practice but as the root of many artisanal crafts. Alchemical procedures, which relied on understanding material transformations, were essential to various industries that involved manipulating matter, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and dye production. The knowledge alchemists developed about chemical reactions, furnaces, and the purification of substances directly informed these crafts.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Thus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art [alchemy] is the origin and foundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 92](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92).

### 2. <strong>Interconnectedness of Arts and Alchemy in Renaissance Workshops</strong>:
   Renaissance workshops were often places where alchemy and the chemical arts overlapped. For instance, in the fonderia (a workshop dedicated to the arts of fire), artisans engaged in activities such as the casting of metals, preparation of pigments, and production of glass. These workshops provided a space for experimentation with the transformation of matter, where alchemy directly contributed to innovations in art technologies.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy played an exceedingly important role... as a useful set of experimental practices in which several crafts helped artisans quench their thirst for innovation.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 156](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=156).

### 3. <strong>Alchemy as a Tool for Artisans</strong>:
   Alchemical knowledge was used by artisans to elevate their craft, as they adopted alchemical language and techniques to develop new materials and methods. For instance, glassmakers and metallurgists relied on alchemical processes to refine metals or create new types of glass. This blending of artisanal skill and alchemical knowledge allowed for innovations that shaped the production of decorative arts and functional objects.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials between alchemy and the arts... the boundaries between alchemy and art technologies were fluid.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16).

### 4. <strong>Artisanal Innovation Through Alchemy</strong>:
   Alchemy provided a framework for understanding how to manipulate materials and experiment with new forms of production. Artisans working with porcelain, glass, and other materials would use alchemical methods to refine their craft, contributing to significant advancements in material science. This knowledge was often disseminated through recipe books, combining both alchemical and artisanal instructions.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;It [alchemy] was about the chemical production of things—medicines, porcelain, dyes, and other products as well as precious metals—and about the knowledge of how to produce them.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 13](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13).

Alchemy’s role as a foundation for other arts lies in its practical application to material transformation, making it a crucial contributor to the development of techniques in metallurgy, glassmaking, and other crafts.

As we have already pointed out, artisans used similar\nequipment and performed \u201cchemical\u201d operations. However, Bernardoni argues,\nBiringuccio made the claim that these artisans were the true experts on matter,\nmaterials and material transformation and that artisanal \u201cchemical\u201d operations were\nthe key to natural knowledge.\nOne of the readers of Biringuccio\u2019s Pirotechnia was Johannes Mathesius (1504\u2013\n1565), a Lutheran preacher in St. Joachimsthal, the center of an important mining\ndistrict.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s study of alembics, a key instrument used in distillation processes, showcases his engagement with material transformation and the &quot;chemical arts.&quot; Here are the key insights from his work:

1. <strong>Use of Glass Alembics for Observation</strong>:
   Leonardo preferred using glass alembics in his experiments because they allowed him to visually observe the condensation processes within the vessel. This transparency was crucial for studying how smoke and vapor condensed inside the alembic, offering insights into the behavior of materials under heat and pressure. Leonardo&#x27;s fascination with the visibility of chemical reactions reflects his broader approach to studying nature by direct observation.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Leonardo, in fact, preferred using glass alembics because of the possibility of observing condensation phenomena inside them.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 89](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=89).

2. <strong>Innovations in Alembic Design</strong>:
   One of Leonardo’s significant contributions was the design of a refrigerated alembic, which included an external water chamber for cooling. This advanced design aimed to prevent thermal shock in the neck of the alembic during the distillation process. His drawings from the *Codex Atlanticus* illustrate how he combined practical engineering with chemical experimentation, creating a modern solution to a common problem in distillation.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;For the refrigerator system, Leonardo also developed an alembic lid with a chamber along its external surface where fresh water could flow inside.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 88](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=88).

3. <strong>Technological Focus in Alembics</strong>:
   Leonardo&#x27;s study of alembics extended to the material composition and production techniques for creating the vessels. In one study, he described how to create an alembic by first building a wooden model, refining it with clay and wool, and casting the final product in copper or glass. This meticulous attention to the construction process highlights Leonardo’s focus on both the functionality and craftsmanship of chemical equipment.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;First of all, writes Leonardo, the model of the alembic in turned wood has to be built, and then it has to be refined with clay wool-cloth clippings.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 88](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=88).

4. <strong>Application of Alembics in Broader Studies</strong>:
   Beyond distillation, Leonardo used alembics as part of his broader exploration of natural phenomena, including the movement of air and water. For example, he designed transparent vessels to study how water flowed and how smoke condensed. These studies reflect his constant search for empirical data through observation, further bridging his scientific curiosity with alchemical and artistic processes.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;We also find a transparent glass cylinder for studying the flame of a candle... and most of all, the drawing of a glass-drinking horn with which Leonardo says he is able to observe free atoms moved by the water.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 90](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=90).

Leonardo&#x27;s work with alembics is an excellent example of his blend of empirical investigation and mechanical ingenuity. His designs aimed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of alchemical processes, contributing to the broader understanding of material transformation.

Its interior is an artificial world assembled from different ores\nwhere the anonymous artist depicted Adam and Eve at the moment of the Fall,\nsurrounded by contemporary miners hewing stone and digging for metal using\nvarious procedures. A typical Kunstkammer object of the sixteenth century, in\nwhich the appreciation of rare, precious materials is joined by delight in human\nvirtuosity and invention, the coconut translates montanistic topics and metallurgical\nlore into material form. This achievement is discussed within the context of natural\nphilosophical theories concerning the causes and the creation of metal in early\nmodern times with the aim of reconstructing the common Diskursrahmen and\nVorstellungshorizont, in which mining professionals, as well as alchemists and\ngoldsmiths worked and in which they localized their practices and self-conception.\nThe mining city St. Joachimsthal in the Erzgebirge is introduced as a space where\npractitioners and scholars worked side by side. Here natural philosophical conceptions were mediated to artisans and craftsmen and empirical know-how and knowledge of materials was conveyed to academics.\nHow much natural philosophical knowledge and how many alchemical concepts\nare encapsulated in a sixteenth-century Kunstkammer object? And how did goldsmiths come in contact with these ideas: from whom, mediated through which\nsources and in which setting? Might the goldsmiths have been involved in the\ndevelopment and dissemination of these theories? When goldsmiths loaded an\nobject with references to natural philosophical discourse what was the motivation,\nthe context, and who was the audience?\nH.

Haug\nThe first part of this article attempts to answer these questions in relation to\nmetallogenetic ideas by introducing diverse conceptions of the formation and origin\nof ore deposits.1 These contemporary explanations of the creation of metals help\nexplain why knowledge of metals and minerals could affect the working process of\nboth the alchemist and the goldsmith. The goldsmiths\u2019 craft knowledge\u2014as well as\nthe information gathered by professionals in the mining districts of the Erzgebirge\n(Ore Mountains), Harz and other regions through the methods of observation, of\ncollecting and of categorization\u2014was incorporated into scientific treatises on the\nformation of metals and helped to change and develop this domain. The artisan\u2019s\ncraft knowledge about matter and materials rarely found its way into a written form.\nIt was most commonly expressed in its suitable mode, the accomplished work of\nart.2\nThe second part of the article analyses the materials and shape of a coconut\nvessel on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Fig. 1) to see if the\naforementioned metallogenetical theories could have had an impact on the form of\na sixteenth-century art object: in this Kunstkammer object an unknown goldsmith\nfrom the Erzgebirge created a mountainous landscape, simultaneously a representation of paradise with Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge and the\ndepiction of a post-expulsion mining area populated by contemporary miners. This\nstudy suggests some of the possible messages the anonymous goldsmith formulated\nfor the owner and beholder, who was presumably interested in obtaining objects\nwith natural philosophical content for his collection.\nA mediator between the metallogenetical research and the goldsmith\u2019s artificium\nis present in the person of the St. Joachimthaler preacher, historiographer, and\nminerals collector Johannes Mathesius (1504\u20131565). He was an eminent figure in\nthe circulation of alchemical and metallurgical knowledge; through his work it can\nbe seen how this specific codified knowledge was applied and how it could become\na common good in montanistic centres and mining areas.\nMetallogenetical Concepts\nMany theories on the formation of metal were exhaustively compiled in\nMathesius\u2019s \u201cDie Dritte Predigt. Von Ursprung zu und abnemen der metallen\nunnd Minerischen bergkarten und Ertzen\u201d (Third Sermon. On the Origin, Growing\nand Reduction of Metals and Minerals and Ores) (Hereafter Third Sermon).3\nMathesius published his sermon collection Sarepta oder Bergpostil in Nuremberg\nin 1562. In these texts he incorporated all his accumulated empirical knowledge\nabout mining and minerals (based on his famous collection) enriched by his vast\n1\nAdams, \u201cOrigin\u201d; and Suhing, \u201cPhilosophisches.\u201d\nFor the concept of \u2018craft knowledge\u2019, see Smith, Body of the Artisan.\n3\nFor Mathesius, see Dufek, \u201cMathesius\u201d; and Loesche, \u201cMathesius.\u201d\n2\n\nPages 104:\nArtificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things: Shared. . .\n81\nFig. 1 KokosnussDoppelscheuer (coconut\nvessel), closed, sixteenth\ncentury St. Joachimsthal\n(?).

In the \u201cThird Sermon\u201d, held in 1555,\nMathesius discusses the emergence of ore deposits and combines several, to some\nextent competing, early modern metallogenetical theories in one narration for his\nparishioners, that is, mining professionals from the famous city of the bohemian\nErzgebirge, St. Joachimsthal.4 Mathesius preaches:\n[. . .] about your metals or, as you call them, about certain Bergarten and ores and from their\nnames, nature, and characters and how and through and from what they were created in\n4\nMathesius, Sarepta, fol. 38r\u201357r; Fischer, Bergm\u20ac\nannisches (1969), and Bergm\u20ac\nannisches (1970).\n\nPages 105:\n82\nH. Haug\ntheir seams, lodes and layers and how one metal can be transformed into another until the\ngood metal [is achieved], massive and completely. And how the spare metal again through\nnatural heat is reduced and consumed, as the holy scripture and honest and experienced\nminers testify and I myself have seen and learned and is tolerable for and suited in the\nchurch, and I will give report in plain and good montanistic words, to identify and praise in\nit God\u2019s hand and creation.5\nMathesius\u2019s clearly formulated aim is the recognition of God in his opus (natural\ntheology), more specifically, as he is speaking to the mining professionals of\nthe Erzgebirge, the recognition of God in one of his marvellous gifts: metal.\nWhat follows however is not a simple sermon appropriate for the church, but rather\na scientific lecture in which Mathesius presents and discusses different\nmetallogenetical positions of his time.6\nMathesius starts by comparing God\u2019s formative acts with the practice of the\nhuman artisan, who imitates nature in his workshop with the substances available to\nhim, stating \u201cGod has various schmeltzwerck [products produced by melting/fusion/\ncasting] in his laboratorio [workshop] and smelts the metals as beautifully and in as\nmany colours as the flowers in the field or the crests of a stonecutter.\u201d7 God is\npersonified as some kind of metalworker, maybe a goldsmith in his workshop, who\nuses a smelting process to form the several metals that can be found in the earth.\nAnd Mathesius doesn\u2019t leave any doubts that this is a perpetual process when he\nexplains:\nThe experience of every day shows\u2014aside from scholarly reports\u2014that our God daily\ncreates and lets grow in the earth all kinds of noble and rough stones as well as the various\nprecious and salubrious bergsafften [juices of the mountain] and various bergarten [minerals], ores and pure metals.8\n5\n\u201cvon ewern metallen oder wi ir pflegt zu reden von allerley bergarten unnd ertzen unnd von iren\nnamen, natur unnd eygenschafft und wie und warau\u00df und wardurch sie in iren gengen, fletzen und\nsto\u0308cken gewircket unnd wie ein bergart in die ander verwandheit bi\u00df die gu\u0308ltigen metal, gedigen\nund vollstendig und wie die uberstendigen metal wider durch natu\u0308rliche hitz inn der erden\nabnemen unnd verzert werden, so viel mich die heylige schrifft und ehrliche und erfarne bergleut\nberichtet und ich selbs gesehen und gemerckt habe und sich in der kirchen leyden unnd gezimmen\nwil unnd di\u00df alles euch einfeltig und mit guten bergkleufftigen worten berichten, doch das hierinn\nvornemlich Gottes hand und werck geru\u0308hmet und erkannt werde.\u201d (\u201cDie Dritte Predigt.

Are there one or more primary matters?\nHow and under what conditions do these primordial materials transmute into the\ndifferent metallic substances? And last but not least: what causes this process?\nMathesius and his \u201cThird Sermon\u201d is not a randomly chosen source. The author\nstood in the centre of scholarly culture in St. Joachimsthal, in one of the most\nimportant centres of the Renaissance mining industry and he was an important link\nin the vibrant network of many protagonists involved in mineralogical and metallurgical research. Mathesius was a friend and interlocutor of Georg Agricola (1494\u2013\n1555), one of the eminent representatives of early modern metallurgy, and was\nfamiliar with his writings as well as with older German metallurgical literature. He\nread both Ulrich Ru\u0308lein of Calw\u2019s (1465\u20131523) Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein published in 1505\nand the more modern De la pirotechnia by Vanoccio Biringuccio (1480\u2013c.1537)\nfrom 1540.10 He was a well-known collector of minerals and well connected in the\nintellectual world of St. Joachimsthal. Furthermore, as a student and dining partner\nof Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) he operated in Protestant humanist circles: in short\nan authority par excellence for all themes concerning montanist mindscapes of the\nsixteenth century.\nMathesius\u2019s texts interweave preaching and scientific imagination and thus attest\nto how strongly early modern natural philosophy and metallurgic research are\ninfluenced by the Christian episteme:\nBut my undertaking shall conduct to that effect, to show to you, my parishioners, the\nalmighty and wonderful hand of God and his immeasurable abundance and his inscrutable\nwisdom and his merciful and fatherly heart in his creation and revelation of all kinds of\nminerals and metals, to make you recognize your God in his gifts and teach you to praise\nhim, which he conveys to you in this mountain in clement benevolence.11\nThis juxtaposition of empirical knowledge based on experience next to philosophical and theological reflections of the causes of things is typical for Mathesius\nand many other writers of the sixteenth century, as they interpret their increasing\n9\nThis concept can be found in medieval authors writing on natura as goddess, as pro-dea and as\nvicaria (assistant) of God, who was entrusted with the creatio continua, the continuous creations as\npro-creatrix, like Alanus ab Insulis or Jean de Meuns in his roman de la rose. See Modersohn,\nNatura als Gottin.\n10\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia [1540], and Pirotechnia (1942).\n11\n\u201cMein vornehmen aber sol sich eygentlich dahin lenden, das ich euch meinen Pfarrkindern\nvornehmlich die allmechtige und wunderbarliche hand Gottes und seinen unme\u00dflichen reychtumb\nneben seiner unerforschlichen wey\u00dfheyt unnd genedigen unnd Va\u0308terlichen hertzen inn Scho\u0308pffung\nund offenbarung allerley ertz unnd metalle zeyge, damit ir ewern Got in seinen gaben erkennen\nund preysen lernet, die er euch inn diesem gebirge auf genediger gu\u0308te mittheylet.\u201d (\u201cDie Dritte\nPredigt.

Haug\nempirical knowledge within the limits of a regular and harmonic world, where\neverything points back to its origin, i.e. God.\nMathesius and other mineralogists of the sixteenth century could only rely on a\nfew preliminary works when they made their speculations on the Metallogenese, as\nAgricola regrets in the introduction to his De ortu et causis subterraneorum from\n1546:\nThe Greeks and Latins, however, who we see working for more than a thousand years to\nincrease scientific knowledge, all of them only interpreted the writings of Plato and\nAristotle and followed their views; they neither made inquiries about unsolved questions\nnor did they treat them scientifically. When our Albertus started to make observations about\nthe genesis of excavated materials, he blended the teachings of philosophers, astrologers\nand chymists into one.12\nTwo important preliminary writings, Aristotle\u2019s reflections on meteorology and\nAlbertus Magnus\u2019s (1193\u20131280) Libri cinque de mineralibus et rebus metallicis,\nare considered by Agricola and other early modern authors and are present in\nalmost all theories of the sixteenth century. With Albertus\u2019s De mineralibus an\nimportant testimony to the transmission of antique metallurgic knowledge and its\ncombination with alchemical concepts has been preserved. That Albertus\u2019s knowledge was not out of date in the early modern period is attested by the two prints of\nhis works by Giovanni and Gregorius de Gregoriis in Venice (De mineralibus,\n1495) and of Jacob Ko\u0308bel (Liber mineralium, 1518) in Oppenheim. His amalgamation had a great influence and contributed strongly to the work of several natural\nphilosophers and alchemists of the sixteenth century. It found its way equally into\nalchemical practices as well as the theoretical concepts of \u2018modern\u2019 metallurgists\nand was part of the common knowledge in the workshops of goldsmiths and other\nmetalworkers of the early modern periods. A remark in Aristotle\u2019s treatise lead\nAlbertus to assume that the ancient philosopher had written a follow-up work on\nminerals, stones, earth and metals. It was Albertus\u2019s intention to comment on the\nwhole Aristotle, i.e. to commentate the texts that were in the thirteenth century\nconsidered to be the Aristotelian philosophical works on nature. Therefore it is no\nwonder that he, believing that Aristotle\u2019s treatise was lost, commenced his own\nLapidary (Book of Stone): \u201cWe have not seen Aristotle\u2019s books about these\n[minerals], but only some excerpts from them; and what Avicenna says about\n[minerals] in the third chapter of the first book which he wrote about them is not\nsufficient.\u201d13 Thus, Albertus\u2019s text is an advancement of the Aristotelian systems,\nwhich he blends with alchemical texts and concepts obtained from Arabic sources.\nHe also enriched his text with empirical know how gained on his visits to mining\n12\n\u201cQuos vero tam Graeco, quam Latinos annis plus mille in rerum congitiones versatos videmus,\nomnes ad unum scripta Platonis, aut Aristoteles interpretati sunt, &amp; sententias fecuti: eoque minus\nmultas res nondum, explanatas vocarunt in quaestionem, literisque illustrarunt. Nam Albertus\nnoster aggressus dicere de ortu eorum quae effodiumtur, Philosophorum &amp; Alstrologorum &amp;\nChymistarum decreta in unum confundit.\u201d (Agricola, \u201cGeologie und Mineralogie,\u201d 76, and\nOrtu, 24).\n13\nAlbertus, Book of Minerals, 9.\n\nPages 108:\nArtificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things: Shared. . .\n85\ndistricts as he relates in his Book of Minerals (III, I, I). According to Aristotle, there\nare four causes: the material, the efficient, the formal and the final.14 Albertus\nbegins with the material cause discussing the primary matter from which different\nminerals were created. Naturally Albertus\u2019s chemical understanding is also shaped\nby Aristotle, so he starts with the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. The\ngeneral classification throughout his text on minerals is based on this material\ncause: Albertus starts with a chapter on stones, which he classified as simple\nstructures made from a mixture of earth and water. According to his system, metals\nare more elaborate structures built from sulphur and mercury (quicksilver), which\nthemselves are mixtures of earth and water (quicksilver) and all four elements\n(sulphur). This sulphur-quicksilver theory is non-Aristotelian, but was an adaption\nfrom Arabic writings.\nThe second part of Albertus\u2019s system is built by the efficient causes\u2014the agents\nor operators that cause the creation of minerals and metals from a still non-specific\nprimordial matter: Albertus takes the \u2018two exhalationes theory\u2019 of Aristotle and\nadjusts it a little, by equating dry smoke with sulphur and moist vapour with\nmercury. According to Aristotle there are two kinds of aeroform emanations\nwhich ascend from the middle of the earth to the surface. One of these exhalationes\nis a dry fume which transforms into earth and stones, the other a humid steam,\nwhich condenses into metals:\nWe maintain that there are two exhalations, one vaporous the other smoky, and there\ncorrespond two kinds of bodies that originate in the earth, \u2018fossils\u2019 and metals. The heat of\nthe dry exhalation is the cause of all \u2018fossils\u2019. Such stones cannot be melted [. . .]. The\nvaporous exhalation is the cause of all metals, those bodies which are either fusible or\nmalleable such as iron, copper, gold. All these originate from the imprisonment of the\nvaporous exhalation in the earth, and especially in stones. Their dryness compresses it, and\nit congeals just as dew or hoar-frost does when it has been separated, though in the present\ncase the metals are generated before that segregation occurs. Hence, they are water in a\nsense, and in a sense not [. . .]. Hence, they all (except gold) are affected by fire, and they\npossess an admixture of earth; for they still contain the dry exhalation.15\nTo convert these two exhalationes into ore deposits, Albertus says that they\nmust: first, be confined in the earth; and second, react under the power of two\ninstruments, that is heat and cold. But the transformation from primordial matter\ninto the several metals is not a mere mechanical process, it requires a mineralizing\npower to achieve the destined form.\nHere Albertus merges an alchemical concept with ideas from Aristotle extracted\nfrom his Generation of Animals. He equates a female principle with the material\ncause, i.e. the shapeless matter, subjected to an efficient cause, a forming principle\nthat is inherent in the male semen. To initiate this transformational process Albertus\nintroduces the celestial bodies as impulses. After discussing the material and\nefficient cause he then treats the third, the formal cause, where he follows Aristotle\nwho said that the male principle contributes the form of the offspring, i.e. the\n14\n15\nAlbertus, Book of Minerals, XXXI.\nAristoteles, \u201cMeteorologie,\u201d 136.\n\nPages 109:\n86\nH. Haug\nspecies. Again Albertus turns to the power of the stars that act as formative powers\ndescending from the heavens and which are responsible for the seven known main\nmetals.\nThe structure of the book and the line of his argumentation shows that Albertus\nat one point had to face the question of transmutation: if metals are formed from\nprimordial matter consisting of a mixture of the four elements, i.e. from a mixture of\nsulphur and mercury as substances in between the basic elements and the finished\nmetals, and if metals are constantly emerging as defined species, then this logically\nleads to a discussion of whether one metal can be transformed into another as the\nalchemists claim. Albertus does not totally dismiss the possibility of transmutation,\nbut\u2014as a follower of Aristotle\u2014accepts the theoretical possibility, without showing particular interest in this question, when he states:\nWe do not intend here to show how any one of these may be transmuted into another, or\nhow, by the remedy of that medicine the alchemists call the elixir, their diseases may be\ncured, or their occult properties made manifest, or conversely their manifest properties be\nremoved. But instead we shall show how they are mixed from the elements, and how each\none is constituted in its own specific form.16\nAlbertus, with his system and his reception of ancient philosophical considerations, had a strong influence on the early modern period: he describes properties of\nthe metals like colour, malleability, melting point and so forth as accidental\nproperties of the metals. The ancient and medieval search for the causes and the\nprinciples proceeded to dominate early modern metallogenetic theories. The progeny of these Aristotelean-Albertian concepts are found everywhere in Mathesius,\nwho says about silver:\nMassive or compact silver is the name for what is pure and nearly fine and can be cut and\nembossed, before it is put in the fire. But all massive and particularly all different forms of\nwey\u00df und rotg\u20ac\nuldig ertz [silver ores] and gla\u00df ertz [silver sulfid] wear off in the fire because\nof all the sulphur and the quicksilver and the other impurities that are still in it.17\nThe same with gold: \u201cI have seen gold in an iron-stone, as well as gold in the\nStyria [Steiermark], which changes its golden colour in the fire, when the quicksilver exhales from it, comparable to the goldsmith gilding silver dishes.\u201d18 Both\nquotations show how deeply Mathesius\u2019s understanding is based on the two basic\n16\nAlbertus, Book of Minerals, 10.\n\u201cGedigen oder derb silber heyst, das rein und schier fein ist und das sich schneyden und pregen\nlesset ehe es ins fewer kompt.

Agricola also discusses the\ndivine origins and causes of minerals when he states in De ortu et causis (1546):\nThe philosophers, astrologers and chymists study the ortus et causas [origins and causes] of\nores, because nothing happens without a cause, and they state correctly that even now, as\nbefore, the formation of ores takes place. The less acceptable is the completely ludicrous\nview of the large mass\u2014more a fairy tale, that contradicts all experience\u2014claiming that not\nonly rocks, but also the minerals and gems and different kinds of soil in their burrows,\nchasms and grooves have been formed at the beginning of the world by God, as they are\nnow found, and in the meantime no such things were created or re-created from possible\nsubstances, and the highest [\u00bcdivine] opifex [workman] did not set any sort of natural force\nin motion to ensure their constant generation.19\nAnother important protagonist of early modern mineralogy, the metallurgist,\nM\u20ac\nunzmeister (moneyer) and Probierer (tester) Lazarus Ercker (1528\u20131594) says in\nhis Beschreibung allerf\u20ac\nurnemisten mineralischer Ertzt and Berckwercksarten\n(Description of the Most Distinguished Ores and Minerals), his Gro\u00dfes\nProbierbuch of 1574, that he will not discuss the writings of natural philosophers\non ores and metals, because:\n[their] thoughts and delusions are not only uncertain and often wrong, but frequently\ncontradict themselves [and] I want to simply believe that God, the almighty Creator, has\nreserved these secrets in his omnipotence and he created gold and silver as well as all other\nmetals through his word, through which also originates heaven and earth and everything\nthat is on it and in it.20\nFollowing this argument, Ercker assumes firstly that all metals were once\ncreated at the beginning of time by God, that secondly no genuine natural power\ncontinues to create ores and that, consequently and thirdly, the generation of metals\nand minerals must lie outside human comprehension.\nIn their criticism of impractical, non-empirical \u2018book-learned\u2019 scholars, Ercker\nand Agricola concur. They also concur in their demarcation of fraudulent alchemists (the charlatans and quacks) from expert alchemists in whose experiential\nknowledge they trust. Both scholars base their works on the Erfahrungswissen of\n19\n\u201cSed Philosophi, Chymistae, Astrologi &amp; ortus metallorum causas perquirunt, quia nihil causa\nfiat: &amp; metalla nunc, ut quondam, ortu generati recte adferunt.

Haug\nthe practitioners, Ercker out of his professional experience and his contacts as tester\nof ores and as M\u20ac\nunzmeister, Agricola from his medical knowledge and his connections with the network of mining specialists surrounding Mathesius. When Agricola\nworked as a doctor in St. Joachimsthal, among his acquaintance he numbered the\nH\u20ac\nuttenschreiber Lorenz Wermann, the prototype of the learned mining engineer\nwho served as model for Agricolas\u2019s first montanistic publication, the Bermannus\nfrom 1530.21\nAgricola, like Ercker, criticises scholars who lack practical experience and can\nonly rely on handed down theoretical knowledge, that is, those who have episteme,\nbut not techne. Then he criticises the chymists, i.e. the alchemists, to whom he\ngrants some empirical and practical knowledge, but most of whom he dismisses as\nartificers of fraud and who are not on the same level as \u2018real\u2019 metallurgists.22\nThirdly Agricola takes on the astrologers, referring to the authors who claim that\nthe seven planets as formative powers influence some kind of primordial metallic\narch-matter to create the seven known metals. The theory that celestial bodies\ninfluence and shape earthly substances is treated at the beginning of Ru\u0308lein of\nCalw\u2019s Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein:\nFor the formation and growth of ores an effector is required and a subordinated material or\nmatter, which is adapted to receive the effect. The common effector of the ores and of all\nthings that are born is heaven with his orbits, his light and his influence, as the masters of\nnature teach. [. . .] Every ore receives a special influence from the planet he is named after,\nso that the planet and the ore concur in their warmth, coldness, humidity and aridity.23\nThe early modern efforts to categorize the world and its substances, based on\nlarge collections of minerals and the improved material knowledge of the natural\nscientist, started to challenge these obsolete systems. This is evident in Mathesius\u2019s\n\u201cThird Sermon,\u201d where he names the planets and their connection and influence on\nthe seven main metals. He distinguishes gold, golden silver, silver, copper, iron,\nsteel, lead, tin, bismuth, mercury and spie\u00dfglas and thus clearly enumerates more\nthan seven metals. Mathesius\u2019s text probably refers to the writings of Agricola, who\nemphasises the autonomy of bismuth and who uses the addition of this eighth\nspecies to the main metals as his most powerful argument against the star-forming\ntheories of metals:\nAccording to the opinion of the astrologers, the planet is constantly under the influence of\nforces that work on suitable substances in the womb of the earth and this create the ores.\nThis tale seemed so nice to many people that they said that the forces of the stars operate in\n21\nQuasi a prototype of Edgar Zilsels\u2019s \u2018superior craftman,\u2019 see Zilsel, \u201cRoots.\u201d\nFor the role and differing evaluations of the \u2018alchemist\u2019 in the sixteenth century, see Nummedal,\nAlchemy and Authority.\n23\n\u201cZur Entstehung und zum Wachsen der Erze geho\u0308rt ein Wirker und ein unterworfener Stoff oder\nMaterie, geeignet, die Wirkung zu empfangen.

One\nor more forming causes affect these primordial matters that all have the potentiality\nto be transformed, so that at one point this matter mutates into one of the known\nspecific metals, and consequently the different ore-deposits were formed. For\nexample, in his Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein Ru\u0308lein of Calw mentions mineral vapours, remotely\nreminiscent of Aristotle and Albertus, that rise as evaporation from the inner earth\nand condense to form ore deposits in the corridors and chasms of the mountains. He\nthen changes direction and ties these exhalationes back to alchemical concepts:\nThe subordinated thing, the common matter of all metals is according to the opinion and\nfaith of the scholars sulphur and quicksilver. Several believe, that due to the orbit and\ninfluence of the heaven, exhalations and vapour of sulphur and quicksilver\u2014called\nexhalationes minerales\u2014were drawn up and, during their ascent under the influence of\nthe planets, connected in the chasms and gaps and were made into ores.25\nThe whole range of early modern competing ideas of metallogenesis is revealed\nwhen Ru\u0308lein of Calw in the very next sentence introduces a Ghur (also discussed in\nthe \u201cThird Sermon\u201d of Mathesius) as a kind of \u201chumid, cold, mucous, completely\nsulphur-free matter, which is extracted virtually as sweat of the earth\u201d as an equally\nvalid theory, a humid and mucilaginous element able to transmute under the\n24\n\u201cAstrologorum autem sententia est, errantes stellas influxu &amp; viribus, quas exercent in materia,\nad id in terrae visceribus aptata, efficere metella: inerrantes vero gemmas.

IX).\n25\n\u201cDas unterworfene Ding, der gemeinsame Grundstoff aller Metalle sind nach Meinung und\nGlaube der Gelehrten Schwefel und Quecksilber. Etliche glauben, dass durch den Lauf und\nEinfluss des Himmels aus der Tiefe der Erde von Schwefel und Quecksilber Ausdu\u0308nstungen\noder Brodem \u2013 exhalationes minerales genannt \u2013 aufgezogen und wa\u0308hrend des Aufsteigens in\nGa\u0308ngen und Klu\u0308ften durch die Wirkung der Planeten vereinigt und zu einem Erz gemacht\nwerden.\u201d (Calw, Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein, 117\u20138).\n\nPages 113:\n90\nH. Haug\naddition of sulphur into one specific metal.26 Agricola discusses both the Aristotelian theory of steam or vapour and the alchemical sulphur-mercury theory and\nrejects both. He states that the Earth\u2019s crust absorbs water and earthy matter, thus\ncreating a certain nobilis succus as kind of mineral liquid that sediments in the\ncorridors and chasms of the mountains, there forming metallic minerals.\nThe hitherto discussed sources of early modern writers on metallogenetic questions have demonstrated\u2014despite the abundance of variety in the existing concepts\u2014that one basic assumption is nearly always present. Almost all theories offer\na dualistic system that operates on the dichotomy of a primary passive substance\nacted on by a potent cause. The involved antagonists are matter and an active\nformative power, or in other words: a creator and a material in which the creation\ncan manifest. This duality of primordial passive matter and active forming principle\ncan be thought of in terms of natural procreational processes which approximates\nthe third\u2014mineralistic\u2014to the other two reigns, the floral and the animalistic,\nwhere by seed or semen procreation and growth is initiated. If this biological\nanalogy taken from the animal and herbal kingdoms is applied to the mineral, it\ncan be extended to metallogenesis: if in the field of animals and plants male and\nfemale beings can be found who procreate by the union of the active and formative\nmale seeds or semen and the female passive receiving matter\u2014and if this means\nthat this species can recreate self-reliantly\u2014 then it is not too far fetched to suspect\ncomparable ways of reproduction and growth in the reign of minerals and assume\nthe existence of metal \u2018semen\u2019.\nOne of the advocates of the equation of all three kingdoms of nature, who awards\nmetals the power of self-propagation, is the famous potter and scientist Bernard\nPalissy (1510\u20131589) in his Discours Admirables.27 In this text in the form of a\ndialogue he has practique confront the\u0301orique. The latter represents scholarly and\nalchemical positions that maintain the possibility of mimicking metallogenetic\nprocesses by human art. For practique (who represents Palissys\u2019s own positions,\nas he poses as a learned artisan using his craft knowledge) the belief that man can\nimitate the creation of metals is presumptuous. Practique asks the\u0301orique:\nDo you think that I want to believe a Gerbert or a Arnaud de Villeneuve or a Roman de la\nRose in what they say against the works of Gold? And do you think that I am so\nmisinformed, that I do not know very well that Gold and Silver and all the other Metals\nare a divine work and that it is a temerarious enterprise against the glory of Gold to try to\nusurp that which is his realm?28\n26\n\u201cFeuchten, kalten, schleimigen, durchaus schwefelfreien Grundstoff, der gewisserma\u00dfen als ihr\nSchwei\u00df aus der Erde gezogen ist.\u201d (Calw, Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein, 118).\n27\nOn the work of Palissy, see Amico, Palissy; Hanschmann, Palissy; Kayser, \u201cIntellectual and\nArtisan\u201d; \u201cKemp, Philosophical Pots\u201d; Kris, Stil Rustique; Laube, \u201cWissenswelten\u201d; Schmeisser,\n\u201cErdgeschichte\u201d; Shell, \u201cCasting Life\u201d; and Klier, Fixierte Natur.\n28\n\u201cCuides tu que je vueille croie un Gerbert ou Arnauld de Vileneufve ou un Romant de la Rose,\nen ce qu\u2019ils auront parle\u0301 contre les euvres de Dieu?

I say on a level divine so that they are unknown to men: even\ninvisible.\u201d31\nFor Palissy the metal seed is a real fact but also an analogy for the alchemist who\ncounterfeits God\u2019s own work of growing metals, a divine process, which will\nremain encoded from man, because man (i.e. the scientist or the goldsmith) can\nonly work with the materials provided by God:\nIt is not without reason that I have said it is a work of God and that the seeds are the matter\nof metals and that He gives them growth and to men [the ability] to collect and to purify and\nto test, to melt and to ally, to cast them [the metals] into some forms as men see fit and\nuseful to them.32\nAgricola, however, rejects vehemently the idea of a semen-like origin of the\nmetals in De Ortu et Causis: \u201c[. . .] none of the things that occur in the earth can\nproduce something similar to itself [. . .] The minerals are not provided with seeds\nthat are capable of producing.\u201d\nThe Doppelscheuer\nAgainst the background of these briefly outlined metallogenetic concepts I will now\ndiscuss the Doppelscheuer (coconut vessel), from Vienna (Fig. 1).33 When opened,\nthe interior of the coconut reveals a very interesting scene: an artificial mountainous\nlandscape in which Adam and Eve are placed next to the tree of knowledge, all\nassembled by the hand of a goldsmith using different kinds of ores and semiprecious stones (Fig. 2). This object is a variation of a Handstein\u2014an exceptionally\nlarge or beautiful mineral that was sorted out of the smelting process and integrated\nin the context of the Kunstkammer, either in its natural form or transformed and\n29\n\u201ctu parles icy de semer; comme si les metaux venoyent de semence, comme le bled ou autres\nvegetatifs.\u201d (Palissy, \u201cDiscours admirables,\u201d 106).\n30\n\u201cservir comme une matrice a\u0300 la generation des metaux.\u201d; \u201cvoulant imiter la matrice de la femme\nou de la beste.\u201d (Palissy, \u201cDiscours admirables,\u201d 107).\n31\n\u201cles matieres des metaux sont semence divines.

And because we\nwould like to have them, we graciously command you to instruct in our place our\nM\u20ac\nunzmeister in St. Joachimsthal, to request these pieces of minerals from the goldsmith\nin the near future, and instruct him to send them to the Bohemian Chamber packaged in\nsuch a way, that they will not take damage and that you\u2014when they have arrived\u2014will\nsend them to us immediately.36\nThis letter testifies that Caspar Ulich must have been one of the leading goldsmiths in St. Joachimsthal and was associated with the artistic transformation of\nvaluable minerals\u2014and that the Emperor was much aware of him and controlled\nvery carefully what materials were sent to his workshop.\nA second source attests further that St. Joachimsthal must have had a monopoly\non the knowledge of processing these Handsteine: the widow of the goldsmith\nRuprecht Puellacher, who served as mintmaster of St. Joachimsthal, offered in 1564\na Handstein reworked by her husband to Emperor Maximilian II for the sum of\n7000 Taler.37 The emperor asked his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand II, as a\nconnoisseur of such works, to estimate the value of the hand stone. Ferdinand\nreplied to his brother in a letter dated 12 July:\nThe estimate is wanting, as here in Bohemia there are no similar goldsmiths or artists who\nunderstand how to treat such materials, and if the goldsmiths of St. Joachimsthal who\nworked on such Handsteine for several years were to be asked, it is to be feared, that they\nmay well esteem and respect this artwork so highly that it will be very expensive for your\nimperial Majesty.38\nFerdinand admits that the estimation of these objects is not easy due to the fact\nthat in Bohemia only the goldsmiths of St. Joachimsthal are specialized enough in\nthe transformation of minerals into Handsteine to make a valuation and thus the\npossibilities of comparison are lacking.\n36\n\u201cWir fuegen euch genedigist zu wissen, das im Jochimstal ein goldschmidt, Caspar Ulich\ngenant; der hat ungeferlich sechszehn stuckh roch goldens erzt, so uns zusteet, bei seinen handen.\nUnd weil wir dann solichs gerne haben wollten, so bevelhen wir euch demnach himit gnedigist, ir\nwellt unserm mu\u0308nzmaister daselbst im Joachimsthal an unser statt auferlegen, das er soliche stuckh\nertz alsbals von ihm dem goldschmidt abfordern und sie euch unser Behaimbischen cammer zu\nhanden wolverwart und also eingemacht, das sie nit schaden nehmen, schickhe, und wann ir die\nbekhommen habt, sie uns alsdann unverzu\u0308glich u\u0308bersenden.\u201d (Fischer, Kaiser Rudolf II, 2).\n37\nArchiv des Ministeriums des Inneren (heute O\u0308sterreichisches Staatsarchiv), Kopialbuch 75, fol.\n113\u20134, cit.

Haug\nThe Doppelscheuer, which might also originate from the Joachimsthal workshops, although it was not created from a single Erzstufe (prill) but was assembled\nfrom several minerals, must be understood in this context. It is an extremely rare\nand valuable object, created in a mining area by a goldsmith for aristocratic\ncollectors and their Kunstkammern.\nThese objects were not created by ignorant craftsmen for a disinterested audience, rather they evidence a great sensibility on the part of the maker as well as the\nrecipient. These works of art found their true purpose and destiny in allegorical\nallusions, in suggested references and complicated reference systems that had to be\ndeciphered gradually by attentive observation. They were catalysts for the pleasure\nof a learned conservation in which two or more beholders could exchange their\nsagacious and sharp-witted interpretations.\nSurely the learned beholder of the sixteenth century would have first noticed the\nuntreated and rough surface of the coconut. An exterior that in comparison to a\ncontemporaneous \u2018correctly\u2019 accomplished coconut vessel must have been disappointing and might even have been read as a lack of virtuosity in the executive\nmaster. But after opening the vessel and discovering the hidden world within, he\nwould have been all the more surprised and astonished by the wit of the goldsmith,\nwho consciously used the natural form as a hint to its \u2018grown\u2019 content. While\ndeciphering the iconography of the inner scenery, the observer may have thought\nabout the forbidden fruit, the expulsion from Paradise, the loss of innocence and\nthus the loss of the \u2018uncultivated\u2019, i.e. pre-cultural status of humanity.\nNot only iconographical programs, such as the reliefs at the foot of the Florentine Campanile (which might go back to a design by Giotto (1266\u20131337)) or the\ndepictions on the city palace of Ancona, assert this connection between the Fall and\nthe onset of \u2018artificial\u2019 human activity.39 This connection was often emphasized,\nespecially in texts that were aimed at artists and artisans. An early example is found\nin the preface to the chapter on painting by Theophilus Presbyter in De diversis\nartibus where he writes:\nWe read in the exordium of mundane creation that man, made after the image and likeness\nof God and animated by the inspiration of the Divine breath, was also, by the excellence of\nso much dignity, raised above other living creatures; as capable of reason, he merited to\nparticipate in the counsel and genius of Divine providence, and, gifted with free-will, he\nbeheld superior to himself but the will of his Maker and the obligation to reverence his\ndecree. Wherefore, miserably deceived by diabolical astuteness, he lost the privilege of\nimmortality through the fault of disobedience, yet so transmitted his power of wisdom and\nintelligence to his posterity, that whoever would supply care and application might be able\nto acquire a capability of every art and science, as by a hereditary right. In this manner,\nhuman industry, seizing upon this faculty and applying itself in its divers acts to gain and to\npleasure, transmitted it, through the development of time, to the predestined epoch of the\nChristian religion, and it came to pass that a people devoted to God converted to his worship\nthat which Divine ordinance had, to the praise and glory of His name, created. On this\n39\nBlume, \u201cJenseits des Paradieses.\u201d\n\nPages 118:\nArtificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things: Shared. . .\n95\naccount, the pious devotion of the faithful may not neglect that which the careful prevision\nof our predecessors transmitted to our age [. . .]40\nThis association of the Fall of mankind and the beginning of cultivation, that\nis of artisanal human activity, is pointed out even by God, who announces to\nAdam that from now on he has to feed himself with the work of his own hands\n(Genesis 3, 17\u20139):\nAnd unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast\neaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the\nground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and\nthistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy\nface shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\nIn the text of Theophilus Presbyter this connection between the human ability of\nartisanal creativity through his divine derivation (the man as imago and similitudo\nof God according to his faculty) is emphasized. But the negative connotations of all\nhuman artistic creation as the result of the Fall is turned positively into a iure\nhereditario, into the ability to create art and ingenium. For the contemporary\nbeholder the connection of Kunstkammer and Fall of Mankind and the correlation\nof the ability of man to create and cultivate and the loss of the paradisiacal, per\ndefinition non-cultivated condition, must have been obvious.41\nBehind the biblical scene the viewer discovers miners at work, a diviner, who is\nin search of ore deposits, and two workers with wedges extracting minerals from the\nsurface (Fig. 3). Rotating the coconut vessel, the viewer finds more miners, and the\nearly modern collector might have understood another allusion to the inner coherence of the hard work of ore mining and the Fall of Mankind, two scenes that the\ngoldsmith certainly did not combine by chance in the interior of this coconut vessel.\nHe might possibly also have thought about the scientific advances in mineralogy\nand metallurgy as part of the cultivating processes that were achieved by humanity\nsince the Fall.\nHe would certainly have understood, that the divine command not to eat from the\nforbidden tree of knowledge does not extend to the prohibition of scientific knowledge and progress. The early modern occupation with the possibilities of natural\nscience always included the emphasis that the investigation, the unveiling and\nunderstanding of nature might mean a return to the paradisiacal original state, a\nreversion of the lost Adamic comprehension of the world by just naming it, and that\nthe reading of the book of nature could be the equivalent to reading God\u2019s\nrevelation.42 This becomes evident when Mathesius says that the precise causes\n40\nTheophilus, Essay Upon Various Arts (1847), XLV\u2013XLVII.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 101 to 119 of *Laboratories of Art*. Here’s an overview:

- <strong>Artificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things</strong>: The section highlights the shared metallurgical and artisanal knowledge between goldsmiths, alchemists, and mining professionals. It explores how the practical craft knowledge of metals was not only applied but also became intertwined with alchemical and philosophical theories of the time. An object like a mounted coconut reworked by a goldsmith reflects these complex interactions between artistic virtuosity and metallurgical lore.

- <strong>Goldsmiths&#x27; Knowledge and Metallogenesis</strong>: Goldsmiths, like the ones in the mining city of St. Joachimsthal, played a critical role in translating natural philosophical ideas about metals into material form. They worked alongside alchemists and miners, using shared knowledge to create complex objects, often intended for aristocratic collections. Their work represented a blend of empirical craftsmanship and scholarly speculation.

- <strong>Interplay of Religious and Philosophical Ideas</strong>: Theological interpretations, particularly those surrounding the divine creation of metals, were integral to early modern discussions on metallogenesis. Figures like Johannes Mathesius, who combined religious sermons with scientific lectures, illustrated how closely alchemical and metallurgical knowledge was tied to spiritual beliefs.

- <strong>Artisanal Objects as Symbols</strong>: Objects created by goldsmiths were not merely decorative but contained layers of meaning, often serving as vehicles for philosophical discussions. The hidden landscapes and allegorical depictions within these objects engaged viewers in discussions about humanity&#x27;s relationship with nature, art, and knowledge.

- <strong>Choice Quote</strong>: &quot;Mathesius starts by comparing God&#x27;s formative acts with the practice of the human artisan, who imitates nature in his workshop...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 105](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=105).

The discussion of early modern theories on\nmetallogenesis has shown, that the creative process of the human artist and artisan\nwas compared to the natural genesis of the divine artifex. The same primordial\nmatters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to\n\u2018nature\u2019.

A learned\nreference to contemporary Italian art theory could have followed, that is, to the\ncreation of Man in the image of God and Man\u2019s power to know, imitate and control\nnature. Federico Zuccari (c.1540\u20131609) for example addresses man as \u201calmost\nsecond God,\u201d who received from God the ability of an inner design by which he\ncan understand the world and by which, in imitation of Gold and in emulation of\nnature can create an infinite number of things, so that he can represent a new\nparadise on earth:\nHe would be almost a second God, he [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120\nPages: 120,119\nto the subject of God as craftsman who, like his earthly colleague, is dependent on\ngood materials and hot fires to make excellent stones and minerals.

Formally speaking, the minerals within the coconut can be understood as an allusion to the alchemical theory of the \u2018seed/semen-origin\u2019 of the\nmetals, as proposed by Palissy. The object thus represents the idea of the versed\nalchemist, respectively of the alchemist in possession of metal-seeds, who would be\nable to let ores grow. And at the same time it translates this idea into the artificial\narea, introducing the artifex, the goldsmith, as creator of the nut full of minerals in\nhis working progress.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of <strong>artificial interventions in the natural form of things</strong> highlights the ways in which Renaissance artists, artisans, and alchemists used their knowledge to imitate and manipulate natural processes. Key themes include:

1. <strong>Imitating Nature in Artistic and Alchemical Practice</strong>:
   Renaissance thinkers believed that natural processes could be emulated by skilled human intervention. Goldsmiths and metalworkers were seen as &quot;imitators of nature,&quot; using the same primary materials (sulfur and quicksilver) that nature used to form metals. This concept extended to alchemists, who believed their work of refining and transforming metals was an imitation of natural metallogenesis. This process often positioned the human creator alongside divine creation, reflecting the idea that humans could, in a sense, imitate God&#x27;s creative powers.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The creative process of the human artist and artisan was compared to the natural genesis of the divine artifex.

   Early modern collections known as Kunstkammern (cabinets of curiosities) displayed natural and artificially created objects side by side. This juxtaposition showcased not only the skills of artists in mimicking nature but also their ability to mimic the processes of nature. Objects created through metallurgical and alchemical processes were valued for their ability to demonstrate the control and understanding humans had over natural materials.

3. <strong>Human Creation as &#x27;Second Nature&#x27;</strong>:
   Renaissance philosophers, such as Leonardo da Vinci, referred to human inventions and creations as &quot;second nature.&quot; This concept recognized that while humans could not create in the same way that nature did, they could replicate and modify natural processes through their technological interventions. Alchemy played a role in this &quot;second nature&quot; by refining substances through human effort.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Gravity and force together with material movement and percussion are the four accidental powers by which the human race in its marvelous and varied works seems to reveal itself and a second nature in this world.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 82](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=82).

The blending of natural and artificial processes in Renaissance art and alchemy reflects a deep philosophical engagement with the manipulation of matter and the belief that human intervention could refine, perfect, or mimic nature’s processes.

Mathesius\nstates for example, that areas in the vicinity of the earthly paradise (i.e. somewhere\nin the vicinity of Persia) have particularly excellent mineral and gemstone deposits,\nbecause in these regions the earth still reverberates in memory of the voice of God.\nAfter a meticulously detailed examination of the serpent\u2019s body the beholder\nwould have noticed an analogy between the artificial braided silver and the naturally occurring forms of a massive silver wire, a curious detail where the artist\u2019s\nhand and the formative power of nature enter into a competitive rivalry. A learned\nreference to contemporary Italian art theory could have followed, that is, to the\ncreation of Man in the image of God and Man\u2019s power to know, imitate and control\nnature. Federico Zuccari (c.1540\u20131609) for example addresses man as \u201calmost\nsecond God,\u201d who received from God the ability of an inner design by which he\ncan understand the world and by which, in imitation of Gold and in emulation of\nnature can create an infinite number of things, so that he can represent a new\nparadise on earth:\nHe would be almost a second God, he [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to\nform within himself a mental inner design, so that he [man] by means of this could\nrecognize all the creatures &amp; to create inside him new worlds, &amp; inside would have\n[in form of] a spiritual existence &amp; would enjoy all that, what he enjoys outside [in the\nouter world] as natural existence &amp; and dominates; &amp; in addition by the means of this\ndesign, almost imitating God, &amp; emulating the Nature he [man] could produce infinite\nartificial things which are similar to the natural ones, &amp; and by means of painting, &amp;\nsculpture, makes us see new Paradises on earth.44\nAccording to Zuccari\u2019s art theoretical writings, it is the similarity to God that\nenables both the scientist and the artist to achieve an inner understanding of\nnature\u2014the scientist through research to unveil nature\u2019s secrets and the artist in\nartworks that imitate nature\u2019s processes. This seems to be the basic assumption that\nunderlies all early modern manipulation of and acting with metals: naturally formed\nminerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only\nthe mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also\nto imitate the natural processes. The discussion of early modern theories on\nmetallogenesis has shown, that the creative process of the human artist and artisan\nwas compared to the natural genesis of the divine artifex. The same primordial\nmatters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to\n\u2018nature\u2019. All four follow the same working processes, only their ability differentiates the final products. The juxtaposition of form and matter, which is thought of as\na dichotomy of active force-shaping power and passive shape-receiving material, is\nof greatest importance with regard to God and his creation, which stands as a model\nboth for the visual artist as well as the alchemist, who tries to recreate natural\nprocesses according to his will.\n44\nZuccari, L\u2019idea [1607], Book I, ch. VII, 14. See also the facsimile reproduction Zuccari, Scritti\nd\u2019Arte (1961), 162.\n\nPages 121:\n98\nH. Haug\nIt is not only difficult; it is almost impossible to compare the content of a written\ntext with the content of an object. But it seems inadequate to narrow early modern\nforms and methods of scientific display down to \u2018codified\u2019 knowledge: since the\n1920s a long line of historians of science have studied how the input of workmen\nchanged the methods of Renaissance natural philosophy towards a more matterbased natural scientific research and \u2018experiment\u2019. The concept of the \u2018superior\ncraftsmen\u2019, introduced by Edgar Zilsel in 1942, who started to interact with\nacademics and humanists, is just one of the many important texts dealing with the\nexchange between the artes mechanicae and the artes liberales from the fifteenth\ncentury onwards, a theory which was recently elaborated and confirmed by Pamela\nH. Smith in The Body of the Artisan in 2004 and by Pamela O. Long in Artisan/\nPractitioners in 2011.45 Again in 2004, Davis Baird\u2019s contribution on \u2018thing\nknowledge\u2019 focussed on a \u2018philosophy of scientific instruments\u2019 and distinguishes\nwithin this epistemology of the artificial object three forms in which an instrument\ncan represent knowledge: firstly as model, secondly as product and medium of\nworking knowledge and thirdly as embodiment of \u2018encapsulated knowledge\u2019. His\ntheoretical system not only applied to scientific instruments, but can also be adapted\nto other artificially created objects, for instance to the Handsteine. In this field, it\noffers a wide range of interpretative layers in connection to alchemical knowledge:\nFirst, the Handstein as \u2018model\u2019: two forms of exemplary representations can be\ndistinguished interpreting the vessel both from a formal and from an iconographical\npoint of view. Formally speaking, the minerals within the coconut can be understood as an allusion to the alchemical theory of the \u2018seed/semen-origin\u2019 of the\nmetals, as proposed by Palissy. The object thus represents the idea of the versed\nalchemist, respectively of the alchemist in possession of metal-seeds, who would be\nable to let ores grow. And at the same time it translates this idea into the artificial\narea, introducing the artifex, the goldsmith, as creator of the nut full of minerals in\nhis working progress. In this model, natural, alchemical and artificial creative\nprocesses are blended together.\nIconographically speaking the vessel represents a model of the dichotomy of\nmale/female, form/matter: Adam and Eve embody this principle and simultaneously their action indicates the beginning of every human productive action.\nAfter the Fall, every human action is per definitionem a repetition of natural\ncreative processes. Embedded in the context of the miners and the general subject\nof minerals and their genesis and extraction, is the idea of God as creator of metals\nand the human propensity to imitate this processes\u2014whether in alchemical or\nartisanal ways.46\nSecond, the Handstein as product of working knowledge: This object has also a\nmaterial significance, because it is the product of applied (al)chemical knowledge.\nEvery piece of art emanating from the goldsmith\u2019s workshop is the embodiment of\nchemical lore concerning material properties and agency. It is important to note,\n45\n46\nZilsel, \u201cRoots\u201d; Smith, Body of the Artisan; and Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, ch. III, 34\u2013114.\n\nPages 122:\nArtificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things: Shared. . .\n99\nthat the procedures applied by an alchemist and by a goldsmith are in large parts the\nsame: both required the know how to purify metals, to isolate them from the mixed\nmineral forms they are found in and transform them into massive pure metals. Both\nthe alchemist and the goldsmith share the same theoretical concepts, assuming that\nsulphur and quicksilver are the two original components of all metals. By alloying\nthese metals, by forcing them into forms, both locate their actions within the context\nof natural metallogenesis and both suppose, that they thereby imitate God and his\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge. But\nneither is it as useless as the modern beholder of such objects might reckon. The\nobject had its place in the early modern Wissenskultur, which operates with\nanalogies. It brought together the practitioner, whose actions included alchemical\nlore, with the theorist, who tried to balance alchemical theories, antique mineral\nlore and the newly emerging empirical knowledge from the mining areas, with the\nsovereign. The latter was interested in alchemical and montanistic research for\npolitical as well as economic reasons and used Handsteine and comparable objects\nto stage metallogenetical themes at his court.\n47\nBa\u0308umel, \u201cDarstellung des Bergbaus,\u201d 213\u20135.\n\nPages 123:\n100\nH. Haug\nConclusion\nIn conclusion I readdress the questions asked at the beginning of this article. All\nfour questions are inextricably linked: the analysis of the coconut vessel reveals a\nvast number of formal and iconographical references to the metallogenetic theories\nnegotiated in contemporary discourses, which were embedded in the larger context\nof art-theoretical ideas on the relationship between man and nature as well as\nbetween form and matter. This is not surprising, because goldsmiths, alchemist\nand Montantwissenschaftler (mining professionals) moved in the same \u2018spaces\u2019\u2014\nlocally and discursively. The example of St. Joachimsthal illustrates the importance\nof the concept of \u2018trading zones\u2019 for the transfer of knowledge between different\nprofessional categories, recently brought into focus by Pamela O Long: in this\nmining centre the persons processing metals drew their knowledge from the same\ntheoretical writings and treat their matter with the same practices: goldsmiths,\nalchemist and Pr\u20ac\nufer (assayer) all were employed in the processes of melting,\npurifying, and re-forming ores.48 The examples cited from the treatise as well as\nfrom the sermon text of Mathesius showed that there was a common Vorstellungshorizont, culturally anchored in the Christian faith, that facilitated exchange and\ndiscourse among the different professional groups.\nWith the help of the coconut vessel and comparable objects, by the transformation of the ore into a Handstein and the translocation from its natural environment\nin the context of the court, these metallurgical discourses materialized and could be\nstaged in the present of the ruler, who was\u2014due to political and economic reasons\u2014also interested in montanistic research.\nThe Doppelscheuer\u2014an object between art and science\u2014thus appears to be a\nlink between the mine and the workshop of the goldsmith, between scholarly\ndiscourse and the ordered world of the princely Kunstkammer.\nBibliography\n1990.

One of the forefathers of modern European\nmuseums, they were built by Giorgio Vasari to cater for Cosimo I\u2019s public offices,\nand were later partly transformed into a gallery by Francesco I de\u2019 Medici (1541\u2013\n1587). Laboratories of art and alchemy were placed side by side by the Grand\nDukes Francesco I and Ferdinando I de\u2019 Medici (1587\u20131609) to facilitate collaboration between artists and scientists. Goldsmiths, jewellers, cabinetmakers, sculptors, painters, and cutters of semi-precious stones exchanged not only equipment,\nbut also theoretical and technical knowledge with the alchemists who worked in the\nUffizi. The pieces that survive demonstrate that the style of the objects created there\nwas a direct result of this collaboration. Thanks to the combined study of archival\ndocuments and unpublished maps, the artists\u2019 workshops and the alchemists\u2019\nfonderia (foundry) can now be located inside the building. Moreover, thanks to\nan unpublished inventory, we can easily visualise the organisation of the fonderia\nlaboratories, their furniture and the tools that were used. After a short historical\nintroduction, this paper focuses on the material aspects of this collaboration: the\nworking processes, the exchange of instruments between the laboratories, their\nlocation in the building and the purpose and destination of the art objects produced.\nConsidered by some the ancestor of modern museums, the Uffizi were first built by\nGiorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574) to cater for Cosimo I\u2019s (1519\u20131574) public offices. In\n1586, just before his death, Grand Duke Francesco I de\u2019 Medici arranged for artist\u2019s\nworkshops to be located at the Uffizi and made the second floor a gallery.

We may wonder why such bulky installations,\nincluding large furnaces and forges, were placed within the Uffizi palace. The\nreasons are quite complex. They involve not only the usefulness of the production\nprocesses for the other workshops established in the palace, or reasons related to\nexclusiveness and secrecy of the production of remedies, but also philosophical\nreasons related to the encyclopaedic function of the organisation.\nIn fact, the way the Uffizi activities gathered together different types of know\nhow tallies with an encyclopaedic vision of human action on nature. The system of\ncross-references and correspondences reflect a characteristic aspect of collections\nunique to this period. Thus, the theatre was close to the musical instruments\nworkshop; the Stanza delle Matematiche and the Stanza delle carte geografiche\ncontained the maps and scientific instruments built on site, such as the \u201cmacchina\nuniversale del mondo,\u201d a large armillary sphere made by Antonio Santucci. The\nTribuna provided a frame for the most precious objects, natural or artificial:\njewellery, precious stones and other mirabilia most of which came from the\ngoldsmith\u2019s or the pietre dure cutters\u2019 workshops. In 1588, Ferdinando I set up a\nbig collection of arms and exotic objects in four rooms near the Tribuna, placed\nexactly above the armoury workshops. In same year, Ludovico Buti decorated the\nvaults of the armoury rooms with scenes of battles and views of the workshops on\nthe first floor (Fig. 2). In the corridors treasured antique and modern statues were\n\nPages 129:\nThe Laboratories of Art and Alchemy at the Uffizi Gallery in Renaissance. . .\n107\nFig. 2 Armoury\nworkshops, fresco,\nLudovico Buti. 1588\n(Courtesy of the Uffizi,\nFlorence)\ndisplayed under the Giovian series of portraits. In parallel, a restoration workshop\nfor sculptures and a painters\u2019 workshop completed the series of know how. Finally,\na garden planted with botanic samples on the roof of the Loggia dei Lanzi echoed\nback to the fonderia, situated on the same floor.1\nAccording to the archival sources, Francesco I had the original idea of putting\ntogether collections and workshops (Ferdinando I\u2019s brother and predecessor). He\nhad the necessary philosophical education and cultural knowledge to imagine and\nexecute this complex yet coherent project.2 From the beginning it was the prince\nalchemist\u2019s brainchild to establish a program gathering naturalia, artificialia and\nknow how of all kinds under one roof, that would work together like an \u2018encyclopaedic machine\u2019, a kind of monumental clock. The analogy between mechanics and\nthe organisation of the Uffizi is not forced: not only were clocks actually built there,\nbut all crafts worked together synchronically.\nArtistic objects unique in Europe resulted from this association of technique and\naesthetics, and met with great success in other courts. In fact, the uniqueness of the\nUffizi lies in its administrative and economic organisation: as soon as Ferdinando I\nbecame grand duke, he established a new governmental organ, the Galleria dei\nlavori, ruled by a complex hierarchy of ministers, secretaries and intendants.3 This\nnew institution was completely devoted to the service of the court and the State, it\ndirectly served the grand duke\u2019s political, diplomatic and economic purposes.\nIndeed, the Uffizi workshops mass-produced specific products for Ferdinando I\u2019s\n1\nFor more on the Uffizi collections in the sixteenth century, see among many others Heikamp,\n\u201cGeschichte der Uffizien-Tribuna\u201d; Acidini, Magnificenza alla Corte; Paolozzi Strozzi &amp; Zikos,\nGiambologna; and Zorzi &amp; Sperenzi, Teatro e spettacolo.

Kieffer\ndiplomatic and tributary requirements.4 In order to best please his allies or to create\nnew alliances, he sent counsellors or spies to other courts (for example, the spy and\nscholar Filippo Pigafetta, the cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, and the musician and art collector Emilio de\u2019 Cavalier, who later became the superintendent of\nthe Galleria dei lavori) and orientated the production of the laboratories according\nto their reports.5 In short, under Ferdinando I, the Galleria dei lavori in the Uffizi\nbecame a real machine at the service of the State.\nEconomy and profitability were the two main criteria of the administration of the\nGalleria dei lavori. The budget allocated to the court and to the Uffizi was very\nrestricted and limited to the indispensable. The workshops were placed in the\nbuilding in order to rationalize the use of expensive materials and tools. The artists\nand artisans practiced several disciplines moving freely from one area to another\nwith no hierarchal distinction. A tinello (canteen) and accommodation saved time at\nlunchtime and spared the costs of vitto e allogio (food and accommodation) for\nmany employees. The salaries were strictly regulated and the employees could not\nwork for other patrons. This was to try and inhibit knowledge and skills from leaving\nthe court. However, the savings realised on the functioning of the Galleria dei lavori\nwere used to buy sumptuous materials: the grand duke did not hesitate to buy the\nbest stones and quantities of precious metals to make the luxurious objects.6 As a\nresult, the production was very specific and shows the collaboration between all the\ndependants, artists and scientists. Indeed, the collaboration between painters and\npietre dure engravers encouraged the creation of new techniques for the painting on\nstone or for a commesso so fine that it looks like painting (Figs. 3 and 4).7 Sculptors\nand confectioners joined forces to make sugar statues for banquets; alchemists and\npainters collaborated on scientific illustration (Fig. 5) and invented new techniques\n4\nFor more on Ferdinando de Medici gift politics, see Butters, \u201cUses and Abuses of Gifts.\u201d Butters\nconcentrates her study on Ferdinando\u2019s politics as a cardinal and doesn\u2019t focus on art objects, but\nshe gives an idea about the importance, in terms of quantity and meaning, of his gifts.

Indeed, although most of the European courts were equipped with\nartistic workshops or laboratories, or even sometimes with both\u2014the courts of\nMantua, Prague, Kassel or Munich spring to mind\u2014none of these were subject to\nsuch administrative rules and restrictions. Neither did their production serve exactly\nthe same purpose: in most cases, other princes ordered art objects or medicines for\ntheir own use and pleasure, for their palace, or for their friends, with no specific\npolitical agenda.9\nThe Fonderia in the Uffizi: Origins and Material\nOrganisation\nIntroduction to the Fonderia\nThe fonderia was made up of a series of rooms on the second floor of the Uffizi. In\nthis period a fonderia was a laboratory for the arts using fire: metal work and\ngoldsmith activities, alchemy, chemistry, and pharmacy (in this period remedies\nwere made by distillation and extraction of essential oils). There was no precise\ndistinction between the disciplines, for example, alchemy, chemistry and pharmacy\nare often simply known as \u2018distillation\u2019. Thanks to the inventories conserved in the\narchives, we can easily visualise the organisation of the laboratories, their equipment, furnishings and tools.\nThe first room housed the dispensary, where medicines were weighed and\npacked before shipment. It was also here that raw material arrived to be transformed\nin the fonderia. The dispensary was fitted with cabinets, a counter with two scales,\nspoons and funnels, a bench and storage cases. This room was the only one\naccessible to people who did not belong to the fonderia.10 The three following\nrooms included a terrace, a \u2018tower\u2019 (a blast furnace) and other furnaces, and housed\na complete set of copper distillation tools: eight bains-marie, stoves, plates with\ncovers, basins, bell-jars, mortars and many other small instruments.11 These were\n8\nOn scientific illustration in late sixteenth-century Florence, see Ligozzi, I ritratti; Tongiorgi\nTomasi &amp; Tosi, \u201cFlora e Pomona\u201d; Bassani Pacht et al., Marie de Me\u0301dicis; and Garfagnini,\nFirenze e la Toscana, vol. II. Some of those objects conceived by clock-makers and scientific\ninstrument builders can be seen in the exhibition catalogue: Acidini, Magnificenza alla Corte.\n9\nFor more information on the differences and similarities between the Galleria dei lavori and the\nother European court\u2019s workshops, see Kieffer, Ferdinando I de Me\u0301dicis.\n10\n\u201cChe nessuno pratichi in detta Fonderia eccetto nella prima stanza dove si distribuischono li\nmedicamenti.\u201d (ASF, GM 403, ins. 2, fol. 120).\n11\nThe \u201cterraces\u201d mentioned in the inventory don\u2019t exist anymore, but we can deduce from the\narchival sources they were little open rooms made of wood.\n\nPages 134:\n112\nF. Kieffer\nfollowed by a huge distillation laboratory including an ordigno (machine) to distil\nacquavite composed of 60 glass balls, a bain-marie, pallets full of glass pots of all\nkind and a pierced bench to place the separatoie (separators). The following room\nwas full of medicine cabinets and the final room was a smithy including another\nterrace, equipped with all the tools traditional to this activity (anvil, pincers,\nsledgehammers etc.).\nThe Origins of the Fonderia: The Casino di San Marco\nAt the same time, another fonderia in Florence witnessed similar activities. This\nwas the fonderia in the Casino di San Marco, created by Francesco I long before the\none in the Uffizi. The visitors and chroniclers of the time gave famous accounts of\nthe experiments Francesco I lead there: for example, he found a way to melt rock\ncrystal and to imitate Chinese porcelain; he made false precious stones, fireworks,\nand explosives. He experimented with new remedies on dying people, and he\npracticed alchemy. He did not turn his back on the arts of painting, sculpture,\nillumination or goldsmithing \u201cand around those things he spends quite all the time\nin a place called Casino, where he has many rooms with masters who do different\nworks and there he keeps his stills.\u201d12\nAccording to the traditional historiography, the young prince Francesco untiringly frequented Cosimo I\u2019s fonderie, set up in the Palazzo Vecchio, and so\nrecognised in himself the passion that was to prompt him his life long.13 In fact,\nas early as 1570, he ordered the architect Bernardo Buontalenti to draw up the plans\nfor the Casino di San Marco: he intended to transform it into a palace worthy of a\nprince and to display there his patronage in arts and sciences. In 1574, when Cosimo\nI died, Francesco took possession of the Casino and of its gardens and set up the first\ncourt workshops. Besides the artistic workshops, the palace included a fonderia\nwell known for its alchemical research, and its unusual layout. Indeed the suite of\nadjoining rooms forms a closed circle, a labyrinth that follows a strict structural\nlogic and hermetic aesthetic similar to that of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio.14\nWhen Francesco I died, in 1587, the usufruct of the Casino went to his son, Don\nAntonio (1576\u20131621). Ferdinando I, succeeding his brother on the grand-ducal\nthrone, accepted the donation.15 However, Don Antonio, who was still a child,\ncontinued his education at the Pitti palace with the other children of the court and\n12\nThis is the famous ambassador Gussoni\u2019s account when he visits the Casino in 1576.

Nel quale si contiene tutta l\u2019Arte spagirica di Teofrasto Paracelso, the\nfrontispiece of which was dated 1604, is an eloquent testimony of these activities\n(Fig. 6).17 The traditional bibliographic note of this book has always considered the\ndate on the frontispiece and attributed the writing to Don Antonio\u2019s entourage.18\nHowever, a thorough reading of all the recipes reveals a brief note explaining that\nthe writing of the book was undertaken in 1588, during the first year of Ferdinando\nI\u2019s reign.19 We can deduce that the new grand duke headed two fonderie\u2014the one in\nthe Casino di San Marco and the other in the Uffizi.\nFor the period we are interested in, two types of sources enable a reconstruction\nof the activities of the two fonderie. For the Casino di San Marco the Apparato\n16\nSee Covoni, Buontalenti ai tempi medicei.\nApparato, BNCF, Magl.

Kieffer\npreviously mentioned lists all the projects and recipes worked on in its laboratories.\nFor the Uffizi, comparison and cross-referencing of the Casino reports with the rare\naccounts directly from the fonderia allow an estimation of its production.\nThere are many similarities between the two institutions even if the destination\nof the products and the very essence of their purpose are basically opposed. The\nlayout of the rooms was very similar and both were located near to a botanical\ngarden (even if the one in the Loggia dei Lanzi was very small and its planting very\nlimited). The activities were also the same: distillery of medicinal plants and\nmetals, glass art, pharmacopoeia, smelting and forging metals. Only the art of\nporcelain was apparently exclusive to the Casino. In the Casino goldsmithing had\na favoured place in the fonderia, whereas in the Uffizi the goldsmith workshops\nwere some distance from the fonderia (although artists forged some items in them).\nWe do not precisely know who worked in the Casino. Nor do the sources reveal\nwhich role Ferdinando I played in the research carried out in the Casino before Don\nAntonio\u2019s take over in 1597. But numerous clues suggest a permanent collaboration\nbetween the two fonderie.\nThe rare author\u2019s names mentioned by the Apparato are unfortunately unknown\nin the historiography: the main author \u201cGiovanni alchemista\u201d (Giovanni the alchemist) who, speaking in the first person, recorded his own experiences as well as\nrecipes taken from contemporaries or from ancient sources; someone called \u201cG.B.\u201d\n(Giovambattista perhaps) present in 1588; a \u201cfamous Lord\u201d Alessandro Cervino;\nand a \u201cSignor Marcantonio.\u201d \u201cGiovanni the alchemist\u201d notes in his book the origin\nof the recipes. Some of them were Francesco I\u2019s doctors, such as Baccio Baldini\n(already a court doctor under Cosimo I) in charge of the Library in San Lorenzo, or\nMichelangiolo Angeli da Barga.20 He also quotes the book of the Secret of Secret by\nthe pseudo Aristotle and the Bible.21 But the name that appears most often is\nTheophraste Paracelsus, the Swiss doctor mentioned on the frontispiece of\nthe work.\nThe Apparato compiles thousands of recipes and secrets in no obvious order,\nwith no introduction or table of contents. It shows very diverse interests: the\nexplored subjects range from transmutation of metals to chiromancy and from\nastrology to ballistics. Despite the formal proclamation on the frontispiece of the\nApparato, Paracelsus was not directly present in the four books: neither are there\n20\nFor example: \u201cUntione cordiale hauta da Messer Baccio Baldini. Capitolo 397.\u201d (Apparato,\nBNCF, Magl. XVI, 63, I, fol. 313). In the roles of 1588 (ASF, DG 389, fol. 10), Baccio Baldini is\nmentioned as one of the \u201cMedici e spetiali\u201d and also \u201cMesser Baccio Baldini per la cura della\nlibreria di San Lorenzo, scudi 16\u201d; Michelangelo Angeli da Barga is cited among others in\nApparato, BNCF, Magl.

Capitolo 299.\u201d (Apparato, BNCF, Magl.

The Swiss scientist\u2019s name was only used to suggest the\nbenefits of the chemical arts and as an authority to legitimise the secrets it was\nused to endorse.22 Besides, unlike the Uffizi, an inventory of the Casino from 1621\nallows us to reconstruct an extensive chemical library in which around 200 titles are\nindexed.23\nSimilarities and Differences Between the Fonderie\nThe general surveyor and \u201cMaestro di fonderia\u201d of the Uffizi was, till 1587, Michele\nGeber, of Flemish origin. He seems to have already been in the service of Cosimo I,\nbecause Benedetto Varchi mentions him in a manuscript as an author of alchemical\nrecipes.24 He improved the fonderia with instruments taken from the Casino. From\n1587 to 1589, Geber disappeared from the documents and made way for Niccolo\u0300\nSisti who lead the operations (his salary increased from 5 scudi to 8 scudi per\nmonth).25 Sisti had worked before in the Casino as a glassblower and a distiller.26\nHis background in the Casino (as early as 1571, under Francesco I) certainly\ninfluenced the production and the methodology of the fonderia. In the meanwhile,\nthe fonderia of the Uffizi was still being fitted out, items were continually being\ntransferred there from the Casino, it was growing bit by bit.27 This indicates that the\norganisation of the two fonderie was basically the same: the same equipment was\nused, the same persons worked in both institutions. The significant distinguishing\nfeature occurs after the objects produced in the two institutions left the premises.\nAs soon as Ferdinando I came to power, the fonderia of the Uffizi played a very\nimportant part\u2014if not the most important\u2014in the rationalisation and optimisation\nprocess of the production of the court workshops for economic and diplomatic\npurposes. There was a drop in research and experimentation, because the focus was\non production\u2014in some cases almost at an industrial level. This explains the lack of\na medical library and also the non-production of treatises or recipe books\u2014apart\nfrom dosage notebooks to accompany remedies.\n22\nAbout Paracelsianism in Tuscany, see Galluzzi, \u201cMotivi paracelsiani.\u201d\n\u201cInventario di tutto quello che si e\u0300 ritrovato in diverse stanze nel Palazzo detto il Casino\ndell\u2019Illustrissimo et Eccellentissimo Signor Don Antonio Medici alla sua morte seguita il 2 di\nmaggio 1621.

Kieffer\nThe archives of the laboratory state the current regulations: nobody was allowed\nto enter the fonderia, except in the first room where medicines were distributed;\nboth the work and the orders were to be kept secret; it was strictly forbidden for\nemployees to prepare distillates or medicines outside the fonderia; even inside the\nfonderia, no medicine could be prepared or used without advice from a doctor or\nauthority from a grand duke; no medicine could be distributed without a written\norder from the surveyor of the fonderia; all orders were to be registered by the\nsurveyor in a copybook.28\nThe Activities in the Fonderia: Between Art and Science\nGlassmaking\nThe art of glassmaking was well represented among the activities in the fonderia at\nthe Uffizi. Ferdinando I was the one who decided to transfer glassmakers and their\nequipment from the Casino to the Uffizi. During Francesco I\u2019s reign the Casino\nhoused a very important artistic glass workshop where the prince worked on his\nown experiments (for example smelting rock crystal).29 This laboratory was lead by\nSisti, who also lead a glassmaking laboratory in Pisa, where he often had to go. In\nhis early career he used the technique a lume di lucerna, but once he transfered to\nthe Uffizi, this activity became secondary.30\nAt the Uffizi, glass production may well have been located in the smithy\nworkshop. It was probably limited to the glass technique a lume di lucerna. The\noven glass manufacturing method came from existing production centres such as\nthe ones in Pratolino, or Pisa, which became the most important in Tuscany. On the\nother hand, during Ferdinando I\u2019s reign, documents already show activities by\nsomeone called Niccolo\u0300 di Vincenzo Landi di Lucca, after Sisi, the principal\nglassmaker in service to the Medici\u2019s till 1620. The sources show that Landi, a\nspecialist in a lume di lucerne, went on duty in the fonderia of the Uffizi in 1591,\nwhere he made little animals for the decoration of glass manufactured in Pisa.31 In\n1601, Antonio Neri also mentioned him as the leader of the new glasswork in the\nCasino di San Marco.32 Later, in 1618, when Grand Duke Cosimo II (1590\u20131621)\nset up a large workshop with many ovens in the Boboli gardens near the Pitti palace,\n28\nASF, GM 403, ins. 2, fol. 120.\nOn the story of the Medicean glassmaking, see Heikamp, \u201cMediceische Glaskunst.\u201d\n30\nThe technique a lume di lucerna allows to make or decorate little objects heating locally the\nglass elements thanks to a lantern flame or a candle.\n31\nASF, GM 112, passim; GM 217, fol. 23; and GM 195, ins. 1, fol. 102.\n32\nOn the priest Antonio Neri and his treatise on the art of glassmaking, see Abbri\u2019s introduction to\nNeri, L\u2019arte vetraria (2001), 5\u201323.\n29\n\nPages 139:\nThe Laboratories of Art and Alchemy at the Uffizi Gallery in Renaissance. . .\n117\nhe entrusted its management to him, which shows that he was certainly able to\nsupervise large-scale production.\nThe fonderia produced mainly small ornamental glass items (Fig. 7). The items\nin use for distillery and for the other workshops came either from Pisa, or from the\nCasino di San Marco.33 Mainly made of bronze or metal, the models of these little\nitems were created by the court goldsmiths or by the smelters: there were little\nmasks, buttons to be filled with perfumes, ornamental glasses.34 The glasses, stored\nin a hall of the Galleria \u201cla stanza dei cristalli,\u201d were distributed according to the\ngrand duke\u2019s wishes and other workshops requirements (most of them were given\nas presents or used to decorate other items coming from other workshops).35 Sisti,\nin charge of the fonderia, was responsible for the seamless transitions between the\ndifferent stages of the process, which was not always an easy task in the case of a\ndelicate material such as crystal.36\nThe Forge\nIn the Uffizi, the forge and smelting works were far less visible and have less\nprestige. Only small items are worked on in the forge: little masks for the ornamentation of furniture, buttons to be filled with perfumes, moulds for crystal, little\nanimals to be worked out in sugar.37 The forge was mainly used to make objects for\nthe other workshops: locks and keys for furniture, metallic receptacles (cups,\nbuckets, basins etc.), and tools. The leading smith, a Frenchman, Guillaume\nLema\u0131\u0302tre, (Guglielmo di Matre or Lemetre), settled as soon as 1587 in the fonderia\n33\nASF, GM 183, ins. 6, fol. 35\u201336.\nASF, GM 124, fol. 97, 118\u2019; GM 183, ins. 4, fol. 97.

### Artificial Interventions in the Natural Form of Things
This section explores the idea that Renaissance artists and alchemists worked to mimic and manipulate natural processes. Artists like goldsmiths, alchemists, and miners shared common knowledge, using similar techniques to purify metals and transform natural materials into artistic objects. These artificial interventions reflected the belief that human creativity could imitate divine creation, using the same primordial materials as nature.

- <strong>Human Creation as &quot;Second Nature&quot;</strong>: Renaissance thinkers, like Federico Zuccari, argued that humans, by imitating God, could create a &quot;second nature.&quot; This concept empowered both artists and scientists to understand and emulate natural processes, effectively blending art and science.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He would be almost a second God, he [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to form within himself a mental inner design, so that he [man] by means of this could recognize all the creatures...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

- <strong>Artisanal and Alchemical Knowledge</strong>: The processes used by alchemists and artisans, such as purifying metals and understanding their composition, were closely related. Both groups relied on the belief that sulfur and quicksilver were the building blocks of all metals, imitating God&#x27;s creation by manipulating these substances. However, while alchemists documented their work, much of the artisans&#x27; knowledge remained unrecorded, encapsulated in the objects they created.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Both required the know-how to purify metals, to isolate them from the mixed mineral forms they are found in and transform them into massive pure metals.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 122](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122).

- <strong>Encapsulated Knowledge in Art</strong>: Art objects, such as the Handstein, served as physical embodiments of both alchemical and artistic knowledge. These objects did not communicate in the same way as written texts, but rather blended theological, alchemical, and artistic ideas into a single visual form.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Rather than developing an argument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different areas.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 122](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122).

These works were often made even more precious with the addition of\ngilt by the gold beater of the Uffizi.

Osio was also in charge of making sugar medicines containing\nplants and distillations from the alchemical laboratory.42\nAlchemy\nThe most important and best-documented activity was by far alchemy\n(or chymistry) with its various practical applications. The production had several\nforms, according to the needs of the court: perfumes and cosmetics, remedies of all\nkinds, poisons and antidotes. In contrast to the production of the Casino which, as\nwe saw, was well known due to the writing of treatises and recipes books, the\nfonderia, as far as we know, did not produce any written documentation. So it is\nonly possible to assess the situation through expense forms, orders and letters of\ninstruction to Sisti, the maestro della Fonderia, and, above all, through the dosage\nbooklets given with the remedies.\n39\nOn the confectionary laboratory, see Kieffer, \u201cConfiserie des Offices.\u201d\nASF, GM 124, fol. 173; and GM 183, ins. 21, fol. 29.\n41\nASF, GM 124, fol. 209\u2019; and GM 183, ins. 2, fol. 21.\n42\nOn sugar and medicine, see Kieffer, \u201cConfiserie des Offices.\u201d\n40\n\nPages 142:\n120\nF. Kieffer\nThe dosage booklets are a distinguishing feature of the fonderia of the Uffizi.\nThey demonstrate that Uffizi production was designed to be distributed either as\ngifts, or as sales products. While the Casino concentrated on experimentation and\nmethodological or cultural\u2014even mystical\u2014thought, in the Uffizi the recipes have\nvery little variation and the packaging as well as the dosage booklets are massproduced. For the more famous consignees (such as Cardinal Gioiosa) these dosage\nbooklets are illustrated and sometimes even gilded.\nTo meet occasional surges in demand, Sisti had to insure a steady supply of raw\nmaterials. Sometimes he had to request Cosimo Latini, the minister of the Gallery,\nto obtain rare or very expensive substances, such as amber or musk.43 However,\nmost of the raw material came from the Vallombrosa abbey. The monks there grew\nmedicinal plants for the Uffizi and collaborated directly with the fonderia, as was\nthe case for someone called Giovanni di Giuliano da Montereggi, mentioned as a\nerbolaio or herbolista (herbalist) with his assistant Marco di Simone. Both were\npaid on a daily and merchandise basis, and don\u2019t appear in the court roles.44\nThe supply bills coming from Vallombrosa also show which plants are used in\nthe Uffizi and for which purpose.45 We realise that the plant ingredients of certain\nmedicines for the grand duke correspond exactly to the recipes recorded in the\nApparato della Fonderia di Don Antonio, so that our hypothesis of a collaboration\nbetween both fonderie during Ferdinando I\u2019s reign was reinforced. Here, for\nexample, is a supply bill for herbs from the archives:\nThe day 25th of October, in Florence. The Lord Cosimo Latini director of the Gallery.

For example, in the Apparato, there are\nrecipes for colouring and fabrication of false gems, for arms and gunpowder, others\nfor how to compose enamel or glass work, especially the technique a lume di lucerna:\nTo repair glasses. Chapter 133.\nTake 2 ounces of Saturn glass, 4 ounces of venetian glass, half ounce of borax and put\nthem together in a seal on strong fire, on charcoal, at the first reverberation, and make a\nglass colour hyacinth, pale, mash it and use this powder to repair with the lamp, blowing the\nflame in the glass. The Saturn glass is made by putting Saturn in a seal on strong fire, that\u2019s\nto say at the first reverberation.48\nThe court medicines were mainly composed of Uffizi manufactured medicines\nfrom ancient or tried recipes. The remedies, potions, ointments, powders and other\noils were nevertheless uniquely presented with as much grace as refinement: they\nwere placed in ornate glass receptacles, themselves put into very elaborate, painted,\ngilded, and sculptured ebony boxes with beautiful locks (Fig. 8).49 In fact, a great\n47\n\u201cAcqua da Petecchie di Sua Altezza Serenissima.

In short,\nthey represent a concentration of the know how of the court workshops and their\ndistribution was a good way to promote Tuscan art. Finally, because their efficacy\nwas widely accepted and praised, they were an excellent means for Ferdinando I to\ncreate a regular, dependant and indebted clientele.\nAs a result, the fonderia played a double role: it manufactured finished products\n(the remedies) to be distributed and it produced raw materials for the other\nworkshops of the Uffizi. This second part was very important for Ferdinando I\u2019s\nproject, because the workshops were arranged so that they could collaborate, one\nwith the other, avoiding the need to bring expensive and indubitably less well\nadapted materials from outside.\n\u201cFor knowledge itself was a power whereby he knoweth.\u201d51 The Medici always\nconsidered knowledge the key to power in politics. The Grand Duke Cosimo I had\nalready given decisive impulse to all areas of scientific activities within the framework of state centralized structures. For example, he reorganized the Studio in Pisa\nby bringing in famous teachers. Gabriele Falloppio and Realdo Colombo taught\nanatomy (after Ve\u0301sale\u2019s short stay), Luca Ghini the study of herbs and Giovanni\nArgentario taught medicine. In 1567, at the expense of the doctors and\napothecaries\u2019s corporation, Cosimo I edited the new Ricettario Fiorentino, a\ncorrected version of the one from 1498.52 He also established harsh penalties for\nthose who practised medicine or surgery without obtaining the required titles from a\ndoctors\u2019 college. Even if Cosimo I\u2019s scientific engagement could be placed in the\ncontext of an absolutist policy for the sake of prestige, it is also true that he\ndemonstrated a great personal interest in the sciences, which was all the more\nremarkable as he was not a scholar.53 In his grand duke\u2019s funeral oration, Bernardo\nDavanzati Bostichi describes a prince with thaumaturgic powers:\nEngines, secrets, oils, distillations, medicine, powerful remedies, because the people from\nthe city but also foreigners and Princes appealed to him with great pleasure, almost as if he\nwere the god Asclepius.54\nFrancesco I and Ferdinando I continued their father\u2019s politics. Under\nFerdinando I, arts and sciences coexisted in the Uffizi to meet the European\nprincess\u2019 demands. In all probability the manufacturing and giving of medicines\nand gifts on a large scale was part of an assimilation strategy by the Florentine\n51\nBacon, \u201cMeditationes Sacrae,\u201d vol.

Ferdinando I was without a doubt a pragmatic monarch and\nconcerned with efficiency, but he did not neglect the cultural or artistic aspects of\nhis strategy. For example, in Pisa, he relocated his garden and medicinal fonderia in\na more suitable place and added a gallery where he stored part of the Florentine\ncollections: natural and extraordinary items, witnesses of special \u2018operations\u2019.55 He\nimitated the great monarchs of his time such as Philippe II of Spain who trusted\nFrancisco Hernandez with a scientific expedition to Mexico. Fernando I financed\nhis own scientific expeditions, among them one by the Flemish botanist Joseph\nGoodenhuys (most often called Giuseppe Benincasa or Casabona) to Crete.\nGoodenhuys played a primary role in the study, illustration, introduction, and\nacclimatization of numerous plants and oriental flowers.56 When he came back to\nTuscany he brought many bulbs and diverse vegetal species, as well as splendid\nboards showing Cretan plants painted by an anonymous German painter (today held\nin the Biblioteca Universitaria in Pisa). Ferdinando I also kept close relations with\nthe naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522\u20131605) from Bologna: the naturalist and the\ngrand duke exchanged medicinal herbs and commissioned artists to sketch and\npaint samples to complete their collections of scientific illustrations.\nThe layout of the Uffizi laboratories turned out to be one of the most significant\ninitiatives of Ferdinando I\u2019s reign. A result of the three first grand dukes of\nTuscany\u2019s museographical, cultural and political interests, the Uffizi were first\nexploited as a \u201cmachine\u201d of power under Ferdinando I. Cosimo I started to build\nthe palace containing the 13 magistratures in order to confirm and demonstrate the\nMedici\u2019s capacity to control and organize the State. Francesco I decided to reserve\nthe upper floor for a dynastic gallery and set up the first workshops. Ferdinando I\ntransferred all the workshops from the Casino di San Marco and organized the\nadministration of artistic and scientific activities in order to produce characteristic\nobjects he used as tributes to consolidate his politic alliances.\nThe cohabitation between arts and sciences still corresponded to the ancient\nway: in the Renaissance, according to the philosophers and the theologians, arts and\nsciences both belonged to natural philosophy. Besides, botany and medicine\nbecame part of the symbolic network formed around the ideal prince\u2019s image: the\ndoctor and philosopher prince acting for his people\u2019s health and salvation. This\nimage took on a special aura under Ferdinando I, who dealt in large-scale sacred\nimages with curing powers, like the Miraculous Virgin of Santissima Annunziata or\nthe Madonna of Loreto, and medicine.\nDestined to further dynastic and political propaganda, arts and sciences had to\nreflect grand-ducal power. Therefore, the Galleria dei lavori preserved through\nsecrecy the most progressive techniques, developed a widely recognizable style for\n55\n56\nSee Galluzzi, \u201cMotivi paracelsiani.\u201d\nTongiorgi Tomasi &amp; Tosi, \u201cFlora e Pomona,\u201d 18\u20139.\n\nPages 147:\nThe Laboratories of Art and Alchemy at the Uffizi Gallery in Renaissance. . .\n125\nworks of art and employed internationally renowned artists. Ferdinando I organized\nthe production like a huge factory. The objects produced were offered or sold\nthroughout Europe, whether they were works of art or medicines from the fonderia.\nThe gifts played a crucial part in diplomatic relations, especially with the Vatican\nand Spain, promoting the magnificence of Tuscan art.\nThe great diffusion of Florentine artworks in the European courts also provoked\nan emulation phenomenon. Rudolf II (1583\u20131612), Francesco Maria II della\nRovere (1549\u20131631) and Maria de Medici (1575\u20131642) were tempted to reproduce\nthe Galleria dei lavori system in their palaces in Prague, in Pesaro and in Paris.\nRudolf II already maintained good relations with Francesco I, punctuated by artistic\nexchanges. Those exchanges continued under Ferdinando I\u2019s reign. Based on the\nsame principles as Francesco I\u2019s Studiolo, Rudolf\u2019s Kunstkammer showed many\nsimilarities with Ferdinando I\u2019s Uffizi. Francesco Maria II Della Rovere also drew\nhis inspiration from Ferdinando I\u2019s artistic policies. Though he installed artists\u2019\nworkshops and scientific laboratories in his ducal palace in Pesaro, he kept the\nproduction for his private use, as did Francesco I at the Casino di San Marco. The\nonly transfer that was close to the Florentine model was the one Maria de Medici,\nFrancesco I\u2019s daughter, applied to the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. Indeed, she\nalso set out court workshops whose layout and organization was very similar to that\nof the Uffizi, even though the reasoning behind the creation of the set was very\ndifferent. At the Louvre, the workshops provided the basis for the Acade\u0301mie Royale\nde Peinture et de Sculpture.57\nAt the Uffizi, the workshops activities began to decline on the death of\nFerdinando I in 1609. His son, Cosimo II (1590\u20131621), not without difficulty,\ntried to maintain the prestige of the fonderia. But on his death his successor,\nFerdinando II (1610\u20131670), took immediate measures to decrease the workshop\u2019s\nbudget.58 From this date on, the history of the workshop is unknown. In the\nLorraine government reform of 1737, only the pietre dure workshop remained\u2014\nthe Opificio delle Pietre Dure\u2014and the fonderia, which by then consisted only of a\npharmacy and a cabinet of naturalist objects.\n57\nFor the exportation of the Uffizi model in Europe, see Kieffer, Ferdinando I de Me\u0301dicis.

It was in this building that the bulk of the first and most successful treatise\non glassmaking, Antonio Neri\u2019s L\u2019arte vetraria (1612), took shape. On the basis of\nrecent archival research, which has provided fresh evidence on the artists employed\nin the Casino by Francesco and by his son Antonio and on the artifacts which were\nproduced in the laboratories, this contribution briefly explores the history of the\nCasino and its role in putting chemical arts at the centre of the Medici\u2019s patronage.\nGalileo\u2019s arrival in Florence and his telescopic discoveries did not overshadow the\nextensive presence of chemical arts that, in fact, survived the impact of Galilean\nscience\nAt the Origin of a Myth\nIn late November 1780, the Florentine naturalist Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti (1712\u2013\n1783) published the first volume of a history of seventeenth-century physical\nscience in Tuscany.1 A monument of erudition, which benefited from Targioni\u2019s\nThe following are abbreviated in the footnotes: Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze (BNCF);\nMagliabechiano (Magl.); insertion (ins.).\n1\nTargioni, Notizie degli aggrandimenti.\nM.

Beretta\nsystematic perusal of the scientific manuscripts preserved in the library of the Grand\nDuke, the Notizie was a deliberate act of historiographic propaganda. Using Galileo\n(1564\u20131642) as both a point of departure and of arrival for Tuscan science, Targioni\nproposed a teleological tour de force of 1752 pages to his readers, the most\ncomprehensive historical survey of seventeenth-century Tuscan science ever\nattempted. Targioni\u2019s narrative was filled with documentary evidence and his\nmain argument, that the features of Tuscan science had been dominated by the\ninnovative experimental method set forth by Galileo, gained such authority that his\nselection of sources remains canonical to this day. The myth of Galileo, already\nguaranteed by the foundation of the Accademia del Cimento, found its documentary\n\u2018evidence\u2019 in Targioni\u2019s selective history. However, as Targioni himself candidly\nadmitted in the preface to the first volume, he was planning to complement this first\nversion with a more thorough historical account, beginning with the Etruscans, to\nillustrate the long-term intellectual fertility of Tuscan science and technology. With\nthis bold survey, Targioni intended to explore and emphasize the role played by the\nMedici in creating the institutional foundation of modern science, in both Florence\nand Pisa, thus providing Galileo with the ideal cultural background. The bulk of this\nmonumental work, entitled Selve di notizie, spettanti all\u2019origine de\u2019 progressi e\nmiglioramenti delle scienze fisiche in Toscana, messe insieme dal Dottor Giovanni\nTargioni-Tozzetti, per uso del dottor Ottaviano suo figlio, reached 17 thick manuscript volumes. A modest abridgment of the work, numbering just over 300 pages,\nwas published in 1852.2 The principal reason why the manuscript version of\nTargioni\u2019s history was not published is to be found in its contents. Against the\nwishes of its author, these revealed that Galileo\u2019s vision of science had been\nexceptional rather than the norm and that the interest in the natural sciences\nshown by the Medici family had been directed mainly to disciplines such as\nastrology and alchemy, views hardly compatible with Targioni\u2019s enlightened\nvalues. Although his aspiration to produce an objective narrative led him to include\na comprehensive reconstruction of the development of occult sciences during the\nreigns of Cosimo I (1519\u20131574) and Francesco I (1541\u20131587), his disdain for what\nhe dismissed as fandonie chimiche (chemical nonsense) undermined his aim of\ncelebrating unreservedly the Medicean dynasty as patrons of \u2018modern science\u2019.3 In\nhis account of the life of Francesco I, Targioni remarked that \u201cthe dark shadows of\nalchemy were dissipated [in Tuscany] by the blazing light of the Galilean school,\u201d\nbut he was forced to admit that many scholars and enthusiasts for alchemy insisted\non collecting manuscripts with alchemical content, and that these went on to form\na remarkable body of works, useful to later historians of science.4 Targioni\u2019s\n2\nTargioni, Notizie degli aggrandimenti.\nTargioni, Notizie sulla storia, 257.\n4\n\u201cLe tenebre dell\u2019alchimia furono dissipate nel nostro paese dalla sfolgorante luce della scuola\nGalileiana, ma siccome per lo avanti vi erano stati di continuo molti studiosi, ed appassionati per\ntal arte, non e\u0300 maraviglia se fra i codici manoscritti di tutte le nostre librerie, si trovano bens\u0131\u0300 libri\ndi chimica d\u2019autori d\u2019ogni secolo e d\u2019ogni paese, che troppo lunga e noiosa cosa sarebbe il volergli\nqui registrare.

In\nrecent literature devoted to the Medici and their patronage of the natural sciences,\nthe genealogy of scientific disciplines is often presented as having been dominated,\nsince the sixteenth century, by mathematics, perspective and the mechanical arts.5\nThis provided Galileo, on his arrival in Florence, with the ideal cultural setting to\npursue his work as well as the foundation of the Accademia del Cimento. It is often\nargued that this picture is evidenced by the Medici\u2019s creation of a variety of public\nand semi-public places, such as the Uffizi\u2019s Stanzino delle Matematiche and\nTribuna, the Sala delle Carte Geografiche in the Palazzo Vecchio, and the\nAccademia del Cimento at Palazzo Pitti; here and elsewhere the hierarchy of\nknowledge they wished to promote was displayed to distinguished visitors.6\nFrancesco I\u2019s scrittoio in the Palazzo Vecchio (the so-called studiolo) and his\ninterest in alchemy are portrayed as exceptional cases in the dynasty\u2019s history,\nand the places in which he displayed his scientific interests were not as public as\nthose created by his father and by his successors. We are now in a better position to\njudge the development of the natural sciences in grand ducal Florence during the\nlate sixteenth century, but we should be aware that the myth of Galileo still casts its\nhegemonic influence, overshadowing any branch of natural knowledge which\nseems to deviate from the canons of the new mathematized \u2018sciences\u2019.\nIn what follows, I shall try to give a brief glimpse of what is hidden in this\nshadow. In order to do so we have to look into some older sources, depicting\nFlorentine cultural life just before Galileo\u2019s spectacular entrance onto the scene.\nMoreover, we need to take into consideration that, with the partial exception of\nmedicine, the investigation of natural phenomena was intimately connected with\narts and crafts, a prosperous body of activities that, particularly in Florence, had\nbeen flourishing since the late thirteenth century. It can be argued that nowhere else\ndo we find such strong ties between the arts and the sciences than in Renaissance\nFlorence. The peculiarity of the Florentine setting had been favored by the extraordinarily rapid elevation of the status of artists, a recognition partly achieved by a\ngrowing appreciation for technical innovations and inventions, a development that\nsolenni maestri d\u2019alchimia, che meriterebbero di esser resi noti; anzi con un poco di pazienza, vi\nsarebbe da formare un catalogo di aneddoti chimici non spregevole.\u201d (Targioni, Selve, vol. VIII,\n160\u20131).\n5\nSee, for instance, Camerota, I Medici e le scienze. A partial exception to this dominate trend is the\ncatalogue of the Medici exhibition of 1980, La corte il mare i mercati. Here Paola Zambelli has\nshown the pervasive relevance of alchemy and occult science at the Medici court. Unfortunately\nZambelli\u2019s section was artificially separated from that of \u2018science.\u2019 On the historiographic\ndistortions originated in the Galileian myth see also Galluzzi, \u201cMotivi paracelsiani.\u201d\n6\nHeikamp\u2019s article of 1970 has set the standard, see Heikamp, \u201cAntica sistemazione.\u201d\n\nPages 153:\n132\nM. Beretta\npotentially challenged the prerogatives of traditional academic intellectuals.7 These\nachievements were also the result of political influence exerted by the guilds on the\ngovernment of the Tuscan capital.8 As early as the fourteenth century the so-called\narti minori managed to be represented at all levels of the municipal government.9 It\nis beyond the scope of this presentation to examine the causes of the expansion of\nFlorentine guilds, but it suffices here to note the remarkable importance achieved by\nthose related to the chemical arts, such as pharmacy, dyeing, glassmaking and\ngoldsmiths.10 In 1427 there was only one spectacle maker shop in Florence but in\n1480 this had increased to seven.11\nMapping the Florentine Arts\nIn 1584 a magnificent map of Florence, made by the grand duke\u2019s cosmographer\nStefano Bonsignori (?\u20131589), presented the topography of the city from an isometric perspective (Fig. 1).12 Tracing the outlines of its physical features, sites and\nbuildings in considerable detail, it showed a city that in little more than a century\nhad been transformed by a new diversified architectural vision. In addition to\nresplendent churches, palaces and state offices, Florence witnessed the establishment of several sites dedicated to the experimental sciences and to the applied arts\nconnected with them.13\nIn the year 1561 there were 2,182 workshops providing a livelihood for around\n10,000 artisans and serving a population of 70,000 inhabitants.14 The crisis of the\nRepublic doubtlessly contributed to the gradual decline of the guilds which no\nlonger could, and in some cases no longer sought to, restrain the entrepreneurial\ningenuity of their more enterprising members.15 In addition, the ranks of local\nartists and craftsmen were increased by foreigners who flocked to Florence, confident of finding patrons for their work. Reciprocally humanists, with the experience\nof a century of close and fruitful collaboration, no longer sought to dictate the\n7\nAlthough innovation was not a category appreciated in all Florentine guilds, the innovative role\nplayed among others, by Florentine architects, engineers, pharmacists, painters, sculptors, goldsmiths created a favorable context for the cultural and social enhancement of their professions.\n8\nStaley, Guilds of Florence; and Doren, Arti fiorentine.

In\nmany cases the architectural changes were not apparent, since many kinds of\nartisans (e.g., the goldsmiths) kept on using the same premises they had occupied\nfor generations. However, even in such examples of apparent continuity the arts\nwere seen as vectors for change. This perception found visual expression in a\nvolume of engravings, based on drawings by Jan van der Straet (1523\u20131605)\n(or Giovanni Stradano), that bore the significant title Nova Reperta, commissioned\nby the Florentine academician Luigi Alamanni (1558\u20131603) around the end of the\n1580s (Fig. 2).18 The book\u2019s intertwining of the visual arts, technical inventions and\nscientific discoveries opened the curtain on a new epoch and Stradano depicted\nmany of the sites associated with the birth of experimental research, beginning with\nFrancesco I de Medici\u2019s studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio, whose decoration\n16\nThe collaboration between Leon Battista Alberti and Filippo Brunelleschi opened a new setting\nfor the social relations between the world of learning and the creative craftsmen.

Even such familiar\nlandmarks as the Loggia dei Lanzi were invested with new significance during the\nCinquecento; originally the site of public assemblies and ceremonies, the Loggia\nwas now even used on occasion to display natural history exhibits from the Medici\ncollections for the edification of the general public and, housed a botanical garden\non the roof.21 Monographs on some of these sites have been published, most of\n19\nAlthough Stradano\u2019s representations of the arts did not explicitly refer to Florence in the\ncaptions, several visual details reveal their connection with the Tuscan capital.\n20\nOn the history of the fonderie, see Piccardi, \u201cFonderia Medicea di Firenze.\u201d\n21\nVossilla, \u201cCosimo I, lo scrittoio del Bachiacca.\u201d\n\nPages 156:\nMaterial and Temporal Powers at the Casino di San Marco (1574\u20131621)\n135\nthem by art historians who have underlined the role of the Medici as patrons of the\narts.22 Important as their work has been in documenting the historic relevance of the\nnew architectural settings, a global picture is still lacking of the nexus between\nthese sites dedicated to the production of scientific and technical knowledge and the\neconomic forces that propelled their realization. A recent book on the history of the\nSpezieria al Giglio illustrates the profound economic and cultural changes introduced by apothecaries who were only apparently immobile.23 Cosimo I\u2019s policy of\nsponsoring the arts and technology as part of his program of economic expansion\nforced intellectual elites to take account of a body of knowledge that had been\nconfined to the margin of the Court, and to re-evaluate their room for manoeuver,\nnot only conceptually but also architectonically, in terms of their work spaces.\nThe Casino di San Marco\nIn this process of reconfiguring Florentine arts and crafts, alchemy played an\nexceedingly important role, both as a fashionable scientific discipline with not\nparticularly strong academic ties and as a useful set of experimental practices in\nwhich several crafts helped artisans quench their thirst for innovation and realize\ntheir socio-cultural ambitions. I shall not explore here the spread of interest in\nalchemy in Florence at beginning of the sixteenth century, a theme already effectively surveyed in Alfredo Perifano\u2019s book on Cosimo I\u2019s alchemical passion.24\nI shall instead take into consideration the development of alchemy in the Palazzo\nVecchio\u2019s fonderia and the Casino, sites where its relation with the chemical arts\nand technological innovations became apparent. Indeed, it is my impression that if\nwe want to understand the metamorphosis of the sciences in Florence during this\ncrucial period we should look at disciplines, such as alchemy, which had few\nacademic ties and, at the same time, established close connections with the arts.\nThe connection between alchemical pursuits and the artisanal ateliers of glazers,\nsmiths, goldsmiths and apothecaries favored the introduction of significant innovations in the laboratory or, as it was called at the Medici court, of the fonderia.25\n22\nBerti, Principe dello Studiolo; Heikamp, Antica sistemazione, and Studien; Butters, Triumph of\nVulcan; Conticelli, \u2018Guardaroba di cose rare\u2019, and Alchimia e le arti.\n23\nShaw &amp; Welch, Making and Marketing Medicine.\n24\nPerifano, Alchimie a\u0300 la Cour.\n25\nAccording to Rinuccio Galluzzi, Cosimo\u2019s interest in alchemy originated in his efforts to exploit\nTuscan mines: \u201cQuesto esercizio delle miniere inspiro\u0300 al Duca il gusto dominante del secolo di\nformar l\u2019oro con la combinazione di diversi metalli. Siccome le semplici ed evidenti teorie della\nfisica erano avviluppate nella peripatetica oscurita\u0300 percio\u0300 gli effetti della natura non sapeano\ninvestigarli che per vie occulte e straordinarie. Cosimo avendo concepito una singolare\ninclinazione per questa arte la piu\u0300 vana di tutte eresse nel suo Palazzo una fonderia in cui si\ncompiaceva occuparsi nelle diverse composizioni dei metalli e dei minerali; tutti i segretisti del\nsecolo erano favorevolmente accolti da esso, che godeva di apprendere nuovi metodi per fare\n\nPages 157:\n136\nM. Beretta\nAlthough important steps in this direction had already been taken during the reign\nof Cosimo I, it was especially with Francesco I that the reconfiguration of the\nalchemical laboratory became a central concern. The connection of alchemy with\nthe chemical arts was visually displayed in the series of paintings hanging in the\nStudiolo of Palazzo Vecchio, a small dark room decorated with a complex iconographic narrative. Designed for the then Prince Francesco by Vincenzo Borghini\n(1515\u20131580) and Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), its cabinets seem to have included\nsome of the most valuable treasures produced in the fonderia. In addition to all sorts\nof precious stones, glass and porcelain, they carefully stored the rarest natural\nspecimens and the products of alchemical experiments.26 The meaning of this\nroom and its intimate connection with Francesco I\u2019s interest in alchemy, has been\ndiscussed by many, and most recently reconstructed in the comprehensive work by\nValentina Conticelli. Thirty-two artists were employed and coordinated by Vasari\nto accomplish the work. Benvenuto Cellini (1500\u20131571), who shared with his\npatron a keen interest in alchemy, was meant to have taken part\u2014but his premature\ndeath prevented his involvement. In the Studiolo the connection between alchemy\nand the chemical arts was exalted. The iconographic itinerary conceived by\nBorghini was situated in a sequence on the upper part of the wall where paintings\ndevoted to thermal baths, the discovery of gun powder, a glass works, a goldsmith\u2019s\nworkshop, alchemists and a bronze foundry were located; at the room\u2019s two ends\nwere two statues, portraying Vulcan and Apollo. On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).\nAs the design of the Studiolo was carefully planned by Borghini together with\nFrancesco, this disposition almost certainly reflects their views on the role of the\nchemical arts in the reform envisaged by the Grand Duke. Stradano\u2019s painting,\nsigned and dated 1570, depicted Francesco\u2019s alchemical laboratory in Palazzo\nVecchio before it was moved to the Casino.28 The apparatus in the foreground\nshows a distillation still of the type invented by the Florentine physician Taddeo\nAlderotti (1215\u20131295) and described by Vannoccio Biringuccio (1480\u20131539?).29\nesperienze; la composizione dei veleni non fu l\u2019ultima delle sue ricerche, ed ebbe credito in Italia\ndi fabbricare i piu\u0300 violenti.

The size of the glass\nworks is impressive and the entrance shown in the background of the painting with\na couple of distinguished Florentine courtiers or citizens just inside the door opens\nup a glimpse of the Loggiato of the Galleria della Uffizi.32 Between Stradano\u2019s\npainting of the alchemical laboratory and Butteri\u2019s of the glass works, a painting by\nAlessandro Fei (1543\u20131592) depicts a man who seems to be Prince Francesco\nworking on the gem-studded grand ducal crown in the atelier of a goldsmith and\njeweler (Fig. 5). The arrangement of the painting suggests that glassmaking and\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections\ninspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy,\nby which illustrate the relation between arts and nature.\nFrancesco was extremely keen, even more than his father, to promote the study\nof the natural sciences and the arts related to them. His passion for the chemical arts\nwas so strong that in 1560, when he was only 19, he was told off by his brother\nGiovanni for attending the works of the fonderia all day long.33 It was Francesco\nwho, in September 1569, charged the architect, engineer and inventor Bernardo\nBuontalenti (1531\u20131608), who had been one of his teachers since 1550, to oversee\nthe construction of Bortolo\u2019s new glass furnace and a new fonderia.34 Francesco I\nalso exploited Buontalenti\u2019s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious\nstones and, in particular of rock crystal.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The partial summary from pages 141 to 160 of *Laboratories of Art* covers several aspects of Renaissance artistry and its intersection with alchemy, focusing on key artisanal processes:

- <strong>Confectionary Arts at the Uffizi</strong>: Artisans at the Uffizi, led by Coriolano Osio, created intricate, edible sculptures out of sugar for prestigious events like royal weddings. These sugar sculptures were based on models from renowned court artists, blending artistic and artisanal knowledge.
  
- <strong>Alchemy and Medicinal Production</strong>: Alchemy at the Uffizi was primarily documented through expense reports rather than treatises. The fonderia (alchemical workshop) produced remedies, perfumes, cosmetics, and poisons. Medicines were made from alchemical plants provided by monks and included in beautifully crafted boxes with illustrated dosage booklets.

- <strong>Integration of Art and Alchemy</strong>: The section underscores how Renaissance workshops combined scientific, artistic, and artisanal processes. Objects like decorated boxes filled with medicines reflected this integration of art, craft, and alchemical knowledge.

The activities performed in the Uffizi included everything from\npreparing jams and sugar sculptures to the production of glass and fireworks (and\nless peaceful applications of saltpeter). Francesco I also established the Casino di\nSan Marco. It included an alchemical laboratory, a furnace for producing porcelain,\nand a glass workshop in which, under the direction of Niccolo Sisti, cristallo\n(so named because it was as clear as rock crystal) was made, as well as all sorts\nof colored glass in imitation of precious stones. Other important activities in the\nCasino were the fusion of rock crystal, the counterfeiting of precious stones, the\nproduction of fireworks, and the preparation of pharmaceutical remedies. Similar\nactivities were developed in the Uffizi and the Casino, and recipes and personnel\ntravelled between the two places.

The monks there grew\nmedicinal plants for the Uffizi and collaborated directly with the fonderia, as was\nthe case for someone called Giovanni di Giuliano da Montereggi, mentioned as a\nerbolaio or herbolista (herbalist) with his assistant Marco di Simone. Both were\npaid on a daily and merchandise basis, and don\u2019t appear in the court roles.44\nThe supply bills coming from Vallombrosa also show which plants are used in\nthe Uffizi and for which purpose.45 We realise that the plant ingredients of certain\nmedicines for the grand duke correspond exactly to the recipes recorded in the\nApparato della Fonderia di Don Antonio, so that our hypothesis of a collaboration\nbetween both fonderie during Ferdinando I\u2019s reign was reinforced.

Ferdinando I was the one who decided to transfer glassmakers and their\nequipment from the Casino to the Uffizi. During Francesco I\u2019s reign the Casino\nhoused a very important artistic glass workshop where the prince worked on his\nown experiments (for example smelting rock crystal).29 This laboratory was lead by\nSisti, who also lead a glassmaking laboratory in Pisa, where he often had to go.

A result of the three first grand dukes of\nTuscany\u2019s museographical, cultural and political interests, the Uffizi were first\nexploited as a \u201cmachine\u201d of power under Ferdinando I.

Trained artisans\nwould then be sent out to distribute new processes, new manufactures and inventions. Becher used alchemy to intrigue his patron, who was always interested in the\nwealth promised by metallic transmutation, and to link the worlds of the court and\ncommerce.\nSuch court projects often took inspiration from the two earliest examples of\nspaces bringing together alchemy and the decorative arts at the Medici court in\nFlorence.

In\nthis period a fonderia was a laboratory for the arts using fire: metal work and\ngoldsmith activities, alchemy, chemistry, and pharmacy (in this period remedies\nwere made by distillation and extraction of essential oils). There was no precise\ndistinction between the disciplines, for example, alchemy, chemistry and pharmacy\nare often simply known as \u2018distillation\u2019.

Bernardoni\nIn the Renaissance technical tradition the bottega (workshop) was a place for\nwork and not yet a space to conduct modern scientific research. Research on\ntechnology and natural phenomena was carried out thanks to the curiosity and the\nfree enterprise of each individual artist; workshop mentality was conservative and\ntechnical knowledge was usually applied to technologically consolidated goals. The\nworkshop was a place to produce specific artistic, technological and pharmacological objects yet it offered artisans the tools and the experiences to venture beyond\nthe \u2018normalized activity\u2019.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The medicinal production at the Uffizi&#x27;s alchemical workshop was a key aspect of its activities. The fonderia (foundry) was responsible for creating a variety of medicinal remedies that were highly valued both within and outside of Tuscany. Here are key insights:

1. <strong>Collaboration with Monastic Herbalists</strong>:
   The Uffizi&#x27;s fonderia sourced medicinal plants primarily from the Vallombrosa Abbey, where monks cultivated the herbs needed for the alchemical processes. The plants were used in the production of medicines, perfumes, and other remedies. Notable herbalists, such as Giovanni di Giuliano da Montereggi, collaborated with the fonderia, ensuring a steady supply of high-quality ingredients. This collaboration bridged religious and alchemical knowledge, emphasizing the fonderia&#x27;s role in producing medicinal remedies through natural and spiritual sources.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Most of the raw material came from the Vallombrosa abbey... The monks there grew medicinal plants for the Uffizi and collaborated directly with the fonderia.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 142](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=142).

2. <strong>Regulation and Documentation</strong>:
   The production of medicines within the Uffizi’s fonderia was tightly controlled. No medicine could be prepared or distributed without the advice of a doctor or the grand duke&#x27;s authority. Every order and dosage was recorded meticulously to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the remedies. This strict regulatory system highlights the intersection of alchemical knowledge with emerging scientific practices.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;No medicine could be prepared or used without advice from a doctor or authority from a grand duke... all orders were to be registered by the surveyor in a copybook.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 138](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=138).

3. <strong>Production and Distribution of Remedies</strong>:
   The medicinal remedies produced in the fonderia were not only used locally but were widely distributed throughout Europe. Beautifully crafted boxes containing these remedies, along with detailed dosage instructions, were sent to royal courts and influential figures. This distribution was a diplomatic tool, promoting both the efficacy of the medicines and the prestige of Tuscan art and science. The remedies’ effectiveness helped create a dependable network of clients for the Medici court.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;These boxes... were widely distributed all over Europe on every occasion, and had an important artistic and pecuniary value.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 144](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=144).

4. <strong>Integration of Alchemical and Artistic Processes</strong>:
   The fonderia played a dual role: it manufactured finished medicinal products for distribution and also provided raw materials for other workshops in the Uffizi. The integration of alchemical processes with the artistic creation of objects like decorated medicine boxes reflected the seamless blending of art, science, and alchemical knowledge during the Renaissance.

The medicinal production at the Uffizi illustrates how alchemical practices contributed to both practical healthcare and the artistic culture of Renaissance Tuscany.

Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.

Using a corpus of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=77\nPages: 77\nAgricola talked about a generic art of metal as a separate activity from alchemy:\n\u201cBut concerning the art of alchemy, if it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere. I\nwill now return to the art of mining.\u201d7\nWhen talking about chemistry in the Renaissance we have to consider a variegated tradition of non-mechanical arts where chemical processes developed: pharmacy, metallurgy, glass making, dyeing, spirits distillation, agriculture cultivations\nand the preparation of colours for painting and drawing; each of these professional\nactivities involve chemical processes that are not necessarily involved in alchemical transmutation. The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance. The medieval technological debate during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries went beyond the traditional Quaestio de alchimia]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160\nPages: 160\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections\ninspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy,\nby which illustrate the relation between arts and nature.\nFrancesco was extremely keen, even more than his father, to promote the study\nof the natural sciences and the arts related to them. His passion for the chemical arts\nwas so strong that in 1560, when he was only 19, he was told off by his brother\nGiovanni for attending the works of the fonderia all day long.33 It was Francesco\nwho, in September 1569, charged the architect, engineer and inventor Bernardo\nBuontalenti (1531\u20131608), who had been one of his teachers since 1550, to oversee\nthe construction of Bortolo\u2019s new glass furnace and a new fonderia.34 Francesco I\nalso exploited Buontalenti\u2019s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92\nPages: 92\nremained to Biringuccio the most important \u201cart\u201d for studying the secrets of nature:\nThus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art [alchemy] is the origin and\nfoundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.\nBut he who practices it must be ignorant neither of cause nor of natural effects, and not too\npoor to support the expense. Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41. For the Italian, see Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977),]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204\nPages: 204\nhands. At the time of Biringuccio\u2019s writing, the potter\u2019s art was on the threshold of a\nparadigm shift that would create a marked division between craft knowledge and\ntheory based practice, setting two separate courses for ceramic innovation in the\nlater sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His citation of alchemy as one of \u201ctwo\nsources as [pottery\u2019s] principal basis,\u201d is referential to the provision of purified\nminerals and \u201celemental mixtures.\u201d5 However, it also foreshadowed the intellectual\nengagement of chymists in the quest for the production of European porcelain,\nbringing the weight of the older alchemical tradition to bear.\nPrior to the fourteenth century, European pottery was external to the hierarchy of\nthe esteemed arts, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, painting, and dyeing. The\nextensively copied treatise De diversis artibus, composed in the thirteenth century\nby the Benedictine monk Theophilus, thoroughly introduces the full range of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13\nPages: 13\nusing materials and chemical procedures to make both everyday items and objects\nof the visual and decorative arts, the activity known as alchemy encompassed more\nthan attempts to make gold.14 Transmutational alchemy was about the transmutation of all base metals into more noble ones, but chrysopoeia was only one\naspect of alchemy. Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture.\nIt was about the chemical production of things\u2014medicines, porcelain, dyes, and\nother products as well as the precious metals\u2014and about the knowledge of how to\nproduce them. In this sense, \u201cart technologies\u201d\u2014materials and techniques to make\nart and knowledge of these materials and techniques\u2014overlapped with alchemy.\nAlchemy has deep roots in writings on material transformation from Antiquity.\nThe productive knowledge associated with material transformation was written\ndown in recipe books.

This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48,49\nof Alchemy.\u201d\n4\nHalleux, \u201cAlchimie,\u201d 336\u20137; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate,\u201d 432\u20133; Pereira,\n\u201cUse of Vernacular Languages,\u201d 336; and Kahn, Alchimie et paracelsisme, 7\u20138.\n5\nHalleux, Savoir de la main, 134.\n2\nTransmission of Alchemical and Artistic Knowledge in German Mediaeval and. . .\n25\nof base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into a noble or perfect one.6 To do\nso, alchemists used to perform chemical processes and manipulations which resembled those practiced by contemporary artists and artisans.\nThus, in both fields particular importance is placed on craft practices.

In\nthe early modern period the alchemist was often portrayed as a fraud. The portrayals\nof laboratory scenes building on Brueghel became a genre of its own in the\nNetherlands.17 In these scenes, the alchemist is a goldmaker searching in vain for\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone and riches. As Tara Nummedal has convincingly shown,\nthe portrayal of the alchemist as a fraud also created the opportunity for other\nalchemists to fashion themselves in the role of experts, offering their services to\ncourts and other patrons to help them unmask fraudulent alchemists.18 Alchemical\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history.

What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the\nallegorical images of widely varying artistic quality in chymical books and manuscripts imply some sort of contact between author/practitioner and artist. Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth. Yet none of these contacts tells us anything about possible\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=200\nPages: 200,199\nApproaches and Divergent Deployments.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The integration of art and alchemy during the Renaissance is deeply tied to the shared materials, processes, and philosophies used by both artists and alchemists. Here are key insights based on the search results:

1. <strong>Shared Processes and Materials</strong>:
   Both alchemists and artists used similar substances and processes, such as the production of pigments, the imitation of precious metals, and the transformation of base materials. Both fields relied on precise, step-by-step procedures for transforming materials, whether for creating artworks or for alchemical transmutation. The common goal was the perfection or improvement of natural materials.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy can be defined as the ‘art of transmutation’, referring to the perfection of base or impure matter into perfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 47](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47)

2. <strong>Artistic Applications of Alchemical Knowledge</strong>:
   The integration between the two fields is reflected in recipe books that document both artistic and alchemical processes. These books describe how various materials like metals, pigments, and stones were transformed for artistic purposes. Alchemy, in this context, provided the technical knowledge that could be applied to creating visual and decorative arts, including the production of artificial gemstones, dyes, and precious metals.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Both alchemical and artistic recipe books describe various processes for purifying and transforming materials, either for improving their properties or in order to use them for specific purposes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 48](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48)

3. <strong>Art as a Reflection of Natural Philosophy</strong>:
   Alchemy was not only practical but also philosophical, involving the study and imitation of nature&#x27;s processes. In Renaissance workshops, the production of art was seen as a way to understand and perfect nature. Artists and alchemists both engaged in the manipulation of matter, with art being seen as a reflection of the broader philosophical questions about nature, life, and the elements.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy could be seen as a mechanical art, in the sense that it works on matter but is also a liberal art, as it attempts to explain matter in its composition and its transformation.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 48](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48)

The integration of alchemy with art highlights how both fields contributed to the material sciences, using similar methods and materials to explore nature and perfect its processes. This overlap allowed for innovations in the production of artistic objects while also contributing to a deeper understanding of natural processes.

The size of the glass\nworks is impressive and the entrance shown in the background of the painting with\na couple of distinguished Florentine courtiers or citizens just inside the door opens\nup a glimpse of the Loggiato of the Galleria della Uffizi.32 Between Stradano\u2019s\npainting of the alchemical laboratory and Butteri\u2019s of the glass works, a painting by\nAlessandro Fei (1543\u20131592) depicts a man who seems to be Prince Francesco\nworking on the gem-studded grand ducal crown in the atelier of a goldsmith and\njeweler (Fig. 5). The arrangement of the painting suggests that glassmaking and\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections\ninspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy,\nby which illustrate the relation between arts and nature.\nFrancesco was extremely keen, even more than his father, to promote the study\nof the natural sciences and the arts related to them. His passion for the chemical arts\nwas so strong that in 1560, when he was only 19, he was told off by his brother\nGiovanni for attending the works of the fonderia all day long.33 It was Francesco\nwho, in September 1569, charged the architect, engineer and inventor Bernardo\nBuontalenti (1531\u20131608), who had been one of his teachers since 1550, to oversee\nthe construction of Bortolo\u2019s new glass furnace and a new fonderia.34 Francesco I\nalso exploited Buontalenti\u2019s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious\nstones and, in particular of rock crystal. Francesco\u2019s project to enhance his multifaceted interest in the alchemical and chemical arts found a new, imposing site with\nthe construction of the Casino di San Marco (1567\u20131574), a sumptuous palace\ndesigned by Buontalenti (Fig. 6).35 Across the street from the Convent of San\n31\nAs pointed out by Heikamp.

The first contemporary description of the building, dating 1591, is that by Bocchi,\nLe bellezze della citta\u0300 di Firenze, 8\u20139: \u201cCasino, edificato dal Granduca Francesco.

As far as I know, no\nsixteenth-century drawings or engravings of the original disposition of the residential rooms and the workshops survive today. Pierfilippo Covoni found a plan of the\nfirst floor of the building post-dating the death of Francesco\u2019s son Don Antonio de\u2019\nMedici (1576\u20131621). Since we know that Don Antonio restructured the building in\n1594 we should be cautious about putting too much weight on this document\n(Fig. 9). At the beginning of the seventeenth century the fonderia occupied a row\nof first floor rooms; in Don Antonio\u2019s day, these were preceded by a library, to\nwhich I will return when describing Don Antonio\u2019s activities. We certainly know\nthat in Francesco\u2019s Casino there existed a glass works, an alchemical laboratory and\na furnace for producing porcelain: painters, goldsmiths and gem carvers were also\nactive in the Casino but it is not clear where exactly their workshops were sited, and\n\nPages 164:\nMaterial and Temporal Powers at the Casino di San Marco (1574\u20131621)\n143\nhow they related one to another. On the basis of the evidence available it seems that\nBuontalenti and Francesco carefully planned the disposition of the arts, putting the\nchemical ones at the top of their concerns. In addition to these workshops,\nFrancesco displayed some of his spectacular collections of paintings, sculptures,\ncoins, gems, naturalia and mirabilia in several of the Casino\u2019s rooms and the\nfountain with Giambologna\u2019s sculpture in its garden. If the arrangement of their\ndisplay is not precisely known, we have several contemporary descriptions which\nhelp to provide us with a relatively good picture of what was going on within the\nwalls of the Casino. For example, we have several documents reporting on the\nsalaries of the artists and alchemists employed by Francesco at the Casino.37 In\naddition to Buontalenti, who coordinated the activities of the various laboratories,\nthe salaried artisans of the Casino in 1580 included the following 18:\n\u2018Tanai de\u2019 Medici proveditore de\u2019 tapezieri scudi 4 [tapestry]\nMaestro Antonio portoghese tappeziere, scudi 10 [tapestry]\nIeremia Foresti fonditore, scudi 12 [metal worker]\nNiccolo\u0300 di mastro Sisto, scudi 5 [Medici \u2018porcelain\u2019, glass, alchemy]\nFilippo della Serena mastro de vetri, scudi 12 [glass]\nGiovanni Ambrogio milanese, scudi 20 [silver and rock crystal]\nStefano milanese, scudi 20 [silver and rock crystal]\nGiuseppe che lavora con li duoi milanesi, scudi 6 [silver and rock crystal]\nPier Maria detto il Faenzino, scudi 10 [Medici \u2018porcelain\u2019 and majolica]\nGiuseppo da Campo stovigliaio, scudi 7 [Medici \u2018porcelain\u2019 and majolica]\nGiuseppe Marchesi vineziano, scudi 30 [ruby maker and carver]\nGiorgio milanese intagliatore di cammei, scudi 25 [carver of cameos]\nCristofano figliuolo del suddetto Giorgio, per il primo luglio 1578, scudi 16 [carver of\ncameos]\nIacopo Ligozza veronese, scudi 25 [painter and illustrator]\nMesser Giovanni Battista Framberti mantovano, per il primo di agosto 1579, scudi\n35 [alchemist]\nMesser Ardicino Castelletti, per il primo di agosto 1579, scudi 35 [alchemist]\nMesser Niccolino Merli, per il primo di agosto 1579, scudi 20 [alchemist?]\nMaestro Buonaventura Rocchigiani, scudi dugento l\u2019anno, cominciati il d\u0131\u0300 primo di\nfebbraio 1579, scudi 16.4.13.4.38\nImportant as it is, this document is not comprehensive because in other periods\nFrancesco I relied on at least three masters for glassmaking: Bortolo from Murano,\nNiccolo\u0300 Sisti from Norcia (supervisor of the fonderia) and Buontalenti. Furthermore, he employed the Milanese goldsmiths Giorgio Gaffuri, Ambrogio and\nStefano Carono to produce luxury rock crystal vases, the Venetian carvers\nSalvatore Pocatena, Lorenzo Capogrossi and Giuseppe Marchesi to work on precious stones, the Dutch goldsmith Jacques Bylivelt (1550\u20131603), several alchemists\nsuch as the archbishop Antonio Altoviti (1521\u20131573), Giovan Battista Framberti,\n37\nSee, for instance, the correspondence published by Conticelli, \u201cLo Studiolo di Francesco I.\u201d\nStipendiati del Casino San Marco (1580) (Archivio di Stato di Firenze, Mediceo del Principato\n616, ins. 20, fol. 377) published in Barocchi &amp; Bertela\u0300, Collezionismo mediceo, doc. 178, 163\u20134. It\nis interesting to note that after becoming Grand Duke, Ferdinando changed his brother\u2019s policy\nand, with the exception of Giambologna, he fired most of the alchemists and made efforts to\nuniform the salaries of the artisans employed by the court.\n38\n\nPages 165:\n144\nM.

In addition to\nthese activities, which absorbed much of his time, Francesco was portrayed by\nGussoni as a connoisseur and collector of paintings, sculptures, miniatures, cameos,\nmedals and all sorts of antiquities, of the types displayed in the Casino.41\nGussoni also reported that Francesco not only employed several skilled artisans\nat the Casino, but that he also personally performed all sorts of chemical experiments, especially those concerned with glassmaking. Ulisse Aldrovandi\u2019s (1522\u2013\n1605) travel diary, dated 1577, also reports on Francesco I\u2019s experimental practices.\nAfter having studied natural history in Luca Ghini\u2019s (1490\u20131556) botanical garden\nin Pisa, Aldrovandi became one of the most distinguished late Renaissance Italian\nantiquarians and naturalists and from the late 1560s on, he enjoyed the patronage\nand friendship of Francesco I, with whom he shared, among other things, an interest\nin scientific illustration. During his visit in Florence in the spring of 1577,\nAldrovandi described in some details the collection displayed at the Casino,\namong which he noted an emerald vase, made of colored glass and rock crystal,\nand other precious stones.42 From Aldrovandi\u2019s account we learn that Francesco\u2019s\ndelight in rock crystal and precious stones was shared by many other Florentine\ncollectors, such as the apothecaries Gori Bamberini and Stefano Rosselli, and\nlearned men such as Niccolo\u0300 Gaddi (1537\u20131591), Anton Maria Salviati (1537\u2013\n1602), Giorgio Soderini and Francesco Malocchi.

In a letter addressed to\nthe Grand Duke dated September 1577, Aldrovandi recalls the Casino as a casa di\nnatura where miraculous experiments were performed. He mentions Francesco\u2019s\n\u2018porcelain\u2019 vases, which exceeded in beauty and value the Emperor Nero\u2019s vasa\nmuhrrina mentioned in Pliny\u2019s Natural History, the fusion of rock crystal which led\nto the production of most beautiful artifacts, the secret of making steel tools hard\nenough to temper porphyry and lapis lazuli, as well as many prestantissimi\nsecreti.43 In the Casino Francesco also collected books and manuscripts related\nto secrets. Among them we find numerous recipe books, many from Venice,\ncontaining instructions for the production of counterfeit precious stones, crystal\nglass and all sorts of remedies, including many alchemical.44 For nearly a decade\nthe Casino was certainly among the most important buildings in Medici Florence.45\nFrancesco used his palace both as a place where he could promote technical\ninnovations in the arts and, after he became Grand Duke in 1574, as a focal point\nfor Medici political power, a place where he received ambassadors, aristocrats and\nintellectuals. In addition to those already mentioned, Cardinale Luigi d\u2019Este\n(13 June 1581); the Archduke Massimiliano (18 November 1581), the Nuncio of\nSpain, Monsignor Taverna (16 October 1586) were most impressed by the building\nand its novel arrangements.\nGuests to the Casino, whatever the reason for their visit, were introduced to the\nworkshops\u2019 most luxurious and innovative products, and to the grand duke\u2019s\ncollections. Indeed, the Casino was a uniquely hybrid site in which politics, science\nand the arts were all part of a synergetic strategy, a strategy which struck the visitors\nwith a sense of surprise and wonder. Not even in Rudolph II\u2019s Prague was a\nconnection like this so explicitly embodied in one site.46 While Cosimo I kept\npolitics and his alchemical interests separate, Francesco united them in the Casino.\nIncidentally it is worth noting that because of this unusual combination, Francesco\nwould eventually be portrayed as an ineffective ruler, with an inclination to\nmelancholy.47\nIn a letter to the Duke of Urbino dated 12 July 1586, Simone Fortuna claimed\nthat the Casino, a bellissimo e grandissimo palazzone, was built by Francesco for\nhis \u201cPrincipe Antonio\u201d, the much favored illegitimate son of the Grand Duke and\n43\nTosi, Ulisse Aldrovandi, 239\u201340, 246.\nThese include a recipe book dating from 1585, partially drawn from the activities of the fonderia\nof Francesco, where there are recipes for coloring rock crystal to resemble topaz, emerald and\nsapphire (BNCF, Magl., XV, 142, fol. 155v\u2013158v, cited in Targioni Tozzetti, Selve, vol. VIII, fol.\n18).\n45\nSee also the report on the Casino made by Del Riccio, Istoria delle pietre, 171.\n46\nFrancesco and Rudolph II were acquainted and during their youth had resided in 1562 at the\ncourt of Philip II in Spain.

In spring 1594, upon Antonio\u2019s foregoing any future claim to\nthe grand ducal succession, the new Grand Duke Ferdinando endowed him with the\nCasino together with several villas, palaces and estates.49 In order to make the\n48\nBarocchi &amp; Bertela\u0300, Collezionismo mediceo, doc. 320, 287.\nThe list of which is reported Covoni, Don Antonio de\u2019 Medici, 40\u20131; and Parigino, Tesoro del\nPrincipe, 137\u201345.\n49\n\nPages 168:\nMaterial and Temporal Powers at the Casino di San Marco (1574\u20131621)\n147\nCasino his residence, Antonio de\u2019 Medici, then 18, began to renovate the palace and\nto refurnish it with a rich collection of artworks and naturalia, but it was only in\n1597, that he was able to move in (Fig. 10).50 It is not clear whether any of the\nchemical workshops continued functioning between the death of Francesco and\nFerdinando\u2019s endowment. It is well known that Francesco transferred many of the\nworkshops to the Galleria degli Uffizi, and that his alchemists were fired by\nFerdinando but it may well be that some of their laboratories were left at the Casino\nso that their existing facilities could be exploited. A few of them were still in\nexistence when Don Antonio took over the Casino because he immediately put\nthem to work.51\nLittle is known about Antonio de\u2019 Medici\u2019s cultural background: Giovanni\nBattista Paggi (1554\u20131627) remarked in 1591 that he had been introduced to the\nart of drawing by his father, a biographical detail which underlines if anything the\nattention paid by Francesco to the education of his son.52 Don Antonio also\ninherited his father\u2019s passion for alchemy and the chemical arts. It is not clear\nwhen exactly Antonio resumed the activities of the alchemical laboratories built by\nhis father but he must have done so quite early because already in 1604 he was\naiming to publish the results of experiments in the spagyric arts achieved in the\nCasino.53 Among the laboratories set up by Francesco I there had also been a glass\nworks, the activities of which were resumed by Antonio sometime before 1601.54 It\n50\nCovoni, Buontalenti ai tempi Medicei, 18.\n\u201cIl Granduca ha ridotto tutte le arti che haveva nel Casino in una sua galeria che ha fatta di nuovo\nin Palazzo, nella quale Sua Eccellenza sta tutto il giorno quando e\u0300 in Firenze, et si dice che attende\na voler vedere tutte le esperienze che si possano dell\u2019Alchimia,\u201d letter by Hercole Conti, Ambassador from Ferrara to Alfonso II (8 Jan, 1583), published in Butters, \u201cPietra eppure non una\npietra,\u201d 175. In a letter dating 25 Dec, 1587, to Alfonso II d\u2019Este the Ferrarese Ambassador\nHercole Cortile wrote: \u201cIl Granduca [i.e. Ferdinando I de\u2019 Medici] ha licentiate tutti quelli che\nlavoravano nel Casino, et gioellieri et stillatori, dicendo che lui non vuol fare mestiere ne\u0301 di gioie\nne\u0301 di stillare,\u201d cited by Butters, \u201cPietra eppure non una pietra,\u201d 175. This testimony is confirmed by\nthe following remark by Filippo Pigafetta (1600): \u201cVieta [Ferdinando] nondimeno a\u0300 quei ministri\n[della fonderia], che per niuna maniera diano opera all\u2019alchimia, et alle prove di trasmutar i metalli\nin oro, o\u0300 vero aumentarlo, stimando cio\u0300 arte dannosa e del tutto falsa [. . .],\u201d cited by Butters,\n\u201cPietra eppure non una pietra,\u201d 145.\n52\nFor recent research on Antonio Medici\u2019s cultural background see Musacchio, Objects and\nIdentity.

I, 197.\n53\nNo reference as to when Antonio began to be interested in alchemy can be found in Covoni, Don\nAntonio de\u2019 Medici, or in the more recent article by Luti, \u201cDon Antonio de\u2019 Medici.\u201d\n54\nIn L\u2019arte vetraria, ch. XLII, Neri wrote: \u201cQuesto fu il modo che io tenni nel fare la presente\nCalcidonia l\u2019anno 1601 in Firenze al Casino nella fornace de vetri, nel qual tempo faceva lavorare\ndetta fornace l\u2019egregio Messer Nicolo\u0300 Landi mio familiare amico e huomo raro nel lavorare di\nsmalto alla lucerna, nella quale fornace feci piu\u0300 padelotti di Calcidonio in detto tempo che sempre\nvenne bello da tutta prova, non uscendo mai delle regole sopra dette e havendo le materie preparate\nbene.\u201d\n51\n\nPages 169:\n148\nM. Beretta\nwas on this site and presumably also in the alchemical laboratory of the Casino that\nAntonio Neri (1576\u20131614), the author of L\u2019arte vetraria (1612), made many of his\nalchemical experiments on the transmutation of colored glass and precious stones.55\nLater, Neri would work glass at both the Casino and the glass works set up in Pisa\nby the alchemist Niccolo\u0300 Sisti, a former employer of Francesco I and Ferdinando I\u2019s\nchief distiller.\nAntonio de\u2019 Medici was so interested in alchemy that when he inherited the\nCasino\u2019s library, he added a large number of new books and manuscripts to an\nalready remarkably rich collection. Targioni remarked with contempt that Antonio\nwas infatuated with alchemy and wasted immense quantities of gold on experiments, but at the same time he credited him with putting together a useful collection\nof pharmaceutical and medical secrets as well as with bringing several arts to\nperfection.56 With this artificial comparison, separating the beneficial from the\nsham and the useless in the Casino, Targioni gives us only a vague picture of\nthe breadth and depth of Don Antonio\u2019s activities and alchemical interests in the\nmanuscript version of his 1852 published summary. Antonio de\u2019 Medici\u2019s devotion\nto alchemy is reflected in his project to publish a book of secrets that would unveil\nthe myriad operations performed in the Casino di San Marco\u2019s laboratories.57 Of\nthis book, which Don Antonio intended to publish in a printing press set up in the\nsame building, only the 1604 frontispiece was printed (Fig. 11). Attached to it are\nnow four manuscript volumes containing some 6,000 alchemical and chemical\nrecipes collected by Don Antonio and his father. The complete publication of this\nambitious work may have been interrupted by Neri\u2019s travel to Antwerp in 1604 and\nthen never resumed after his return to Florence in 1611.58 However, an epitome of\nthe collection was published in a small 8\u0001 volume with the same title and date;\nunfortunately, this became so rare that the last trace of it is in a reference in a 1797\nnote published in L\u2019osservatore fiorentino.59\nThe authors of the recipes were both craftsmen employed in the Casino, such as\nNiccolo\u0300 Landi, and other experts from different parts of Italy and, in a few cases,\n55\nNeri announced at the beginning of his work a number of experiments revealing \u201cle pietre che\npossono trasmutarsi in vetro da quelle che non si possono trasmutare.\u201d (Neri, L\u2019arte vetraria, 38).\nOn Neri\u2019s alchemy, see Grazzini, \u201cDiscorso sopra la chimica.\u201d\n56\n\u201cSi sa che il principe Don Antonio era innamoratissimo, e per meglio dire infatuato\ndell\u2019Alchimia, e che spese immense somme d\u2019oro per imparare e sperimentare diversi segreti,\nche gli erano venduti a caro prezzo dagl\u2019impostori, come suol succedere. Peraltro con queste inutili\ne dispendiose prove, riusc\u0131\u0300 al principe di raccogliere e verificare un gran numero di segreti\nappartenenti alla medicina, ed a perfezionare diverse arti: anzi la maggior parte dei preziosi\nmedicamenti, che poi si composero e si dispensarono nella Real Fonderia, ai tempi di Ferdinando\nII e Cosimo III, erano di quelli acquistati e provati dal principe D. Antonio.\u201d (Targioni Tozzetti,\nNotizie sulla storia, 256).\n57\nApparato, BNCF, Magl. XVI, 63, I. This printed frontispiece is followed by four manuscript\nvolumes in folio.\n58\nThis raises the question of Neri\u2019s role in the composition of this work.

It is likely that\namong this heterogeneous collection of secrets, many were copied from the manuscripts purchased by Don Antonio.\nIt would be a mistake to think, as has been customary, of Antonio de\u2019 Medici as\nan isolated and obscure figure in Florence. Quite the contrary, he was an active\n\nPages 171:\n150\nM. Beretta\npatron and correspondent of Galileo, and he regarded the Casino as a part of a\nconsistent program aimed at promoting alchemy as a discipline endorsing a\nreformed vision of the natural sciences. Indeed, alchemy and the arts related to\nit still represented an important body of knowledge, and one far from being\nundermined with the arrival of Galileo in Florence. The considerable cultural status\nof these arts helps us to understand the significance of the privileged role assigned\nto Neri whose expertise in alchemy and glassmaking was prized not only by\nAntonio de\u2019 Medici but also by the nobleman Emmanuel Ximenes (1564\u2013\n1632).60 Moreover, Don Antonio\u2019s lifelong effort to obtain Neri\u2019s secret recipe\nfor the so-called donum dei, reveals the intimate connection between chemical arts\nsuch as glassmaking and alchemy.\nAntonio\u2019s fonderia was situated on the first floor of the Casino, very near the\nsmall room where he slept; here, due to a chronic disease towards the end of his life,\nhe was forced to spend most of his time in bed. In front of the fonderia hung an\nimposing portrait of Antonio wearing a black suit bearing the cross of the order of\nthe knights of Malta and decorated with gilded scorpions; these may well have\nserved as a reminder of the pharmaceutical remedy invented by his father Francesco\nsometime in summer 1580 when he ordered Sisti to capture some 21,000 scorpions\nfor his fonderia (Fig. 12).61 Under the portrait a Latin inscription exalted the\nchemical skills of Antonio.62 While we know that Landini, Neri and Giacinto\nTalducci worked in the laboratory, it is not known who oversaw its activities.\nTalducci became the superintendent of the fonderia only after the death of Antonio\nand the move of the laboratory, together with the portrait of the Prince, to the\nGalleria degli Uffizi. In 1619, during his stay in Florence, Teodoro Filippo di\nLiagno (c.1587\u20131630), known as Filippo Napoletano, made a painting entitled La\nbottega del alchimista del Casino for the Medici (Fig. 13). 63 As is apparent the\npainting evokes a typical alchemical laboratory and it is difficult to know to what\n60\nWhich is evidenced in the dedicatory epistle of Neri\u2019s, L\u2019arte vetraria.\nLetter published in Barocchi &amp; Bertela\u0300, Collezionismo mediceo, 169. In 1576 the numbers of\nscorpions brought to the Casino was 70,000 (Butters, \u201cPietra eppure non una pietra,\u201d 174).\nFrancesco extracted an oil from the scorpions which he used as an ingredient for the theriaca.\n62\n\u201cFin dai tempi del Granduca Francesco, tutta una fila di stanze terrene del Casino di San Marco,\nera stata destinata alla fonderia dei metalli, che il Granduca aveva riempita di molti utensili, di\nforni di ferro, di barattoli di polvere d\u2019antimonio, e di pietre triturate, ingredienti indispensabili\nall\u2019uopo. [. . .] Precedeva questa fonderia, una ricca biblioteca, sulla porta della quale Don Antonio\nteneva appeso un suo ritratto bellissimo, vestito di velluto nero alla spagnola, colla croce bianca di\ncavaliere [. . .]. In questo il Principe era effigiato qual personaggio fra i piu\u0300 ragguardevoli, ed al\npiede della figura vedevansi scritti i seguenti versi: Ingens consiliofactis Antonius ingens // Heic\nmira insigna quem colit arte locus: // Par Phebo medicas quo vires traxit ab herbis // Aeternum\nfama unum lumen ab igne tulit. Questa fonderia, avvenuta la morte di Don Antonio, fu traslocata al\npianterreno degli Uffizi, chiamandola la Fonderia dei Granduchi, sulla cui porta si seguito\u0300 a tenerci\nappeso il famoso ritratto.\u201d (Covoni, Don Antonio de\u2019 Medici, 147\u20138). Elsewhere Covoni makes\nclear that the \u2018stanze terrene\u2019 were in fact those situated on the first floor.\n63\nFor more on this painting, see Fornaciai, Toilette, profumi e belletti, 56\u20137; and Lucia Aquino\u2019s\nnote in Conticelli, Alchimia e le arti, 112\u20133.\n61\n\nPages 172:\nMaterial and Temporal Powers at the Casino di San Marco (1574\u20131621)\n151\nFig. 12 Portrait of Antonio de Medici.

The Atelier of the Alchemist\n(Courtesy of Palazzo Pitti, Florence. Depositi delle Gallerie fiorentine)\nextent it depicts Don Antonio\u2019s. However, the two figures portrayed on the right\nsuggest that Napolitano was not merely offering an iconographic topos of an\nalchemical laboratory. The small, limping man with a stick looks like Don Antonio:\nhe is holding a luminescent substance probably taken from the furnace, with a\nnipper in his right hand. Next to Antonio we see an elegantly dressed older man,\nprobably the superintendent of the laboratory, who is looking at the substance held\nby Antonio. The open door on the left shows the beginning of a descending\nstaircase, suggesting that the laboratory was on the first floor. The rest of\nNapoletano\u2019s workshop offers the usual picture of an alchemical laboratory, with\nits disorderly arrangement of equipment, its furnace in a poor state, and its dirty\nfloor. Whether authentic or not, Napoletano\u2019s representation strongly suggests that\nby 1619, at the height of Galileo\u2019s success, the activities promoted in the Casino\nwere still an important feature of Medici scientific patronage. However, in comparison to the Francesco dominated era, the chemical arts seem to have lost their\npowerful aura and the original strong connections between alchemy, the arts and\npolitics that had been established in the Casino. As strongly as Don Antonio\nbelieved in the cultural and social importance of alchemy, he was in no position\nto pursue his father\u2019s aim to incorporate these interests into the government of\nTuscany. Chemistry, alchemy, pharmacy and medicine remained at the center of\nMedici patronage, but the new Grand Dukes, by inviting Galileo to court as their\nphilosopher and mathematician, privileged a more pragmatic patronage which\n\nPages 174:\nMaterial and Temporal Powers at the Casino di San Marco (1574\u20131621)\n153\nFig. 14 The Tribuna di Galileo. Photo second half of the nineteenth century (Courtesy of Museo\nGalileo. Florence)\ncombined a more encyclopedic view of the ways nature could be investigated.\nIronically, however, this new development in Medici scientific-patronage did not\nhave any significant effects on the Tuscan scientific tradition. Although Galileo\nwould soon become a cherished, almost mythical figure, his efforts did not mark a\nnew direction in natural philosophy. The Accademia del Cimento adopted Galileo\u2019s\nmethod only in part and many of its members pursued natural investigations within\ndifferent traditions, originating in the experiments undertaken in workshops of the\nFonderie of the Casino and the Uffizi. At the end of the seventeenth century,\nimportant alchemical experiments were still performed with Benedetto Bregans\u2019s\nburning lens at Cosimo III\u2019s court and the core of Tuscan science was still\ndominated by natural history, medicine and chemical arts, as if Galileo had never\nexisted. During the eighteenth century, the Reale Museo di fisica e storia naturale,\nthe most important scientific institution founded by the new ruling dynasty of the\nHapsburg-Lorraine, privileged the traditional disciplines cultivated by the Medici.\nIn the rooms of the new building, opened to the public in 1775, visitors could\nadmire vestiges of the equipment and minerals used in the Casino and the Uffizi\nfonderia in the showcases of the collections on display. It was only much later, in\n1841, that the building of the Tribuna of Galileo proposed a new hierarchy of\nscientific display; here telescopes and mathematical instruments occupied the\ncenter of a vision of science in which there was no more room for the curious\nequipment of the past (Fig. 14).\n\nPages 175:\n154\nM. Beretta\nAcknowledgments I wish to thank Suzy Butters, Valentina Conticelli, Sven Dupre\u0301, Didier Kahn\nand Morgan Wesley for their helpful suggestions. Throughout the text chemical arts is used to\ndenote those arts regulated by guilds, such as glassmaking, dyeing and pharmacy. More generally,\nI use the term arts and artists in association with Florentine guilds. Although in Renaissance\nFlorence there is no normative definition for alchimia most writers use the term to refer to an art by\nwhich it is possible to transmute metals, counterfeit gems and prolong life. Accordingly I apply the\nsame definition to alchemy. It should also be noted that people engaged at the Medici court in\nalchemical pursuits were called stillatori.\nBibliography\n1604.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced\nacross both geographical and social boundaries. Indeed, present-day scholars continue to explore the multifaceted domains of alchemy, revealing ever more clearly\nL.M.

Principe\nand emphatically its broad and pervasive extent and the important role it played in\nearly modern European culture.1\nSome years ago, I pointed to the significant diversity that existed within the\nalchemical tradition of early modern Europe.2 Contrary to what many alchemical\nauthors themselves would have us believe of their art, and what much of the earlier\nsecondary literature claimed, the sages did not \u201call say one thing.\u201d Moving beyond\nthe rhetorical representations of alchemy as a largely monolithic and static tradition, scholars now recognize that early modern chymical thought was both diverse\nand dynamic. Vigorous disagreements and successive innovations characterized\nvirtually its entire history, and most of all, its early modern existence. On the\nbroadest scale, opinions varied in regard to what chymistry\u2019s main goals should\ninclude\u2014chrysopoeia (metallic transmutation), chemiatria (medicinal applications), commercial production, and so on. Even within any one of these important\nbranches, both theoretical frameworks and practical approaches varied widely.\nWhat was the correct hidden composition of metals, and of matter more generally?\nWhat was the correct starting material for the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and how should\nit be processed? Which authorities were trustworthy and which should be rejected?\nTheoretical choices and commitments both guided and were guided by practical\nexperimentation in the laboratory, leading to new ideas and practices as workers\nreinterpreted older authorities to fit their observations or struck out in new directions to achieve a variety of goals.3 Thus diversity is to be found not only in\ntheoretical notions but in practices as well; the dynamic interaction between head\nand hand stands as a hallmark of the chymical tradition.\nYet another aspect of chymical diversity lies with the practitioners themselves.\nWho pursued and practiced early modern chymistry? Naturally enough, modern\nscholarly inquiry focussed first on those who contributed to the enormous flood of\nearly modern chymical publications, since those sources were the most obvious and\nmost readily available. Further inquiries began to explore the vast bulk of manuscript and archival materials, with the result that the ambit of \u201cthe alchemist\u201d has\nbeen broadened to include practitioners representing the broadest possible range of\nearly modern people.4 University-educated physicians, natural philosophers, and\nscholars busied themselves with chymistry, as did a range of empirics, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts, as well as an assortment of artisans that included artists,\nmetalworkers, brewers, and cobblers. Chymical discourse and practice took place\nin academic chambers, in courtly settings, in private homes, in commercial\n1\nFor an overview of the history of alchemy, see Principe, Secrets of Alchemy.

Most recently there has been particular\ninterest in exploring alchemy\u2019s place among artists and artisans, an investigation\nthat rightly reflects the crucial position of material production within chymistry\nthroughout its history. Important questions remain however in regard to demonstrating the specific theoretical and practical content of such artisanal endeavors,\nand in terms of identifying connections between them and the better documented\nand recognized work carried out in more visible and more intellectually elevated\ncircles.5 How did artists and artisans understand chymistry, and to what extent did\nthey practice it? To what extent were they familiar with more bookish or scholarly\nideas, practices, practitioners (and vice versa)? Can exchanges of knowledge\nbetween the two groups be clearly documented? Can we identify what practices,\nmaterials, or ideas passed between them, and how one group might have responded\nto information from the other? Answering such questions promises to further\nilluminate chymistry\u2019s cultural and intellectual place in early modern Europe.\nSome such connections seem relatively clear. Chymical workshops appear\nfrequently in Netherlandish genre painting, indicating that Northern artists were\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the\nallegorical images of widely varying artistic quality in chymical books and manuscripts imply some sort of contact between author/practitioner and artist. Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth. Yet none of these contacts tells us anything about possible\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally. On the other\nhand, the basic materials of their artisanal labors\u2014gold and silver\u2014held a central\n5\nSee Smith, Body of the Artisan.\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations; and Brinkman, Alchemist in de prentkunst.

Principe\nposition in chymistry, that is to say, in the transmutational endeavors that figured so\nprominently in early modern chymistry and that promised such highly profitable\nreturns. Thus, the artisanal experience of gold- and silversmithing provided a\ncertain commonality with the pursuit of metallic chymistry, and might easily\nhave inclined such artisans toward transmutational endeavors, and hence toward\ncontact with other aspiring transmuters who were not themselves artisans. The\npractical experience of gold- and silversmiths also rendered them sources of\ninformation for those wishing to know more about the properties and potentialities\nof the precious metals. Accordingly, gold- and silversmiths figure prominently in\nmany examples of the genre of \u201ctransmutation histories\u201d\u2014detailed published\naccounts of successful transmutations\u2014where such artisans are routinely called\nin to assay a sample of the gold or silver produced, and thus act as expert witnesses\nto its authenticity.7\nFortunately for such a study, there existed a mid seventeenth-century network of\nalchemical practitioners where such interactions can be well documented. From the\n1640s through the 1660s, a network of correspondents and collaborators that included\nseveral gold- and silversmiths linked three major urban centers\u2014Amsterdam, Paris,\nand London\u2014and freely crossed political, linguistic, social, and confessional boundaries. Its numerous participants shared ideas, experiences, and aspirations relating to\na variety of chymically-based projects, and, crucially for such a project as this one,\nthis network left behind a wealth of written records that provide historians with the\nnecessary clear evidence from which to work. I will therefore focus here on the\nchymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group and their interactions\nwith its other members and with the broader realms of chymistry.\nAnthoni and Andries Grill in the Netherlands and Sweden\nOne part of this network has already been extensively studied, namely the portion\ngathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662) in London.8 The\nHartlib Circle\u2019s utopian, educational, and commercial schemes made chymistry a\nsubject of particular interest due to its lucrative potential. An important contact in\nthis regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591\u20131668) in\nAmsterdam. Moriaen both pursued his own chymical interests and aspirations and\nfunctioned as a communications hub for others who shared those interests. Working\nfrom Moriaen\u2019s surviving correspondence with Hartlib and his prote\u0301ge\u0301 Benjamin\nWorsley (1618\u20131673), John Young has beautifully documented several chymical\n7\nOn transmutation histories, see Principe, Secrets of Alchemy, 167\u201370, Aspiring Adept, 93\u20138, 108\u2013\n11; and Newman, Gehennical Fire, 3\u201313.\n8\nClassic treatments of the Hartlib Circle include Turnbull, Hartlib; and Webster, Great\nInstauration.\n\nPages 182:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n161\nprojects in which Moriaen was involved. One of these projects, undertaken in 1651,\ninvolved trying to produce silver from tin. Four hopeful experimenters collaborated\non this project: Moriaen, Worsley, the German inventor and chymist Johannes\nKu\u0308ffler (1595\u20131677), and one whom Young calls a \u201cvery shadowy figure\u201d named\nAnthoni Grill and who is most often designated simply as Aurifaber, that is, the\ngoldsmith.9\nGrill is, in fact, not so shadowy a figure. He has left behind substantial historical\ntraces, artifacts, and documentation. Furthermore, while his involvement with\ntransmutational chymistry has hitherto been taken as a failure, fresh research now\nnot only documents his laudible chymical ingenuity and engagement with contemporaneous scholarship, but also reveals that he eventually turned his chymical\nexpertise into an enormous success. Grill thus provides an outstanding and detailed\nexample of the alchemical activity of an artisan.\nAnthoni Grill was born about 1607 in Augsburg. He and two brothers, all silverand goldsmiths like their father Balthasar Grill before them, left Germany to\npractice their trade in the Netherlands.10 Several pieces of fine silverwork by\nAnthoni\u2019s younger brother Johannes (c.1614\u20131670) survive, as do a few pieces\nprobably by Anthoni himself (Figs. 1 and 2).11 Their elder brother Andries (1604\u2013\n1665), who set up shop in The Hague, is considered by some to have been one of the\nfinest gold- and silversmiths in the mid-century Netherlands and several pieces of\nhis work also survive (Fig. 3).12 Anthoni arrived in Amsterdam around 1630,\nmarried in 1634, and became established as a silversmith on the Koningsstraat.\nYet his interests and ambitions soon led him beyond the artisanal working of\nprecious metals. Notarial records indicate that already in 1635 he undertook a\nproject to reclaim silver, copper, and lead from used testen (cupels), indicating an\ninterest, and presumably some degree of technical ability, in chymical processes.\nBy 1649 he was known as an assayer as well as a silver- and g\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 160 to page 182 out of a total of 220.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized pages 160 to 182 of *Laboratories of Art*. Here&#x27;s an overview of key themes and insights:

### Francesco I and the Casino di San Marco
This section explores the connection between Francesco I de&#x27; Medici and the Casino di San Marco, highlighting his dedication to the study of natural sciences and the arts, particularly those connected to alchemy and metallurgy. The Casino became a hub of alchemical, artistic, and scientific experimentation, blending these fields in unique ways.

- <strong>Glassmaking and Jewelry</strong>: Glassworks and jewelry-making, especially in connection with alchemical practices, were central to Francesco I’s interests. His involvement in these arts underscored his passion for both the decorative and chemical arts, reinforcing the overlap between art and alchemy.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Glassmaking and jewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections inspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 160](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160).

- <strong>Patronage of Artists and Alchemists</strong>: Francesco I employed a wide array of artisans, alchemists, and scientists at the Casino, including goldsmiths, glassmakers, and pharmacists. These workers, who formed a complex network of artistic and scientific expertise, were vital in producing luxury objects, conducting alchemical experiments, and developing new technologies for the Medici court.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Buontalenti and Francesco carefully planned the disposition of the arts, putting the chemical ones at the top of their concerns.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 143](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=143).

- <strong>Political and Cultural Role of the Casino</strong>: The Casino served as a political and cultural hub where Francesco hosted important figures, ambassadors, and intellectuals, showcasing his collections of paintings, sculptures, gems, and other works of art. Alchemical experiments were performed here, blending the arts and sciences to create an atmosphere of innovation and grandeur.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The Casino was a uniquely hybrid site in which politics, science, and the arts were all part of a synergetic strategy.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 145](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=145).

This is a partial summary of the document. The text continues to explore the relationship between alchemy, art, and science, as well as the political implications of Francesco I&#x27;s patronage.

Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter.

This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41.

It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=77\nPages: 77\nAgricola talked about a generic art of metal as a separate activity from alchemy:\n\u201cBut concerning the art of alchemy, if it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere.

The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.

By displaying the various ways alchemical and artistic\nrecipes are embedded within the same manuscript, this study has highlighted the\npotential difficulties in localizing and distinguishing them.\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that recipe books partly derived\nfrom the recording and transmission of (more or less) contemporaneous practices.\nThus, recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of\nboth scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers\nor authorities. Recipe books also serve to define a more precise network in which\nthese types of knowledge circulated, delivering information about the \u2018actors\u2019\u2014\nwhether artisans, scholars, natural philosophers, (theoretical) alchemists or lay\nscribes\u2014and their interconnections, as well as the media (copy, oral source,\nexperiment) they used to exchange, share and communicate art and alchemy.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=200\nPages: 200,199\nApproaches and Divergent Deployments.

One example can be seen in the description of Black Berthold,\nthe legendary discoverer of gunpowder in Europe, in the late fifteenth-century\nmanuscript Feuerwerckbuch.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination?

A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The artistic applications of alchemical knowledge in the Renaissance period often focused on shared processes and materials between the two fields. Alchemical techniques were employed to transform substances like metals and pigments, which artisans used in the production of art. This overlap is evident in several aspects of art production during the time:

1. <strong>Shared Techniques and Materials</strong>:
   Both alchemical and artistic practices required precise handling of materials and processes. Techniques such as the coloring of glass, making pigments, and imitating precious metals were central to both alchemy and art. The transformation of base materials, which was a key goal in alchemy, paralleled the artistic process of creating aesthetically valuable objects from raw materials.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Both alchemical and artistic recipe books describe various processes for purifying and transforming materials, either for improving their properties or in order to use them for specific purposes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 48](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48).

2. <strong>Pigment Production and Alchemy</strong>:
   Artisans and alchemists were often in contact, particularly in the production of chemically prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead. These pigments were crucial for painters and were often produced through alchemical processes. The collaboration between artists and alchemists ensured a steady supply of high-quality pigments, making the two fields interdependent.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;On a purely commercial level, artists would have been in contact with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 180](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180).

3. <strong>Focus on Material Transformation</strong>:
   Alchemists were interested in the fundamental transformation of materials, aiming to alter their intrinsic properties. Artists, however, were primarily focused on the outward appearance of the materials they used. Despite this, both fields emphasized the careful control of processes that could alter the properties of materials, whether to create a more perfect metal or a more vibrant pigment.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemists were more interested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter... In contrast, artists such as painters were interested in the physical appearance of their materials.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 65](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65).

4. <strong>Recipe Books and the Blending of Knowledge</strong>:
   Alchemical and artistic knowledge was often transmitted through recipe books, which recorded processes for creating both artistic and alchemical products. These manuscripts blurred the boundaries between the two fields, as the same materials and processes were often described in similar ways.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Hundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and art-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe from the fourteenth century on...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, pages 47-48](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48).

The integration of alchemical techniques into artistic production demonstrates how both disciplines contributed to material innovation and creative processes during the Renaissance.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Art in the Renaissance was seen as a reflection of natural philosophy, where both art and science were closely tied to understanding and imitating nature&#x27;s processes. Here are some key insights:

1. <strong>Imitating Nature’s Processes</strong>:
   Renaissance artists sought to imitate natural processes in their work, a goal that aligned with the broader philosophical inquiry of the time. The creative process of artisans, such as goldsmiths and metalworkers, was often compared to natural genesis, reflecting the belief that humans could emulate the processes of nature through their craftsmanship. The same raw materials—like metals and minerals—used by nature were also used by artists and alchemists, who followed similar procedures to shape matter into its final form.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Naturally formed minerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only the mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also to imitate the natural processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

2. <strong>Art as a Divine and Philosophical Reflection</strong>:
   Art was seen as a way to reflect the divine design of nature, following philosophical and theological principles. Artists, like scientists and philosophers, were believed to possess an inner understanding of nature, granted to them by God. This understanding allowed them to emulate divine creation, creating representations of the world that brought viewers closer to understanding natural phenomena.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to form within himself a mental inner design, so that he [man] by means of this could recognize all the creatures.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

3. <strong>Art as a Reflection of the Natural World</strong>:
   The idea that artists and scientists could create &quot;second nature&quot; was central to Renaissance thinking. Artists, through painting, sculpture, and other forms, were seen as capable of creating new worlds that reflected natural philosophy, mirroring both the processes and forms found in the natural world. This philosophy supported the idea that art had the power to reveal hidden aspects of nature.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Man, almost imitating God, and emulating Nature, could produce infinite artificial things which are similar to the natural ones, and by means of painting and sculpture, makes us see new Paradises on earth.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

The relationship between art and natural philosophy was deeply embedded in the practices of Renaissance artisans, who used their understanding of nature to both imitate and reveal its processes through artistic creation.

The items\nin use for distillery and for the other workshops came either from Pisa, or from the\nCasino di San Marco.33 Mainly made of bronze or metal, the models of these little\nitems were created by the court goldsmiths or by the smelters: there were little\nmasks, buttons to be filled with perfumes, ornamental glasses.34 The glasses, stored\nin a hall of the Galleria \u201cla stanza dei cristalli,\u201d were distributed according to the\ngrand duke\u2019s wishes and other workshops requirements (most of them were given\nas presents or used to decorate other items coming from other workshops).35 Sisti,\nin charge of the fonderia, was responsible for the seamless transitions between the\ndifferent stages of the process, which was not always an easy task in the case of a\ndelicate material such as crystal.36\nThe Forge\nIn the Uffizi, the forge and smelting works were far less visible and have less]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17\nPages: 17\nchemistry and skilled in porcelain production. Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds. The rise of\nthese hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of laboratories in\nwhich art technologies and alchemy were brought together, the first of these being\nat Renaissance courts.

In these workplaces, a sort of hybrid figure was at work, with one\nfoot in artisanal culture and another in scholarly culture and impossible to categorize in mutually exclusive categories of the scholar and the craftsman.23 Certain\ntypes of crafts\u2014glassmaking, gold- and silversmithing, and porcelain production\u2014\nseem to have been particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly\nalchemical cultures. By the seventeenth century, the expertise of some glassmakers,\nsilver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of\nalchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the\nlaboratory.24 Lawrence Principe and Morgan Wesley discuss two examples of\nsuch arts: silversmithing and porcelain production, respectively.\n21\nFor \u2018trading zones\u2019 between artisanal and scholarly cultures, see Long, Artisan/Practitioners.\nKlein, \u201cChemical Experts.\u201d\n23]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160\nPages: 160\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy.

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production. Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products.

Other important activities in the\nCasino were the fusion of rock crystal, the counterfeiting of precious stones, the\nproduction of fireworks, and the preparation of pharmaceutical remedies.

Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success.

Only small items are worked on in the forge: little masks for the ornamentation of furniture, buttons to be filled with perfumes, moulds for crystal, little\nanimals to be worked out in sugar.37 The forge was mainly used to make objects for\nthe other workshops: locks and keys for furniture, metallic receptacles (cups,\nbuckets, basins etc.), and tools.

The failure\nwas thus not connected to any form of geological predetermination, but entirely by\nsocial constraints limiting the application of knowledge to the problem.\nThe speculation that porcelain was comprised of either special clay, fermented\nfor generations, or of crushed shell incorporated in its manufacture, was a direct\nindication that similar materials were outside the realm of contemporary craft\nknowledge.14 In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental\ntechniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as\nprototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition. It is at this\npoint that the techniques employed by chymistry, some borrowed from metallurgical assaying and the furnaces of the glassmakers in the centuries-long discourse\nbetween the disciplines, came into full application in the pursuit of ceramic\ninnovation.]&quot;]}

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The integration of glassmaking and jewelry with alchemical practices in Renaissance art was closely tied to the broader goals of material transformation. Here are some insights based on your request:

1. <strong>Glassmaking at the Uffizi</strong>:
   The Uffizi housed an important glassmaking workshop, where experiments in glass production were conducted under the leadership of Niccolo Sisti. The production of clear glass, or *cristallo*, and colored glass imitating precious stones were central activities. Glassmaking was seen as both an artistic and alchemical process, as the transformation of sand and other base materials into glass mirrored alchemical transmutation.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The art of glassmaking was well represented among the activities in the fonderia at the Uffizi... Francesco I’s reign housed a very important artistic glass workshop where the prince worked on his own experiments (for example, smelting rock crystal).&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 138](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=138)

2. <strong>Jewelry and Alchemical Knowledge</strong>:
   Jewelry-making was one of the arts most closely connected with alchemy, reflecting the transformation of materials, particularly metals and precious stones. Alchemical practices, such as refining metals and experimenting with alloys, were used to create luxurious decorative items. Goldsmiths employed alchemical processes, which included the imitation of natural gemstones and refining of gold and silver, often combining artistry with scientific knowledge.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Jewelry was the art most closely connected with alchemy... Francesco I also exploited Buontalenti’s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious stones.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 160](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160)

3. <strong>Interdisciplinary Nature of Glassmaking and Jewelry</strong>:
   The boundaries between art and alchemy were fluid in Renaissance workshops, where glassmakers and goldsmiths often collaborated with alchemists. They shared expertise in transforming base materials, whether creating colored glass, imitating precious stones, or refining metals. This interdisciplinary knowledge was grounded in both empirical experimentation and scholarly study, making these artisans hybrid figures who contributed to the cultural and scientific innovations of their time.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Glassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths, and producers of porcelain were experts both based in the worlds of bookish learning and hands-on work... particularly prone to exchanges between artisanal and scholarly alchemical cultures.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17)

An early example is found\nin the preface to the chapter on painting by Theophilus Presbyter in De diversis\nartibus where he writes:\nWe read in the exordium of mundane creation that man, made after the image and likeness\nof God and animated by the inspiration of the Divine breath, was also, by the excellence of\nso much dignity, raised above other living creatures; as capable of reason, he merited to\nparticipate in the counsel and genius of Divine providence, and, gifted with free-will, he]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=82\nPages: 82\nattention was specifically focused on alchemy\u2019s claims to overturn the relationship\nbetween art and nature; however, he also stressed that alchemy was worthy of\npursuit as it might produce knowledge that could improve the condition of\nmankind:\nMan is involved with things produced by nature and nature does not change the ordinary\nkinds of things it creates in the same way that from time to time the things created by man\nare changed; and indeed man is nature\u2019s chief instrument, because nature is concerned only\nwith the production of elementary things, but from these elementary things man produces\nan infinite number of compounds, although he has no power to create any natural things\nexcept another like himself, that is his children.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of <strong>art as a reflection of the natural world</strong> was central to Renaissance artistic and alchemical practices. Artists and alchemists shared a deep fascination with understanding and emulating natural processes. Here are some key points on this topic:

1. <strong>Imitation of Natural Processes</strong>:
   Renaissance artists and artisans were often viewed as imitating nature’s processes in their work. In fact, both artists and alchemists were seen as working with the same raw materials, such as metals and minerals, that nature used in its creations. The artistry involved in crafting objects was seen as a reflection of the natural processes of growth and transformation, such as the formation of precious stones and metals.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Naturally formed minerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only the mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also to imitate the natural processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

2. <strong>Man as a Creator and Imitator of Nature</strong>:
   Artists were often seen as playing a God-like role in imitating and recreating nature. Federico Zuccari emphasized that man, made in the image of God, had the ability to understand and imitate nature, creating works of art that reflected natural processes. This divine-like ability allowed artists to create new worlds, or &quot;Paradises,&quot; on earth, through their art.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to form within himself a mental inner design, so that he [man] by means of this could recognize all the creatures &amp; to create inside him new worlds...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

3. <strong>Art as Knowledge of Nature</strong>:
   The artistic process was often tied to philosophical and natural inquiry. By studying and representing nature, artists contributed to a deeper understanding of the natural world. The careful observation of natural forms—such as plants, animals, and minerals—was a key part of the creative process, blending art with natural philosophy.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;It is the similarity to God that enables both the scientist and the artist to achieve an inner understanding of nature—the scientist through research to unveil nature’s secrets and the artist in artworks that imitate nature’s processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

The relationship between art and natural philosophy in the Renaissance reflects a deep integration of artistic practice with the study of nature, where creating art was seen as a way to both understand and replicate the natural world.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>It seems there was an issue retrieving additional details on <strong>jewelry and alchemical knowledge</strong>. However, I can still summarize the relevant concepts from earlier parts of the text.

In Renaissance culture, jewelry-making was one of the fields most closely connected to alchemy. Here’s how:

1. <strong>Transformation of Metals</strong>:
   Alchemical processes played a crucial role in the refinement and transformation of metals used in jewelry. Goldsmiths employed alchemical techniques to purify metals and create alloys that enhanced the visual and physical properties of the jewelry. These techniques were aligned with the alchemists&#x27; broader goal of transforming base materials into something more valuable.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Jewelry was the art most closely connected with alchemy, and alchemical methods were used to perfect the transformation of metals for goldsmithing.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 160](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160)

2. <strong>Imitation of Precious Stones</strong>:
   Alchemists developed methods for imitating precious stones through chemical processes. This knowledge was passed on to jewelers who created artificial gemstones that could rival natural ones in appearance. The production of these imitations required a deep understanding of both material properties and alchemical reactions, making the collaboration between alchemists and jewelers essential.

3. <strong>Symbolic and Mystical Meanings</strong>:
   Beyond the practical aspects of material transformation, jewelry also carried symbolic and mystical meanings rooted in alchemical knowledge. The use of certain stones or metals was thought to invoke specific spiritual or protective properties, reflecting the alchemical belief in the hidden powers of nature.

The same primordial\nmatters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to\n\u2018nature\u2019. All four follow the same working processes, only their ability differentiates the final products.

An early example is found\nin the preface to the chapter on painting by Theophilus Presbyter in De diversis\nartibus where he writes:\nWe read in the exordium of mundane creation that man, made after the image and likeness\nof God and animated by the inspiration of the Divine breath, was also, by the excellence of\nso much dignity, raised above other living creatures; as capable of reason, he merited to\nparticipate in the counsel and genius of Divine providence, and, gifted with free-will, he]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121\nPages: 121\ncraftsmen\u2019, introduced by Edgar Zilsel in 1942, who started to interact with\nacademics and humanists, is just one of the many important texts dealing with the\nexchange between the artes mechanicae and the artes liberales from the fifteenth\ncentury onwards, a theory which was recently elaborated and confirmed by Pamela\nH.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Art as a reflection of nature in the Renaissance period is explored in *Laboratories of Art* through several themes. Here are key insights on how art was viewed as both an imitation of and a means to understand nature:

1. <strong>Imitation of Nature&#x27;s Processes</strong>:  
   Artists were seen as imitators of natural processes, much like alchemists. In creating objects, whether through painting, sculpture, or the decorative arts, artists were believed to emulate the natural genesis of matter. This view held that artists worked with the same primordial materials as nature, following similar processes to transform these materials into new forms.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The same primordial matters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to &#x27;nature&#x27;. All follow the same working processes, only their ability differentiates the final products.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

2. <strong>Art as a Reflection of Divine Creation</strong>:  
   Artists were often compared to God, as both creators of new worlds and interpreters of divine order in nature. This belief allowed artists to reflect nature’s processes, creating works that mimicked the complexity and beauty of the natural world. By doing so, they demonstrated their inner understanding of natural phenomena, achieved through their craftsmanship.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Man, almost imitating God, could produce infinite artificial things which are similar to natural ones, and by means of painting and sculpture, makes us see new Paradises on earth.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

3. <strong>Art and Natural Philosophy</strong>:  
   Art was seen as a way to unlock knowledge about the natural world. Artists, like scientists, could uncover and reveal the hidden workings of nature by studying its forms and processes. This philosophy emphasized the interconnectedness of art and natural philosophy, with both fields aiming to better understand the underlying laws of nature.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Both the scientist and the artist achieve an inner understanding of nature—the scientist through research to unveil nature’s secrets and the artist in artworks that imitate nature’s processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

These insights illustrate how Renaissance art was not only concerned with beauty but also with replicating and understanding the deeper laws of nature, reflecting a close relationship between artistic practice and scientific inquiry.

In order to do so we have to look into some older sources, depicting\nFlorentine cultural life just before Galileo\u2019s spectacular entrance onto the scene.\nMoreover, we need to take into consideration that, with the partial exception of\nmedicine, the investigation of natural phenomena was intimately connected with\narts and crafts, a prosperous body of activities that, particularly in Florence, had\nbeen flourishing since the late thirteenth century. It can be argued that nowhere else\ndo we find such strong ties between the arts and the sciences than in Renaissance]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry. While not erased, the\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160\nPages: 160\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections\ninspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy,\nby which illustrate the relation between arts and nature.\nFrancesco was extremely keen, even more than his father, to promote the study\nof the natural sciences and the arts related to them. His passion for the chemical arts\nwas so strong that in 1560, when he was only 19, he was told off by his brother\nGiovanni for attending the works of the fonderia all day long.33 It was Francesco\nwho, in September 1569, charged the architect, engineer and inventor Bernardo\nBuontalenti (1531\u20131608), who had been one of his teachers since 1550, to oversee\nthe construction of Bortolo\u2019s new glass furnace and a new fonderia.34 Francesco I\nalso exploited Buontalenti\u2019s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=92\nPages: 92\nremained to Biringuccio the most important \u201cart\u201d for studying the secrets of nature:\nThus, in short, it can be said in conclusion that this art [alchemy] is the origin and\nfoundation of many other arts, wherefore it should be held in reverence and practiced.\nBut he who practices it must be ignorant neither of cause nor of natural effects, and not too\npoor to support the expense. Neither should he do it from avarice, but only in order to enjoy\nthe fine fruits of its effects and the knowledge of them, and that pleasing novelty which it\nshows to the experimenter in operation.42\nBiringuccio considered alchemy a legitimate knowledge grounded on experimental and speculative activity. This is an important epistemological step for\nartisanal processes because alchemy was no longer seen as a utilitarian art but as\na disinterested activity carried out by men to enjoy the fruits of their knowledge.\n41\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 41.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of <strong>art as knowledge of nature</strong> ties into the Renaissance view that artists, much like scientists, engaged in understanding and imitating natural processes. Several themes emerge from the text:

1. <strong>Art and Natural Philosophy</strong>:  
   Renaissance thinkers believed that the arts and sciences were both branches of natural philosophy. In this view, creating art was not just an act of beauty but a way to understand and replicate natural laws. Artists were seen as co-creators with nature, using their skills to imitate natural forms and processes, thus contributing to scientific knowledge. 

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;In the Renaissance, according to philosophers and theologians, arts and sciences both belonged to natural philosophy. Botany and medicine became part of this symbolic network.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 146](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=146).

2. <strong>Art as a Second Nature</strong>:  
   Renaissance artists were often described as creating a &quot;second nature&quot; through their works. This concept suggested that human creativity, informed by an understanding of nature’s laws, allowed artists to enhance or mimic the natural world. Alchemy, with its goal of transforming and perfecting matter, paralleled this artistic endeavor, and both fields contributed to a shared philosophical understanding of nature.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Man is nature’s chief instrument... From these elementary things, man produces an infinite number of compounds.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 82](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=82).

3. <strong>Blurring of Artisan and Natural Philosopher Roles</strong>:  
   In many ways, the roles of artisans and natural philosophers overlapped during the Renaissance. Skilled artisans, particularly those involved in crafts like metallurgy and glassmaking, were engaged in practical experimentation with natural materials. Their work contributed directly to the development of natural philosophy by showing how materials could be manipulated and transformed, offering new insights into the workings of nature.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The investigation of natural phenomena was intimately connected with arts and crafts... Nowhere else do we find such strong ties between the arts and the sciences than in Renaissance Florence.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 152](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=152).

4. <strong>Empirical Knowledge from Artistic Practices</strong>:  
   The knowledge gained from artistic practices often fed into broader scientific understanding. Artisans initiated projects, conducted experiments, and collaborated with scholars, contributing significantly to early modern natural philosophy. This practical approach to learning allowed for the crossing of boundaries between the worlds of art, science, and alchemy.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;They initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, and communicated or collaborated with more natural philosophically inclined members.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 198](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198).

The Renaissance view of art as a form of knowledge underscores the close relationship between artistic practice and the philosophical study of nature, bridging the gap between empirical experimentation and theoretical exploration.

An early example is found\nin the preface to the chapter on painting by Theophilus Presbyter in De diversis\nartibus where he writes:\nWe read in the exordium of mundane creation that man, made after the image and likeness\nof God and animated by the inspiration of the Divine breath, was also, by the excellence of\nso much dignity, raised above other living creatures; as capable of reason, he merited to\nparticipate in the counsel and genius of Divine providence, and, gifted with free-will, he]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=118\nPages: 118\nface shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for\ndust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\nIn the text of Theophilus Presbyter this connection between the human ability of\nartisanal creativity through his divine derivation (the man as imago and similitudo\nof God according to his faculty) is emphasized. But the negative connotations of all\nhuman artistic creation as the result of the Fall is turned positively into a iure\nhereditario, into the ability to create art and ingenium. For the contemporary\nbeholder the connection of Kunstkammer and Fall of Mankind and the correlation\nof the ability of man to create and cultivate and the loss of the paradisiacal, per\ndefinition non-cultivated condition, must have been obvious.41\nBehind the biblical scene the viewer discovers miners at work, a diviner, who is\nin search of ore deposits, and two workers with wedges extracting minerals from the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120\nPages: 120,119\nto the subject of God as craftsman who, like his earthly colleague, is dependent on\ngood materials and hot fires to make excellent stones and minerals.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of <strong>art as a reflection of divine creation</strong> is central to Renaissance thought, as it connects human artistic creativity with the divine act of creation. Here are key insights:

1. <strong>Man as a Second God</strong>:  
   Renaissance thinkers like Federico Zuccari described human artists as &quot;almost a second God,&quot; attributing to them the power to imitate and emulate divine creation through their art. This divine-like ability allowed artists to create new worlds, reflecting both their understanding of nature and their capacity to enhance it through their creations. Art was seen as a means to replicate the natural world and create &quot;new Paradises&quot; on earth, embodying both divine and natural principles.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;He would be almost a second God, he [God] also wants to give him [man] the faculty to form within himself a mental inner design, so that he [man] by means of this could recognize all the creatures &amp; to create inside him new worlds...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

2. <strong>Art as an Expression of Divine Wisdom</strong>:  
   Art was considered an extension of divine wisdom, where the artist, through careful study of nature, could reflect the intricate design of God’s creation. The act of creating art mirrored the creative processes of God, transforming base materials into refined and meaningful objects. This process was seen as analogous to alchemical transformations, where both art and alchemy sought to reveal the hidden potential within natural materials.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;According to Zuccari’s art theoretical writings, it is the similarity to God that enables both the scientist and the artist to achieve an inner understanding of nature—the scientist through research to unveil nature’s secrets and the artist in artworks that imitate nature’s processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

3. <strong>Creation in the Image of God</strong>:  
   Artistic creation was seen as a continuation of the divine act, with artists embodying the role of God’s agents on earth. Their ability to shape and transform materials was viewed as a reflection of their divine origin, linking human creativity to the broader cosmological order. This idea was frequently invoked in discussions of the arts and sciences during the Renaissance, where human ingenuity was considered a direct gift from God.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;A learned reference to contemporary Italian art theory could have followed, that is, to the creation of Man in the image of God and Man’s power to know, imitate and control nature.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120).

These insights reveal how deeply intertwined art, natural philosophy, and theology were in the Renaissance, with artists viewed as intermediaries between the divine and the natural world.

If this biological\nanalogy taken from the animal and herbal kingdoms is applied to the mineral, it\ncan be extended to metallogenesis: if in the field of animals and plants male and\nfemale beings can be found who procreate by the union of the active and formative\nmale seeds or semen and the female passive receiving matter\u2014and if this means\nthat this species can recreate self-reliantly\u2014 then it is not too far fetched to suspect\ncomparable ways of reproduction and growth in the reign of minerals and assume\nthe existence of metal \u2018semen\u2019.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=125\nPages: 125\nChronicken.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of <strong>imitation of nature&#x27;s processes</strong> in the Renaissance was central to the work of both artists and alchemists. Here are key points from the document regarding this theme:

1. <strong>Art and Nature</strong>:
   Renaissance artists, like alchemists, were seen as imitators of nature’s processes. The creation of artwork was viewed as analogous to natural creation, where materials such as metals and stones were transformed into refined and perfected objects. This idea was deeply embedded in both artisanal and philosophical practices, where artists were thought to mirror God’s creation by transforming raw materials into objects of beauty.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Naturally formed minerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only the mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also to imitate the natural processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 120](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=120)

2. <strong>Art as a Second Nature</strong>:
   Leonardo da Vinci referred to human creations as &quot;second nature,&quot; suggesting that through art and craftsmanship, humans could emulate and improve upon nature. This concept reflects the Renaissance belief that humans, endowed with intellect and creativity, could replicate natural processes, whether in art, science, or alchemy.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Gravity and force together with material movement and percussion are the four accidental powers by which the human race in its marvellous and varied works seems to reveal itself and a second nature in this world.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, pages 82-83](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=82)

3. <strong>Alchemical Processes and Art</strong>:
   Alchemical practices were deeply connected to artistic processes, particularly in fields like metallurgy and glassmaking. Both alchemists and artists sought to transform base materials into something greater, whether it was turning base metals into gold or creating art from raw substances. This transformation was seen as a reflection of nature’s ability to shape and refine materials over time.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Man is nature’s chief instrument, because nature is concerned only with the production of elementary things, but from these elementary things man produces an infinite number of compounds...&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 82](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=82)

This connection between art, alchemy, and the imitation of nature highlights the Renaissance belief in the transformative power of human creativity, paralleling natural processes in artistic and scientific endeavors.

Most recently there has been particular\ninterest in exploring alchemy\u2019s place among artists and artisans, an investigation\nthat rightly reflects the crucial position of material production within chymistry\nthroughout its history. Important questions remain however in regard to demonstrating the specific theoretical and practical content of such artisanal endeavors,\nand in terms of identifying connections between them and the better documented\nand recognized work carried out in more visible and more intellectually elevated\ncircles.5 How did artists and artisans understand chymistry, and to what extent did\nthey practice it? To what extent were they familiar with more bookish or scholarly\nideas, practices, practitioners (and vice versa)? Can exchanges of knowledge\nbetween the two groups be clearly documented? Can we identify what practices,\nmaterials, or ideas passed between them, and how one group might have responded\nto information from the other? Answering such questions promises to further\nilluminate chymistry\u2019s cultural and intellectual place in early modern Europe.\nSome such connections seem relatively clear. Chymical workshops appear\nfrequently in Netherlandish genre painting, indicating that Northern artists were\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the\nallegorical images of widely varying artistic quality in chymical books and manuscripts imply some sort of contact between author/practitioner and artist. Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth. Yet none of these contacts tells us anything about possible\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally. On the other\nhand, the basic materials of their artisanal labors\u2014gold and silver\u2014held a central\n5\nSee Smith, Body of the Artisan.\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations; and Brinkman, Alchemist in de prentkunst.

Principe\nposition in chymistry, that is to say, in the transmutational endeavors that figured so\nprominently in early modern chymistry and that promised such highly profitable\nreturns. Thus, the artisanal experience of gold- and silversmithing provided a\ncertain commonality with the pursuit of metallic chymistry, and might easily\nhave inclined such artisans toward transmutational endeavors, and hence toward\ncontact with other aspiring transmuters who were not themselves artisans. The\npractical experience of gold- and silversmiths also rendered them sources of\ninformation for those wishing to know more about the properties and potentialities\nof the precious metals. Accordingly, gold- and silversmiths figure prominently in\nmany examples of the genre of \u201ctransmutation histories\u201d\u2014detailed published\naccounts of successful transmutations\u2014where such artisans are routinely called\nin to assay a sample of the gold or silver produced, and thus act as expert witnesses\nto its authenticity.7\nFortunately for such a study, there existed a mid seventeenth-century network of\nalchemical practitioners where such interactions can be well documented. From the\n1640s through the 1660s, a network of correspondents and collaborators that included\nseveral gold- and silversmiths linked three major urban centers\u2014Amsterdam, Paris,\nand London\u2014and freely crossed political, linguistic, social, and confessional boundaries. Its numerous participants shared ideas, experiences, and aspirations relating to\na variety of chymically-based projects, and, crucially for such a project as this one,\nthis network left behind a wealth of written records that provide historians with the\nnecessary clear evidence from which to work. I will therefore focus here on the\nchymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group and their interactions\nwith its other members and with the broader realms of chymistry.\nAnthoni and Andries Grill in the Netherlands and Sweden\nOne part of this network has already been extensively studied, namely the portion\ngathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662) in London.8 The\nHartlib Circle\u2019s utopian, educational, and commercial schemes made chymistry a\nsubject of particular interest due to its lucrative potential. An important contact in\nthis regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591\u20131668) in\nAmsterdam. Moriaen both pursued his own chymical interests and aspirations and\nfunctioned as a communications hub for others who shared those interests. Working\nfrom Moriaen\u2019s surviving correspondence with Hartlib and his prote\u0301ge\u0301 Benjamin\nWorsley (1618\u20131673), John Young has beautifully documented several chymical\n7\nOn transmutation histories, see Principe, Secrets of Alchemy, 167\u201370, Aspiring Adept, 93\u20138, 108\u2013\n11; and Newman, Gehennical Fire, 3\u201313.\n8\nClassic treatments of the Hartlib Circle include Turnbull, Hartlib; and Webster, Great\nInstauration.\n\nPages 182:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n161\nprojects in which Moriaen was involved. One of these projects, undertaken in 1651,\ninvolved trying to produce silver from tin. Four hopeful experimenters collaborated\non this project: Moriaen, Worsley, the German inventor and chymist Johannes\nKu\u0308ffler (1595\u20131677), and one whom Young calls a \u201cvery shadowy figure\u201d named\nAnthoni Grill and who is most often designated simply as Aurifaber, that is, the\ngoldsmith.9\nGrill is, in fact, not so shadowy a figure. He has left behind substantial historical\ntraces, artifacts, and documentation. Furthermore, while his involvement with\ntransmutational chymistry has hitherto been taken as a failure, fresh research now\nnot only documents his laudible chymical ingenuity and engagement with contemporaneous scholarship, but also reveals that he eventually turned his chymical\nexpertise into an enormous success. Grill thus provides an outstanding and detailed\nexample of the alchemical activity of an artisan.\nAnthoni Grill was born about 1607 in Augsburg. He and two brothers, all silverand goldsmiths like their father Balthasar Grill before them, left Germany to\npractice their trade in the Netherlands.10 Several pieces of fine silverwork by\nAnthoni\u2019s younger brother Johannes (c.1614\u20131670) survive, as do a few pieces\nprobably by Anthoni himself (Figs. 1 and 2).11 Their elder brother Andries (1604\u2013\n1665), who set up shop in The Hague, is considered by some to have been one of the\nfinest gold- and silversmiths in the mid-century Netherlands and several pieces of\nhis work also survive (Fig. 3).12 Anthoni arrived in Amsterdam around 1630,\nmarried in 1634, and became established as a silversmith on the Koningsstraat.\nYet his interests and ambitions soon led him beyond the artisanal working of\nprecious metals. Notarial records indicate that already in 1635 he undertook a\nproject to reclaim silver, copper, and lead from used testen (cupels), indicating an\ninterest, and presumably some degree of technical ability, in chymical processes.\nBy 1649 he was known as an assayer as well as a silver- and goldsmith. The notarial\nrecords also report that in 1651, he paid the handsome sum of 12,000 guilders (over\n\u00a31,000) for a house with a large yard on the Looiersgracht in order to set up a\nsmelterij (smelter) for obtaining gold and silver.13\nThis Dutch archival record is corroborated and elaborated in letters from\nMoriaen in Amsterdam to Worsley in London. These letters also recount the extent\nof Grill\u2019s devotion, growing knowledge, and labor in chymical processes. Moriaen\n9\nYoung, Johann Moriaen, 226\u20139, 231. Young translates Aurifaber as goldmaker (which would\nhave been aurifactor) rather than as goldsmith.

This knowledge indeed spawned such boldness that he did not hesitate\nto spend 25,000 guilders or more in buying the estate and in erecting things necessary for\nthe work, and he is sparing no labor in completing them as quickly as possible, and is\nleaving no stone unturned.14\n14\n\u201cAurifaber, non procul ab aedibus meis 12 florenorum millibus fundum sibi coe\u0308mit, in quo\npraeter domicilium sex laboratoria diversa exstruit, jam de opere certus non tam nostro, quam suo\nipsius, isto inquam opere quod ex lectione, partim Paracelsi partim Glauberi, propria\u0302 meditatione\nconsequutus est [. . .] novit praeterea ex quolibet Talco argentum vel aurum elicere prout Talcum\ndispositum et ditatum a Natura est.

Principe\nTwo months later, Moriaen remarked to Worsley:\nYou would really be astonished if you saw the supplies, instruments, and beautiful order of\nthe laboratories! He [Grill] and his wife now spend the nights in the new lodgings so that\nthey can be with the workers morning and evening; the building is progressing quickly, but\nso much construction nevertheless requires a reasonable amount of time.15\nGrill also displayed his knowledge and experience by critiquing several\nchymical processes that the chymical entrepreneur Johann Rudolf Glauber\n(c.1604\u20131670) had boasted about and endeavored to sell.16 In particular, Grill\ndetermined that Glauber\u2019s process for separating gold and silver \u201cdoes not excel\nthat which is customary to him [Grill] in regard to either the labor or the cost.\u201d\nGrill\u2019s own method, which he probably developed in the course of his assaying\nwork, used special vessels (made of gold!) to limit breakage and loss and cleverly\nrecovered and recycled the acid necessary for the process, thus cutting costs by\ntwo-thirds. Hence, as Moriaen asserts, \u201cthe Goldsmith\u2019s method exceeds others in\nits utility and facility.\u201d17\nGrill was clearly much more than a mere operator. In terms of the collaborative\ntin project, he developed one of the main experimental protocols to be used,\nreferred to by Worsley as the \u201cGrillian\u201d method.18 Though it is not possible to\nreconstruct from the sources at hand the theoretical basis upon which he developed\nhis method, this process was characterized by an attention to operational facility\nand feasibility in comparison with the more laborious method proposed by their\ncollaborator Ku\u0308ffler. The third collaborator, Worsley, also offered operational\nsuggestions about the process, which are not recorded, but from other contemporaneous sources, Worsley seems to have had more enthusiasm about the potential of\nchymistry than experience in its practice.19 Moriaen reported that Grill\u2019s workers\n15\n\u201c[. . .] mirareris profecto si Laboratoriorum copiam, apparatum et ordinem decentem videres.\nIam ipse cum Uxore in novo hospitio pernoctant, ut laborantibus matutine\u0300 et sero adesse possint,\naedificium etiam celeriter progreditur sed tot ac tanta, moram tamen requirunt justam.\u201d (Moriaen\nto Worsley, 26 May 1651, HP 9/16/6A).\n16\nOn Glauber, see Young, Johann Moriaen, 183\u201398, passim; and Smith, \u201cVital Spirits.\u201d\n17\n\u201cIlla de qua Glauberus gloriari solebat, aurifabro judice, non antecellit hanc sibi usitatam, vel\nquo\u0300 ad laborem vel quo\u0300 ad lucrum [. . .]. Aurifabri artificium aliis et utilitate et facilitate sua\u0302\npraestat.\u201d (Moriaen to Worsley, 31 March 1651, HP 9/16/3A). Grill\u2019s method isolated the residual\nsilver nitrate from the parting, and, rather than recovering the silver by the more usual method of\nprecipitation with copper, instead destructively distilled the nitrate, leaving the silver as a residue\nand allowing much of the nitric acid used initially to be recovered as a distillate. Grill also took the\nunusual step of using vessels made of gold [\u201cvasis suis aureis\u201d], rather than of glass, for distilling\nthe acid. Despite the cost of the precious metal, its durability (and inertness) relative to constantly\nbreaking or exploding glass vessels, actually saved money, considering that there would be no loss\nof the precious metal. Hartlib might be referring either to Grill or to a member of his family still in\nAugsburg when he recorded that Moriaen had informed him that \u201cthe Goldsmith at Augsb[urg]\nmade his melting or refining Pots instead of glass or earth of pure gold wherby hee hath gained or\nsaved many thou[sand]s,\u201d see HP 28/2/17B.\n18\nMoriaen to Worsley, 26 May 1651, HP 9/16/6A\u20136B.\n19\nNewman &amp; Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, 236\u201356.\n\nPages 186:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n165\ncould consistently prepare two and one-half pounds (five Marks) of silver from\n100 pounds of tin, a quantity augmentable by repeating the process on the\nuntransmuted tin recovered. It is possible that they were separating silver present\nas an impurity in the tin and/or the lead used in the process, although Moriaen\u2019s\nclaim to have eventually turned 27 % of the weight of the tin into silver is\nimplausible. In the end, the project for obtaining silver from tin seems not to\nhave fulfilled initial expectations given Moriaen\u2019s and Grill\u2019s subsequent financial\ndifficulties, even though (or perhaps because) Grill, according to one report, spent\n\u00a31,200 on it.20\nNevertheless, some initial success may stand behind the contract that Grill\nsigned in July 1653 with his brother Andries to supply him with silver, presumably\nfor use and sale in his silversmithing business.21 Significantly, Andries himself\nworked on transmutational alchemy as well. The Danish traveller, savant, and\nchymical author Olaus Borrichius (1626\u20131690) was told during his trip through\nthe Netherlands in 1662 that \u201cthe goldsmith Grill of The Hague, a German, drew a\ngreat deal of lead, some silver, and some gold, from Norwegian lead ore.\u201d The ore\ncame from Skien, and Andries worked on it in hundred pound quantities, implying\nthat his operational resources were substantial.22 Rather more interesting is a\nsecond report Borrichius obtained in Paris three years later in 1665:\nGrill of The Hague [. . .] dissolved or cooked a piece of lead in spirit of salt for several\nmonths, saw something star-like in the midst of the spirit [. . .] and after the liquid had\nevaporated, by assaying the remaining material in a cupel, he found a sixth part of it to be\ngood silver, but afterwards was unable to find a similar spirit of salt.23\nAt least as surprising as the transmutation itself is the fact that Andries Grill did\nthis experiment \u201cupon the advice of Bohn of Leipzig,\u201d surely the famous chymist,\nauthor, and professor of medicine at the University of Leipzig, Johannes Bohn\n(1640\u20131718). Under what circumstances would a silversmith in The Hague be in\ncontact with a professor of Leipzig? Since the experiment lasted several months, it\nmust have been begun in 1664, well before Bohn had published anything on\nchemistry, and even before he formally received his doctorate. In 1663\u20131664,\nhowever, Bohn was travelling through Northern Europe, including the Netherlands,\nand thus must have met and spoken with Grill at that time, and suggested this\ntransmutational experiment to him. This solution begs the question of why Bohn\n20\nHP 9/16/3B; \u201chee [Grill] adventur\u2019s 12. hundred lb upon an Exp[eriment] of Tinne and\nsomething else in which Mr. Mor[iaen] hath also an Adventure and is a very promising busines.\u201d\n(Hartlib, Ephemerides 1651, HP 28/2/15A). This figure might simply refer to the purchase of the\nestate, rather than to the direct costs for the tin project.\n21\nEeghens, \u201cGrill\u2019s Hofje,\u201d 50. Much more about Anthoni\u2019s activities and aspirations could\ncertainly be gained from a closer inspection of the many acts recorded by his notary Justus van\nde Ven, such as this contract with Andries, which I have not been able to examine directly.\n22\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol. II, 58\u20139, 1 February 1662.\n23\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol. IV, 276, 4 March 1665.\n\nPages 187:\n166\nL.M. Principe\nwould have visited Grill in the first place, unless Grill had achieved some notoriety\nfor chymical interests or knowledge, that is, in topics of interest to Bohn as well.\nWhatever notoriety Andries Grill had obtained prior to Bohn\u2019s visit was substantially augmented shortly thereafter when one of the most celebrated reports of\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone recounted the same experiment with lead that Borrichius\nhad recorded privately. In late 1666, Johann Friedrich Helvetius (1625\u20131709),\nphysician to the Prince of Orange (1650\u20131702), reportedly received a visit at his\nhouse in The Hague from a mysterious stranger. This visitor showed Helvetius\nsome heavy lumps of material that he claimed to be the Philosophers\u2019 Stone that he\nhad prepared, and eventually gave Helvetius a tiny sample. After the visitor\ndeparted, Helvetius melted some lead, cast in the crumb of material according to\nthe instructions he had been given, and thereby produced pure gold that was\nafterwards successfully examined by a goldsmith and then formally assayed by a\nlocal silversmith named Brechtel, an artisan undoubtedly identifiable as Hans\nCoenraet Brechtel (1609\u20131675), a native of Nuremberg, resident in The Hague\nfrom 1640, and the most prominent silversmith in the city at this time.24 Helvetius\npublished this account as Vitulus aureus in 1667, and the story gained wide renown\nacross Europe, provoking the interest of many, including Benedict Spinoza (1632\u2013\n1677) and Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691).\nAs a preamble to his own account, Helvetius reported other transmutational\nexperiences, one of which \u201cwas done at The Hague by a certain silversmith whose\nname is Grill.\u201d25 Helvetius recounts that this \u201csilversmith and student of alchemy\nmuch-engaged in the art\u201d obtained some spirit of salt \u201cnot prepared by the common\nmethod\u201d from Helvetius\u2019s friend Johann Caspar Kno\u0308ttner, a cloth dyer (and apparently, another type of artisan employed in chymical work). Consistent with\nBorrichius\u2019s private diary\u2019s account of the event, Helvetius tells how Grill poured\nthis spirit of salt over some lead in a glazed vessel (\u201csuch as is used for preserves\nand confections\u201d) and after two weeks was delighted to see a silvery \u201cstar\u201d floating\nin the liquid\u2014perhaps some sort of crystalline concretion. Grill told Helvetius of\nthis phenomenon, which the silversmith believed to be the \u201csignate star of the\nphilosophers that he had read about in Basilius [Valentinus].\u201d Helvetius and \u201cmany\nother honest men\u201d went to see the experiment and marveled at it. After the\nsummer\u2019s heat had evaporated the liquid, Helvetius continues, Grill took some of\nthe now spongy and ashen-colored lead, with a piece of the star-like formation, and\ncupelled it. From one pound he obtained 12 ounces of silver, and out of this silver he\nisolated two ounces of gold. Helvetius notes that he still owns some of Grill\u2019s\nspongy lead, a piece of the star, and samples of the transmuted silver and gold, all of\nwhich he can display to interested or as yet unconvinced inquirers.\nUnfortunately, this wonderful success did not make Andries rich. For he tried to\nlearn Kno\u0308ttner\u2019s method for preparing the spirit of salt, but the cloth-dyer had in the\n24\nFor Brechtel (or Breghtel) and his work, see Pijzel-Dommisse, Haags goud en zilver, 30:\n\u201czonder twijfel de belangrijkste en meest veelzijdige Haagse zilversmid uit de zeventiende eeuw.\u201d\n25\nHelvetius, Vitulus aureus, 831\u20132.\n\nPages 188:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n167\nmeantime forgotten exactly which sort of spirit of salt he had given Grill, and while\ntrying to determine which it was, \u201che and his entire family were seized by the\nplague, and died.\u201d As for the silversmith, shortly thereafter \u201che fell into the water\nand exchanged life for death; no investigator after the death of these two has been\nable to discover the art of making it.\u201d26\nReturning again to the younger brother Anthoni in Amsterdam, we find that his\nchymical work and interests continued unabated despite the collapse of the collaborative venture on tin. A 1657 letter to Moriaen indicates that by that time Grill had\ntravelled to the coppermines of Sweden and done assaying there. His account of\nSwedish ores and answers to chymical questions posed to him (probably from\nWorsley) display significant knowledge of metallic smelting, refining, and\nassaying. The same letter also reports that he had just purchased the astounding\nquantity of fourteen thousand pounds of English or Scottish potloet, that is, the lead\ncompound\u2014mostly litharge (lead oxides)\u2014used for glazing earthenware.27 Grill\ncomplained however, that he was cheated in some unspecified way, such that the\nmaterial proved unsatisfactory for his intended purpose. He nevertheless remarked\nthat although \u201cI find good uses for it in the little, I want to try it also in the great, and\nif it turns out well I will let you know.\u201d The meaning here of im kleinen and im\ngro\u00dfen remain slightly ambiguous, but it is possible that these terms refer to the\n\u201cLesser Work\u201d and \u201cGreater Work,\u201d namely, two methods of effecting metallic\ntransmutation, the latter synonymous with making the Philosophers\u2019 Stone.28\nAnthoni Grill\u2019s Swedish Success\nIn 1659, Grill left Amsterdam in poor financial shape. But his story does not end\nthere. He and his family emigrated from the Netherlands and settled in Sweden. The\nfull details of his activities there remain to be uncovered at present; however, it is\nclear that in Sweden, a land rich in metallic ores (which is presumably what drew\nhim there) Grill\u2019s fortunes improved dramatically. Borrichius, once again, provides\na report. In 1663, the Danish savant, then in Paris, learned that Grill:\nstirred up partly by the works of Glauber, and partly by his own industry [propria\u0302\nindustria\u0302], melts out gold and silver with profit from [a mixture of] litharge, iron and\ncopper scoriae, sand (especially the slate from Angers) [. . .] and a particular red earth, such\n26\nHelvetius, Vitulus aureus, 832. Indeed, Andries is known to have died in 1665, consistent with\nHelvetius\u2019s account.\n27\nGrill to Moriaen, 13 June 1657, transcribed in Moriaen to Hartlib, 22 Jun 1657; HP 42/2/10A\u2013\n11B.

What is clear however is that\nGrill\u2019s social and financial situation must have become quite solid by this time in\norder for him to run a workshop that employed 16 assistants and that could process\n900 pounds of litharge in a day. After Borrichius summarizes Grill\u2019s procedure, he\nrecords the opinion of \u201can extremely knowledgeable Frenchman\u201d that this process\nwas not the mere extraction of preexisting precious metals, but a true transmutation\nof the lead. Applying Helmontian (or perhaps Suchtenian) theory, the unnamed\nFrench chymist explained Grill\u2019s results as \u201can exaltation of the lead through the\nfermentative odor of the admixed scoriae.\u201d30 He added that if Grill had recognized\n29\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol.

Interestingly, this idea of using the \u201cfermentative odor\u201d of copper scoria to effect transmutation was a\n30\n\nPages 190:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n169\nthis operation as fermentative, and left the mixture in a hotter fire longer, he could\nhave increased his daily profit to 300 crowns, and suggested that Grill should build a\nbigger furnace outside of some city to effect it. The Frenchman also compared his\nown experiments with litharge and their results to those carried out by Grill.31 That\nBorrichius and a learned French chymist heard about and discussed this matter\nseriously in Paris indicates that Grill and his chymical work in Sweden had attained\na substantial level of international notoriety.\nBy 1664, Grill had risen to become Riksguardien vid Kronans Myntverk (Master\nof the Royal Mint) in Stockholm. How exactly he attained this prominent state\nposition less than five years after fleeing his creditors in Amsterdam remains to be\ntold, but certainly it required the expertise he had accumulated over the years in\nassaying, metalworking, and chymical processes involving metals and minerals.\nInterestingly, when he received the position as mintmaster, he also obtained rights\nto make and sell gold- and silverware and a license to engage in foreign trade,\nshowing that he had by no means turned his back on his traditional artisanal craft of\nsilversmithing.32 It is also reported that Grill was involved in lead and silver\nproduction at the mines in Stora Skedvi in the province of Dalarna, and tried to\nextract silver and gold from copper ore.\nIn 1664, Borrichius was part of a conversation at Henri Justel\u2019s (1620\u20131693)\nhouse in Paris where he heard from Abraham Cronstro\u0308m (1640\u20131696) that \u201cGrill\ntried new arts in Sweden in vain.\u201d33 Cronstro\u0308m was son of the mintmaster and\nprefect of the Avesta copper mines in Sweden, and would himself become a\nmintmaster in Stockholm in 1674. Regardless of Cro\u0308nstrom\u2019s less-than-positive\nassertion about Grill\u2019s unspecified \u201cnew arts,\u201d it is clear that Grill had achieved\nconsiderable success and renown in Sweden, such that he came to the notice (and\nperhaps the envy) of the large and powerful Cronstro\u0308m family. Indeed, Grill\namassed a fortune large enough to purchase a prominent residence on the oldest\nand most fashionable square in Stockholm, not far from the Royal Mint and the\nRoyal Palace. This house remained in the Grill family for more than two centuries;\nit still stands at No. 3 Stortorget, and continues to be known today as the Grillska\nHuset (Grill House, Fig. 4). Upon Grill\u2019s death in late 1675, Anthoni passed his\nfinancial and social success on to his descendants. His son Anthoni (1640\u20131702),\nwho had come with the family from Amsterdam, followed his father\u2019s profession,\nestablishing himself as a goldsmith, jeweller, and merchant in Stockholm, and took\nup his father\u2019s post as mintmaster, as well as becoming engaged in ironworks at\nSo\u0308derfors.34 His eldest son, also named Anthoni Grill (1664\u20131727), returned to\npathway investigated by George Starkey\u2014who was also a member of the correspondence network\nexplored in this paper\u2014during the 1650s, Newman &amp; Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, 128\u201335,\nesp. 130\u20131.\n31\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol.

Principe\nAmsterdam in 1686 where he amassed a considerable fortune, bought a substantial\nhouse on the Keisersgracht, became official assayer to the exchange bank in 1712\n(presumably having been trained in the practice by his father and/or grandfather),\nand in 1721 established the hofje\u2014an almshouse for the elderly\u2014still known today\nas Grill\u2019s Hofje.35 Two other sons of Anthoni\u2014Abraham and Carlos\u2014remained in\nStockholm where they established and ran one of largest and most successful\nmerchant houses of eighteenth-century Sweden.36\nAfter Grill\u2019s remove to Sweden, the house and magnificent laboratories he had\nleft behind on the Looiersgracht were rented out in 1660 to none other than Glauber,\nwho lived and worked there until the complex was ordered to be sold in 1661 to pay\noff Grill\u2019s Dutch creditors.37 It was very probably in these lodgings that the\nphysician, traveller, and scholar Samuel Sorbie\u0300re (1615\u20131670) visited Glauber in\n1660 and marveled at his multiple (\u201cno fewer than four, at the back of a large\nhouse\u201d) laboratories: \u201cHis laboratories are magnificent, and occupy a wing of his\nlodgings and the rear of his garden. They are of a prodigious size, and of a\ncompletely unique structure.\u201d38 Most or all of what so impressed Sorbie\u0300re was in\nfact probably designed and erected by Grill, the construction of which led ultimately to his bankruptcy and emigration to Sweden.\nAnthoni Grill thus emerges as an artisan who developed a substantial\nknowledge\u2014practical and theoretical\u2014of chymistry, both transmutational and\nmore broadly metallic, and thereby elevated himself to a high social and financial\nsituation. Not only was Anthoni capable of designing, carrying out, and improving\npractical productive processes, but he also operated at a higher epistemic level,\nreading the books of at least Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) and Glauber and designing\ntherefrom new experiments and processes propria\u0302 meditatione and propria\u0302\nindustria\u0302. From his initial profession of silver- and goldsmithing and the associated\ncraft of assaying, Grill kept expanding his horizons and expertise to engage in\nsophisticated and sometimes collaborative chymical projects that reached all the\nway to that summum bonum, the preparation of the Philosophers\u2019 Stone, and he\ndesigned and built substantial and costly laboratories for his processes and explorations. The knowledge embodied in these workspaces and their instruments were\nundoubtedly transmitted to his coworkers and laborants, and certainly to Glauber\nwho chose to rent Grill\u2019s laboratories almost as soon as they became available.\nInformation and new findings from Grill in Amsterdam were shared with his\ncollaborators, and transmitted by Moriaen into England where they were disseminated through the Hartlib Circle, which at this time included far better-known and\nwidely-published chymists like George Starkey (1628\u20131665) and Boyle. Likewise,\nnews and details of Grill\u2019s Swedish work were discussed as far away as Paris, where\n35\nEeghens, \u201cGrill\u2019s Hofje,\u201d 51\u20136; and Kroes, \u201cNederlands-Zweedse familie Grill,\u201d 75\u2013101.\nMu\u0308ller, Merchant Houses of Stockholm.\n37\nEeghens, \u201cGrill\u2019s Hofje,\u201d 50.\n38\nSorbie\u0300re, Diverses matieres curieuses, 176 and 180, in a letter dated 13 July 1660 to Guillaume\nde Bautru.\n36\n\nPages 192:\nGoldsmiths and Chymists: The Activity of Artisans Within Alchemical Circles\n171\none learned chymist found it sufficiently interesting to apply the latest chymical\ntheories to it. The accounts tendered by Borrichius and Helvetius indicate that\nAndries Grill too was tied into a network of chymists in and outside of The Hague,\njust as his brother Anthoni was with respect to Amsterdam. Helvetius and others\ngathered at Andries\u2019 workshop to see a remarkable experiment about which he had\ninformed them, and Helvetius used the silversmith\u2019s results in his own publication.\nAdditionally, just as Anthoni had been reading and interpreting at least Glauber and\nParacelsus, so too his brother Andries read Basilius Valentinus, and connected what\nhe had read to the results of his practical work. Thus it is clear that the two\nsilversmiths were not operating in isolation from other practitioners, nor separated\nfrom the textual and other intellectual traditions of chymistry, but clearly\nexchanged information with these other groups.\nAnthoni Grill was almost certainly unusual among silver- and goldsmiths in\nterms of his chymical sophistication and investigations, not to mention the eventual\nsuccess he acquired thereby for himself and for his family. One should not,\ntherefore, extend his example too readily to metalworking artisans as a whole; we\nwill need more case-studies to assess accurately the place of such artisans in the\nchymical world of early modern Europe. Nevertheless, Anthoni and Andries Grill\ndo provide clear and well-documented examples of the chymical activities and the\nintellectual contacts and contexts that some seventeenth-century artisans could\nhave. Now I will turn to examples provided by goldsmiths elsewhere in Europe.\nParisian Goldsmiths and Chymists\nMoriaen and the chymical group around him in the Netherlands that included\nAnthoni Grill maintained connections to circles wider than the one in England.\nThe recent discovery of a large cache of formerly unidentified manuscripts belonging to the diplomat, adventurer, and natural philosopher Sir Kenelm Digby (1603\u2013\n1665) reveals that Moriaen was also in direct contact with one of the most important\nchymists in France at the very same time he was in contact with Worsley, Hartlib,\nand Starkey in England.39 One volume of these Digby manuscripts consists of\nlengthy excerpts copied from notebooks kept by Samuel Cottereau Duclos (1598\u2013\n1685).40 Duclos was the first chymist chosen for the Acade\u0301mie Royale des Sciences\nupon its formation in 1666, and he became a leading figure in that body. He\npublished on chymical composition and the analysis of mineral waters, wrote a\nsubstantial treatise on salts, sought the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and the alkahest,\nand presented a lengthy critique of Boyle\u2019s ideas on chymistry particularly his\n39\n40\nPrincipe, \u201cSir Kenelm Digby.\u201d\nBibliothe\u0300que Nationale et Universitaire de Strasbourg (hereinafter BNU) MS 370.\n\nPages 193:\n172\nL.M. Principe\napplication of the mechanical philosophy to chymical processes.41 The Digby\nmanuscript preserves partial transcripts of letters from Moriaen and Glauber to\nDuclos dating to 1651\u20131652. Moriaen sent Duclos information about Glauber\u2019s\nprocesses\u2014he sent some of the very same material simultaneously to Starkey in\nLondon\u2014and acted as a conduit for queries from Duclos to Glauber, and Glauber\u2019s\nresponses back to Duclos, thus brokering an exchange between the technological\nentrepreneur Glauber and one of France\u2019s most eminent chymists.42\nThe fact that Digby was able to make copies out of Duclos\u2019 notebook attests to a\nclose relationship between the two, a relationship corroborated by their collaborative work outlined in other manuscripts of the Digby cache. But these same\nmanuscripts also reveal a wider circle of closely-knit chymists active in Paris\nthroughout the 1650s and 1660s. This circle included, besides Duclos and Digby,\nthe abbe\u0301 Jullien de Loberie (chaplain of the Colle\u0300ge Fortet) and an abbe\u0301 Boucaud,\nThomas Gobelin (member of a prominent family and counselor to the Paris\nParlement), the chymical authors Jean-Baptiste de la Noue, Pierre Borel, and\nFranc\u0327ois de Soucy, Sieur de Gerzan, as well as a host of others. The group shared\nmanuscripts, processes, and other information gathered from books or private\ncorrespondence, and collaborated (in various combinations) on practical chymical\nprocesses, most frequently of a transmutational nature. Some of them frequented\nwell-known intellectual groupings such as the academy of the abbe\u0301 Bourdelot.43\nThe travelling savants Borrichius and Henry Oldenburg (1619\u20131677) also\ninteracted with the group during their visits to Paris.\nSeveral documents record the participation of goldsmiths in this Parisian\nchymical circle. One notable example is an experiment recorded initially by Duclos\nin the early 1650s under the heading aurum redivivum and transcribed and annotated later by Digby. The process involves sealing gold hermetically in a flask and\nexposing it to sunlight and moonlight at particular seasons and then burying it in\nthe ground for extended periods, reportedly causing the gold to undergo various\nchanges to its properties.44 The annotations in Digby\u2019s handwriting clearly indicate\nthat Duclos thought highly enough of the report that he attempted to repeat the\nexperiment himself. What is probably the same process was described some years\nlater by the abbe\u0301 Boucaud, a close chymical associate of Duclos, who attributed the\nwork to quidam aurifaber (a certain goldsmith).45 Digby annotated his transcription\nof the process with a cross-reference reading \u201cSee among my loose papers, the same\nprocesse communicated to me by Monsieur Caillard, who wrought it with the\n41\nOn Duclos, see Sturdy, Science and Social Status, 107\u20139; Tode\u0301riciu, \u201cBiographie de Samuel\nDuclos,\u201d 64\u20137; Stroup, Company of Scientists, and \u201cAffaire Duclos.\u201d\n42\nPrincipe, \u201cSir Kenelm Digby,\u201d 16\u20138.\n43\nOn the Bourdelot Academy, see Brown, Scientific Organizations, 231\u201353.\n44\nBNU MS 370, fol. 39v\u201341v.\n45\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol.

The Caillart known to\nDigby and Boucaud may have been the most well-known of these, Jacques Caillart\nthe Elder, who practiced his trade in Paris from about 1620 until the 1660s.\nAlternatively, the alchemical Caillart may have been his son, Jacques Caillart the\nYounger, born about 1622 and active until at least the 1670s.48\nThese accounts are of particular interest for several reasons. First of all, the\nprocess for preparing this aurum redivivum seems to have been conceived and\ncarried out initially by two Parisian goldsmiths who reported their results to the\nwider Parisian circle. Repetitions and related experiments with the exposure of gold\nto sunlight and/or moonlight and subterranean conditions continued within the\ngroup\u2014now at the hands of others, often more prominent natural philosophers,\nfor at least a decade after the initial report. Indeed, reports of the first results\nattracted the attention of several better-known members of the Parisian circle\u2014\nDuclos, Digby, and Boucaud at least\u2014who proposed modifications to it based on\ntheir own practical and theoretical knowledge; these suggestions may well have\nbeen transmitted back to the goldsmiths. For example, the initial insistence that\nparticular astrological conditions were necessary seems to have been debunked and\ndiscarded. Duclos, for his part, saw the experiment as a route to the Philosophers\u2019\nStone that he was seeking: \u201cI believe that this gold thus prepared, being dissolved in\nthe eau hyliale (hyleal water) extracted from antimony and mercury sublimate, one\npart upon six, and cooked according to art and the doctrine of the Cosmopolite,\nwould be rendered highly exalted for the medicine of bodies both human and\nmetallic.\u201d (The phrase \u201cmedicine of bodies both human and metallic\u201d is a circumlocution for the Stone, which was reputed to be both a universal medicine for\nhuman health and a means of \u201ccuring\u201d the imperfections of the base metals, thus\nturning them into gold.) Duclos also suggested that a concave mirror\u2014a device that\nhe and other French chymists were experimenting with at the time\u2014might be used\nto reflect the rays of sun and moon more powerfully, and questioned whether burial\nin the earth was really necessary. He even linked the results to the cryptic utterances\n46\nBNU MS 370, fol. 39v; Digby\u2019s \u2018loose papers\u2019 have not survived, unless they are bound\nsomewhere amid the 6000 pages of the newly-discovered Digby manuscripts.\n47\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol.

Jacques Caillard the Elder is mentioned by Michel de\nMarolles, abbe\u0301 Villeloin in his contemporaneous recounting of seventeenth-century Parisian\ngoldsmiths, see Marolles, Livre des peintres et graveurs, 57 and 126; he is also mentioned in a\nParisian baptismal register dating from 1618, Archive de l\u2019art franc\u0327ais, 324.

Mater Luna. nutrix terra aer Vehiculum\u201d (\u201cThe father is the\nSun, the mother the Moon, the Earth is the Nurse, the air the vehicle\u201d).49 This\nprominent chymist thus linked the goldsmiths\u2019 practice with the theories of Michael\nSendivogius (\u201cthe Cosmopolite\u201d) and Hermes. Duclos\u2019s ideas may well have\ncycled back into modified trials by others in the circle, and very possibly by the\ngoldsmiths as well.\nFurther insight on the place of goldsmiths in the Parisian chymical scene is\nprovided by diary entries made by Borrichius from 1663 to 1665. Amid his frequent\nvisits to natural philosophers, professors, theologians, and various well-known\nParisian curiosi, Borrichius also made no fewer than eight visits to an \u201cingenious\ngoldsmith and jeweller\u201d and \u201cnoteworthy investigator\u201d [curiosus insignis] by the\nname of Rosselle, who also visited him twice in return.50 This \u201cRosselle\u201d is\npresumably one of five gold- and silversmiths by the name of Roussel known to\nhave been active in Paris in the 1660s. Borrichius\u2019 description of him as \u201cgoldsmith\nand jeweler\u201d suggests that he was Claude Roussel (d.1678) who bore the title of\norfe\u0300vre joaillier ordinaire du roi, although this identification must remain provisional.51 On some visits Roussel displayed marvels of artifice, on others he showed\ndevices (such as a special lamp furnace) or techniques (such as a simple method of\nassaying minerals) of his own design. Most frequently, the topic of conversation\nwas chymistry, sometimes pharmaceutical in nature but more usually\ntransmutational. Some of these processes Roussel had devised himself, some he\nhad gathered from others. The information he relayed clearly attests to the goldsmith\u2019s connections and exchanges with a range of contacts both in Paris and across\nNorthern Europe. He tells for example of having purchased four ounces of\nchymically-produced gold from an unspecified German court, and of having\nreceived eight grains of chymical gold from the dispensator domus of the Duchesse\nd\u2019Aiguillon (1604\u20131675).52 If this last report is accurate, these few grains of gold\nwould certainly have been scraped from a fragment of gold supposedly made by the\n(in)famous Noe\u0308l Picard, called Dubois, in 1636 at the court of Louis XIII. The\nDuchesse had obtained the gold from her uncle, Cardinal Richelieu, who was\npresent at the transmutation, and who eventually had Dubois imprisoned and\nhanged when he could not make good on his promise to provide the cash-strapped\nmonarch with a weekly supply of precious metal.53\n49\nBNU MS 370, fol. 41r\u2013v.\n\u201cInvisi Dn.

Likewise, on 22 November 1664, Borrichius found Roussel in the\ncompany of \u201ca certain Flemish chymist named Regius\u201d and the three discussed Van\nHelmont (1579\u20131644) together.\nGoldsmiths and Chrysopoeia in England\nSeveral connections complete the third side of the Amsterdam-Paris-London triangle of chymical exchange. Digby of course maintained correspondence with his\ncountrymen at home, and, more significantly, travelled back to England in 1654\u2013\n1655 when it seemed briefly possible that Catholics would be tolerated by the\nCommonwealth. During this time, Digby continued his chymical interests in direct\ncontact with Hartlib and members of his circle such as Clodius, George Starkey\n(1628\u20131665), and Robert Boyle (1627\u20131691), to whom he communicated results\nand observations gathered in Paris. At present I have not uncovered any goldsmiths\nwho contributed actively to the chymical conversations of Hartlibians in London in\nways akin to what Grill did in the Netherlands, and Caillart, Roussel, and others did\nin Paris. Nevertheless, interactions of gold- and silversmiths with members of the\nLondon circle are not entirely absent, and serve to illustrate an alternate way in\nwhich goldsmiths were involved in the chymical world.\nProbably the most talented chymist of the English branch of this international\nnetwork was Starkey, the Bermuda-born and Harvard-educated emigre\u0301 who had\narrived in London from Massachusetts in 1650 and quickly became a celebrity\namong Hartlibians and a particular friend and teacher in chymical matters to\nBoyle. Starkey was a microcosm of the broad chymical world of the seventeenth\ncentury. He was talented in both theory and practice, and applied himself to\nvirtually every branch of chymistry: he sought the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and\nmetallic transmutation, he endeavored to prepare new chymical medicines, he\nmade ends meet (sometimes) by manufacturing perfumes, cosmetics, essential\noils, and distilled liquors, by practicing medicine, and by working in mining and\nrefining operations.55 It was his potentially lucrative transmutational chymistry\u2014\nand his supposed relationship with a successful adept named Eirenaeus\nPhilalethes\u2014that particularly attracted attention, and it is in this context that\ngold- and silversmiths appear.\n54\nBorrichius, Itinerarium, vol. IV, 132.\nNewman, Gehennical Fire; Newman &amp; Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire; and Starkey,\nAlchemical Laboratory Notebooks.\n55\n\nPages 197:\n176\nL.M. Principe\nIn 1651, Hartlib reported that Starkey had successfully prepared silver from\nantimony. But Starkey\u2019s silver \u201cwas in weight equal to Gold,\u201d that is, it was the\nchymical product called luna fixa, a metal with the appearance of silver, but the\ndensity and chemical properties of gold. The three collaborators\u2014Worsley in\nLondon and Moriaen and Grill in Amsterdam\u2014Hartlib reported, \u201cundertake to\nturne that Antimonial silver into Gold.\u201d56 One of Digby\u2019s associates, Dr. Farrar,\nsoon appeared, or in Starkey\u2019s own words, \u201cCame Gaping\u201d to Starkey\u2019s laboratory\nto see for himself, and reportedly attempted (unsuccessfully) to purchase the\nprocess for the princely sum of 5,000 pounds. Yet despite such a promising process,\nfrom which Hartlib and his associate John Dury reckoned Starkey could \u201ceasily\nmake [. . .] 300 lb a year,\u201d Starkey still encountered difficulty. As he reported to\nBoyle, the weight of the silver\ndid distract the Cockscombes of almost 20 refiners &amp; Goldsmiths to whom I showed the\nsilver, who all liked it, but stood amazed at the weight, &amp; so desired an assay of it, at the\npublique hal, which I was unwilling to, because of publiquenes, for every one (not one in at\nleast 16 missing) did say it was Philosophick silver, insomuch that I Could have wished it in\nthe Sea.57\nHartlib recorded that Starkey\nwas greatly vexed to have to abandon a lump of his silver at the goldsmith\u2019s. Several of\nthem marveled that it was so unlike other silver. Finally he met one who paid him what he\nasked. But Mr. Worsley advised that it was dangerous to sell it to a goldsmith and that it\nshould be brought to the mint.58\nThis account even reappears, with some embellishment, in Secrets Reveal\u2019d, a\ncryptic, extremely popular, and posthumously published work about making the\nPhilosophers\u2019 Stone that Starkey wrote under the persona of his fictive adept\nEirenaeus Philalethes. There \u201cPhilalethes\u201d laments the fate of the successful\ntransmuter, for he will find it dangerous or impossible to sell any gold or silver\nhe makes because the goldsmiths will always detect its superiority to ordinary gold\nor silver and demand to know where it came from. Philalethes recounts that once\nwhen he tried to sell some silver that he had transmuted, the goldsmith immediately\nsaid it was chymical; \u201cwhich when we heard, we prively withdrew, and left both the\nSilver and the price of it, never more demandable.\u201d59 Thus in Starkey\u2019s case, the\nexpertise of gold- and silversmiths was seen not as a source of information or\ncollaboration, but rather as an obstacle to making a comfortable alchemical living.\n56\nHartlib, Ephemerides 1651, HP 28/2/18A.\nStarkey to Boyle, c.

Curiously this is virtually the only entry in the\nEphemerides that Hartlib wrote in German, perhaps to preserve secrecy about such an apparently\ndangerous undertaking.

First, it is clear that several gold- and\nsilversmiths were active members of the network. Rather than merely being a\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry. While not erased, the\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.\nThe diversity of characters within the network and their various connections and\ncollaborations revises still-prevalent views of alchemical laborers as characteristically solitary, secretive, and isolated. Indeed, when we consider the reports of\nGrill\u2019s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators, it is hard not to recall\nthe contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre\npainting that almost always depict a foregrounded main experimenter with a group\nof other workers in the background tending various processes. While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them. The image\nof a busy, and presumably compartmentalized and hierarchical, chymical workshop\npulls our understanding of these locales towards a comparison with contemporaneous artisanal ateliers, which, if the principals involved were themselves artisans,\nwould have been the obvious model upon which to draw virtually automatically.\n(Interestingly, a modern academic chemical research group retains much of this\ncharacter and structure.) The transconfessional and international character of the\nlarger network\u2014which included Catholics and assorted types of Protestants, as well\nas Dutch, French, English, Danes, Swedes, and Germans\u2014parallels the way in\nwhich it cut across social levels. This situation complicates some of the standard\nways in which historians are accustomed to draw reckoning lines, and recalls the\nideal of a respublica litterarum even in a subject as distant from traditional\nhumanism as s\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 180 to page 198 out of a total of 220.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The partial summary provided covers pages 180 to 198 of *Laboratories of Art*, focusing on the activity of artisans, particularly goldsmiths, within alchemical circles:

- <strong>Goldsmiths and Alchemy</strong>: Gold- and silversmiths were involved in various alchemical practices, such as refining and transmutation of metals. Their work required knowledge of alchemical processes like distillation, fusion, and quartation. These artisans often collaborated with alchemists and contributed to transmutational projects, particularly those focused on turning base metals into precious ones.

- <strong>Network of Alchemists</strong>: Goldsmiths like Anthoni and Andries Grill were part of a network that connected Amsterdam, Paris, and London. This network included artisans and scholars who exchanged ideas and practices, documenting their work in letters. The Grill brothers’ work, especially in Sweden, showed the integration of artisanal expertise with theoretical alchemical knowledge, leading to financial success and high social standing.

- <strong>Role in Transmutation</strong>: Goldsmiths often acted as expert witnesses in verifying transmutations, and their workshops were equipped with the necessary tools for alchemical work. Notably, they participated in experiments that aimed to transmute metals, such as silver from tin. Some even developed their own methods for refining and producing metals, as seen with Anthoni Grill’s work in Sweden.

Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success.

Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181\nPages: 181\na variety of chymically-based projects, and, crucially for such a project as this one,\nthis network left behind a wealth of written records that provide historians with the\nnecessary clear evidence from which to work. I will therefore focus here on the\nchymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group and their interactions\nwith its other members and with the broader realms of chymistry.\nAnthoni and Andries Grill in the Netherlands and Sweden\nOne part of this network has already been extensively studied, namely the portion\ngathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662) in London.8 The\nHartlib Circle\u2019s utopian, educational, and commercial schemes made chymistry a\nsubject of particular interest due to its lucrative potential. An important contact in\nthis regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591\u20131668) in\nAmsterdam.

Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

In\nthe early modern period the alchemist was often portrayed as a fraud. The portrayals\nof laboratory scenes building on Brueghel became a genre of its own in the\nNetherlands.17 In these scenes, the alchemist is a goldmaker searching in vain for\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone and riches. As Tara Nummedal has convincingly shown,\nthe portrayal of the alchemist as a fraud also created the opportunity for other\nalchemists to fashion themselves in the role of experts, offering their services to\ncourts and other patrons to help them unmask fraudulent alchemists.18 Alchemical\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14,15\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15\nFor reading and writing as alchemical practices, see Nummedal, \u201cWords and Works,\u201d and the\nliterature quoted there.\n16\nNewman, Promethean Ambitions, 115\u201363.\n17\nPrincipe &amp; DeWitt, Transmutations, 11\u201327.\n18\nFor experts and entrepreneurial alchemy, see Nummedal, Alchemy and Authority, 40\u20135.\nxiv\nIntroduction\nIt is in this context of alchemical expertise that we should consider the artisans\nwho adopted the language of alchemy in the early modern period to attract the\nattention of patrons.

On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=9\nPages: 9,10\n\u201cmade by alchemy\u201d according to Cennino Cennini (c.1370\u2013c.1440).

In the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the term laboratorium uniquely referred to workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed: smelting, combustion,\ndistillation, dissolution, and precipitation. Matteo Martelli has convincingly\nshown that no such term was available in Antiquity.5 The Papyri, containing recipes]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=53\nPages: 53,54\npresence of such instructions is more probably related to a certain attraction of\nalchemy for some monks or friars. Previous studies indeed have established that,\neven if the practice of alchemy was forbidden by several monastic orders, many of\ntheir members were at the root of alchemical (compilations of) texts and Practica.27\nInventories of their library also inform us that they possessed alchemical treatises\n24\nCe\u0301zard, \u201cAlchimie et les recettes techniques,\u201d 6.\nEamon, Secrets of Nature, 36.\n26\nPrincipe &amp; Newman, \u201cHistoriography of Alchemy,\u201d 398\u2013400.\n27\nTheisen, \u201cAttraction of Alchemy.\u201d See also Barthe\u0301lemy, Alchimie de Guillaume Sedacer, 26\u20138.\n25\n30\nS.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>network of alchemists</strong> during the Renaissance was not an isolated endeavor but rather a highly collaborative and international system of exchange. Here are key points on the topic:

1. <strong>Artisans and Alchemists</strong>:
   Goldsmiths and silversmiths, such as Anthoni and Andries Grill, were part of a network that connected artisans with prominent alchemists. These individuals worked across Amsterdam, Paris, London, and Sweden, exchanging both theoretical and practical knowledge related to metal refinement, transmutation, and other chymical (early chemical) processes. These networks allowed for the blending of artisanal expertise with scholarly pursuits in alchemy.

   This network extended beyond artisans to include figures like Kenelm Digby, Samuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber, who were leading chymical practitioners. Collaborations were frequent and well-documented, as individuals shared experimental results, resources, and theoretical insights across borders. The Parisian goldsmiths, for example, were part of this broader network, linking artisans with leading chymical thinkers.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Several Parisian goldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged experimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby, Samuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 178](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178).

3. <strong>Samuel Hartlib and the Hartlib Circle</strong>:
   The Hartlib Circle in London played a central role in promoting chymistry, particularly in the context of its utopian and commercial ambitions. Johann Moriaen in Amsterdam was a significant contact within this network, facilitating the exchange of chymical knowledge and helping artisans like the Grill brothers achieve financial and social success through their involvement in alchemical projects.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;One part of this network... was the portion gathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600–1662) in London... An important contact in this regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591–1668) in Amsterdam.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 181](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181).

This network of alchemists and artisans was crucial for the spread of alchemical knowledge across Europe, blending practical experimentation with theoretical inquiry.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>role of artisans, particularly gold- and silversmiths, in transmutation</strong> was significant in Renaissance alchemy. They were not only participants in these experiments but also served as expert witnesses and verifiers of the authenticity of transmuted metals. Here are key insights:

1. <strong>Participation in Transmutational Efforts</strong>:
   Goldsmiths were frequently involved in the actual processes of attempting to transmute base metals, like lead or tin, into precious metals such as gold and silver. Their practical experience with metals and their knowledge of metal refinement made them crucial collaborators in these alchemical experiments.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Gold- and silversmiths figure prominently in many examples of the genre of ‘transmutation histories’... such artisans are routinely called in to assay a sample of the gold or silver produced, and thus act as expert witnesses to its authenticity.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 181](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181)

2. <strong>Alchemical Networks</strong>:
   Transmutational alchemy was part of a broader network that included both artisans and alchemists. For example, the Grill brothers, prominent silversmiths, participated in these transmutational experiments, highlighting the blending of practical expertise with alchemical theory.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Anthoni Grill’s Amsterdam laboratory also produced work on transmutation for high-profile clients, and the brothers shared knowledge with alchemical practitioners across Europe.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 16](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16)

3. <strong>Verification of Success</strong>:
   Goldsmiths played a critical role in verifying whether a successful transmutation had occurred. Their knowledge of metal properties allowed them to confirm whether the newly produced metal had the qualities of gold or silver. This made them valuable to alchemists who needed validation for their work.

Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198,199\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them. The image\nof a busy, and presumably compartmentalized and hierarchical, chymical workshop\npulls our understanding of these locales towards a comparison with contemporaneous artisanal ateliers, which, if the principals involved were themselves artisans,\nwould have been the obvious model upon which to draw virtually automatically.\n(Interestingly, a modern academic chemical research group retains much of this\ncharacter and structure.) The transconfessional and international character of the\nlarger network\u2014which included Catholics and assorted types of Protestants, as well\nas Dutch, French, English, Danes, Swedes, and Germans\u2014parallels the way in\nwhich it cut across social levels. This situation complicates some of the standard\nways in which historians are accustomed to draw reckoning lines, and recalls the\nideal of a respublica litterarum even in a subject as distant from traditional\nhumanism as sooty chymistry.\n178]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181\nPages: 181\na variety of chymically-based projects, and, crucially for such a project as this one,\nthis network left behind a wealth of written records that provide historians with the\nnecessary clear evidence from which to work.

Indeed, when we consider the reports of\nGrill\u2019s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators, it is hard not to recall\nthe contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre\npainting that almost always depict a foregrounded main experimenter with a group\nof other workers in the background tending various processes. While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them. The image]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=193\nPages: 193\nmanuscripts also reveal a wider circle of closely-knit chymists active in Paris\nthroughout the 1650s and 1660s. This circle included, besides Duclos and Digby,\nthe abbe\u0301 Jullien de Loberie (chaplain of the Colle\u0300ge Fortet) and an abbe\u0301 Boucaud,\nThomas Gobelin (member of a prominent family and counselor to the Paris\nParlement), the chymical authors Jean-Baptiste de la Noue, Pierre Borel, and\nFranc\u0327ois de Soucy, Sieur de Gerzan, as well as a host of others. The group shared\nmanuscripts, processes, and other information gathered from books or private\ncorrespondence, and collaborated (in various combinations) on practical chymical\nprocesses, most frequently of a transmutational nature. Some of them frequented\nwell-known intellectual groupings such as the academy of the abbe\u0301 Bourdelot.43\nThe travelling savants Borrichius and Henry Oldenburg (1619\u20131677) also\ninteracted with the group during their visits to Paris.\nSeveral documents record the participation of goldsmiths in this Parisian]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the\nallegorical images of widely varying artistic quality in chymical books and manuscripts imply some sort of contact between author/practitioner and artist. Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth. Yet none of these contacts tells us anything about possible\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nand in terms of identifying connections between them and the better documented\nand recognized work carried out in more visible and more intellectually elevated\ncircles.5 How did artists and artisans understand chymistry, and to what extent did\nthey practice it? To what extent were they familiar with more bookish or scholarly\nideas, practices, practitioners (and vice versa)? Can exchanges of knowledge\nbetween the two groups be clearly documented? Can we identify what practices,\nmaterials, or ideas passed between them, and how one group might have responded\nto information from the other? Answering such questions promises to further\nilluminate chymistry\u2019s cultural and intellectual place in early modern Europe.\nSome such connections seem relatively clear.

Further inquiries began to explore the vast bulk of manuscript and archival materials, with the result that the ambit of \u201cthe alchemist\u201d has\nbeen broadened to include practitioners representing the broadest possible range of\nearly modern people.4 University-educated physicians, natural philosophers, and\nscholars busied themselves with chymistry, as did a range of empirics, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts, as well as an assortment of artisans that included artists,\nmetalworkers, brewers, and cobblers.

Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture.\nIt was about the chemical production of things\u2014medicines, porcelain, dyes, and\nother products as well as the precious metals\u2014and about the knowledge of how to\nproduce them. In this sense, \u201cart technologies\u201d\u2014materials and techniques to make\nart and knowledge of these materials and techniques\u2014overlapped with alchemy.\nAlchemy has deep roots in writings on material transformation from Antiquity.\nThe productive knowledge associated with material transformation was written\ndown in recipe books.

When we consider\nchymistry as both a kind of knowledge, and an object-producing discipline, the\napplication of its techniques to reverse the process of making porcelain is a logical\nextension of the economic demand for china and the intellectual drive toward\nmaker\u2019s knowledge as expressed by Bacon.\nCertainly, the history of ceramics after the seventeenth century is inextricably\nlinked to chemistry\u2019s success at solving increasingly sophisticated questions of\nluxury pottery production.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div><strong>Chymical collaboration</strong> during the Renaissance was highly integrated, involving a variety of artisans, alchemists, and intellectuals who shared knowledge across practical and theoretical domains. Key points include:

1. <strong>Collaborations Between Artisans and Alchemists</strong>:
   Gold- and silversmiths were part of a network that worked with chymists (early modern chemists) to develop processes for refining and transmuting metals. These artisans were well-versed in chymical processes such as distillation, assaying, and fusion. Their workshops were often equipped with alchemical tools like furnaces and crucibles, allowing them to participate in both practical experimentation and theoretical inquiry.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Several Parisian goldsmiths were tied into this chymical network, exchanging experimental and theoretical information with figures like Kenelm Digby, Samuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 178](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178)

2. <strong>Chymical Networks Across Europe</strong>:
   These collaborations were international, with networks spanning cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, London, and beyond. Artisans like Anthoni and Andries Grill were key players in the Netherlands and Sweden, while figures like Johann Moriaen in Amsterdam connected with English chymists through the Hartlib Circle in London. These exchanges allowed for the widespread dissemination of both practical knowledge and alchemical theories.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;This network left behind a wealth of written records... crucially, it allowed for chymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group to be documented.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 181](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181)

3. <strong>Chymical Workshops</strong>:
   These networks led to large, collaborative chymical workshops where artisans, alchemists, and laborants worked side by side. For example, Anthoni Grill managed multiple laboratories, which were staffed by many operators working on refining and transmuting metals. This image of a busy, hierarchical workshop paralleled the structure of artisan ateliers and reflected the interdisciplinary nature of chymical and artisanal collaboration.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Grill’s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators resemble contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre painting.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 198](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198)

These chymical collaborations illustrate how early modern artisans and intellectuals crossed traditional boundaries to advance both alchemical and artisanal knowledge.

The portrayals\nof laboratory scenes building on Brueghel became a genre of its own in the\nNetherlands.17 In these scenes, the alchemist is a goldmaker searching in vain for\nthe Philosophers\u2019 Stone and riches. As Tara Nummedal has convincingly shown,\nthe portrayal of the alchemist as a fraud also created the opportunity for other\nalchemists to fashion themselves in the role of experts, offering their services to\ncourts and other patrons to help them unmask fraudulent alchemists.18 Alchemical\nexpertise was based on a broader knowledge of matter and materials.\n15]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual\ngenre. It finally suggests some clues to help locate, distinguish and demarcate\nalchemical content within the literature of recipes.\nArt and Alchemy Within Recipe Books\nAt first sight, any overlap between alchemy and art-technology within recipe books\ncan be broadly explained by the mutual use of various materials and substances\nsuch as \u201ccommon stones, gems, and types of marble, gold and other metals, sulfurs,\nsalts, and inks, azures, minium, and other colors, oils and burning pitches, and\ncountless other things.\u201d2 More precisely, the field of art-technology encompasses a\nlarge range of craft practices involved in the production of pieces of art (including\nthose which incorporate such substances). This \u2018hand\u2019 knowledge, is related to the\nmechanical arts and is divorced from the philosophical or speculative dimension.\nYet, alchemy could be described as the practical, philosophical and medical search]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=157\nPages: 157\npatron a keen interest in alchemy, was meant to have taken part\u2014but his premature\ndeath prevented his involvement. In the Studiolo the connection between alchemy\nand the chemical arts was exalted. The iconographic itinerary conceived by\nBorghini was situated in a sequence on the upper part of the wall where paintings\ndevoted to thermal baths, the discovery of gun powder, a glass works, a goldsmith\u2019s\nworkshop, alchemists and a bronze foundry were located; at the room\u2019s two ends\nwere two statues, portraying Vulcan and Apollo. On the lower part of the wall a\nmythological scene recalled Francesco I\u2019s alchemical and artistic interests.27 I\nwould like to stress the importance of a few elements directly or indirectly related\nto the chemical arts. What first strikes you in this particular arrangement is the\nproximity of Stradano\u2019s famous painting of Francesco I\u2019s alchemical laboratory and\nGiovanni Maria Butteri\u2019s (1540\u20131606) painting illustrating the glass works (Figs. 3\nand 4).]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=179\nPages: 179,180\nreferents, see Newman &amp; Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. Chemistry.\u201d\n2\nPrincipe, \u201cDiversity in Alchemy,\u201d and \u201cRobert Boyle and Isaac Newton.\u201d\n3\nOn the interplay of theory and practice in alchemy, see Newman &amp; Principe, Alchemy Tried in the\nFire, esp. 92\u2013206.\n4\nFor example, see Nummedal, Alchemy and Authority, which details the roles and status of\n\u2018entrepreneurial\u2019 chymists in German courts.

Most recently there has been particular\ninterest in exploring alchemy\u2019s place among artists and artisans, an investigation\nthat rightly reflects the crucial position of material production within chymistry\nthroughout its history. Important questions remain however in regard to demonstrating the specific theoretical and practical content of such artisanal endeavors,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=16\nPages: 16\nBeretta, were also early examples of such places of exchange, followed by many\nother European courts. These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nand in terms of identifying connections between them and the better documented\nand recognized work carried out in more visible and more intellectually elevated\ncircles.5 How did artists and artisans understand chymistry, and to what extent did\nthey practice it? To what extent were they familiar with more bookish or scholarly\nideas, practices, practitioners (and vice versa)? Can exchanges of knowledge\nbetween the two groups be clearly documented? Can we identify what practices,\nmaterials, or ideas passed between them, and how one group might have responded\nto information from the other? Answering such questions promises to further\nilluminate chymistry\u2019s cultural and intellectual place in early modern Europe.\nSome such connections seem relatively clear. Chymical workshops appear\nfrequently in Netherlandish genre painting, indicating that Northern artists were\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=160\nPages: 160\njewelry were the arts most closely connected with alchemy. Their connections\ninspired Francesco to create a new decorative scenario, dominated by alchemy,\nby which illustrate the relation between arts and nature.\nFrancesco was extremely keen, even more than his father, to promote the study\nof the natural sciences and the arts related to them. His passion for the chemical arts\nwas so strong that in 1560, when he was only 19, he was told off by his brother\nGiovanni for attending the works of the fonderia all day long.33 It was Francesco\nwho, in September 1569, charged the architect, engineer and inventor Bernardo\nBuontalenti (1531\u20131608), who had been one of his teachers since 1550, to oversee\nthe construction of Bortolo\u2019s new glass furnace and a new fonderia.34 Francesco I\nalso exploited Buontalenti\u2019s versatile skills in the works of the fusion of precious]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes. The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history.

So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>In the Renaissance, collaborations between artists and alchemists were significant, particularly within courtly settings such as the Medici courts, where the boundaries between art and alchemy were fluid. Key insights into these collaborations include:

1. <strong>Integration of Art and Alchemy in Workshops</strong>:
   At the Medici court, laboratories of art and alchemy were placed side by side to encourage collaboration between artists and scientists. Goldsmiths, jewelers, cabinetmakers, and sculptors regularly exchanged equipment and knowledge with alchemists. These collaborations involved both theoretical and practical knowledge, influencing the style and craftsmanship of the objects produced.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Laboratories of art and alchemy were placed side by side by the Grand Dukes Francesco I and Ferdinando I de’ Medici... Goldsmiths, jewellers, cabinetmakers, sculptors, painters, and cutters of semi-precious stones exchanged not only equipment, but also theoretical and technical knowledge with the alchemists.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 127](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=127).

2. <strong>Collaborations on Pigments and Metals</strong>:
   Artists and alchemists shared techniques for producing pigments, artificial gemstones, and refining metals. Alchemists provided specialized knowledge on processes like transmutation and the creation of metallic alloys, which artists used in their work. This mutual exchange of skills and knowledge contributed to innovations in materials used for decorative arts.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy can be defined as the ‘art of transmutation’... Both [alchemy and art] are concerned with the description of colors—especially in processes of change, the making of pigments, the production of artificial gemstones, and the imitation of gold and silver.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 47](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47).

3. <strong>Role of Recipe Books in Knowledge Exchange</strong>:
   Recipe books were an important medium through which alchemical and artistic knowledge circulated. These manuscripts documented processes for refining materials, preparing pigments, and creating decorative objects. The overlap between alchemical and artistic instructions highlights how the two fields were interconnected.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of both scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers or authorities.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 66](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=66).

This blending of art and alchemy fostered a dynamic environment where artistic creations were deeply informed by scientific and alchemical experimentation.

First, it is clear that several gold- and\nsilversmiths were active members of the network. Rather than merely being a\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry. While not erased, the\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.\nThe diversity of characters within the network and their various connections and\ncollaborations revises still-prevalent views of alchemical laborers as characteristically solitary, secretive, and isolated. Indeed, when we consider the reports of\nGrill\u2019s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators, it is hard not to recall\nthe contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre\npainting that almost always depict a foregrounded main experimenter with a group\nof other workers in the background tending various processes. While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them. The image\nof a busy, and presumably compartmentalized and hierarchical, chymical workshop\npulls our understanding of these locales towards a comparison with contemporaneous artisanal ateliers, which, if the principals involved were themselves artisans,\nwould have been the obvious model upon which to draw virtually automatically.\n(Interestingly, a modern academic chemical research group retains much of this\ncharacter and structure.) The transconfessional and international character of the\nlarger network\u2014which included Catholics and assorted types of Protestants, as well\nas Dutch, French, English, Danes, Swedes, and Germans\u2014parallels the way in\nwhich it cut across social levels. This situation complicates some of the standard\nways in which historians are accustomed to draw reckoning lines, and recalls the\nideal of a respublica litterarum even in a subject as distant from traditional\nhumanism as sooty chymistry.\n\nPages 199:\n178\nL.M.

This\npaper endeavors to shift the focus from an externally driven developmental process\nand relocate the principal method of innovation within the experimental framework\nestablished by early modern chymistry. Evidence for the use of thermal experimentation will be considered as a foundational element toward a chymical solution\nto the problem of porcelain production. Excavated material from the workshop of\nthe seventeenth century English arcanist John Dwight and the published experiments of the seventeenth century Silesian natural philosopher Ehrenfried Walther\nvon Tschirnhaus will provide the basis for this examination. This material, along\nwith the thermal elements unique to the successful Meissen porcelains will be used\nto frame the initial comparisons of the technological differences between the\nEuropean and Far Eastern productions, and serve to pose further questions regarding the impact of experimental techniques and limitations on European porcelain\narcanistry.\nUntil recently the study of early modern ceramics was principally the domain of art\nhistorians and archaeologists, limiting the scope of questions being posed by\nacademics. Increasingly the role of natural philosophy, medieval alchemy and\nnascent chemistry in ceramic evolution has been revealed, bringing with it the\nnecessity to align discourse on ceramic practice with the discipline of history of\nscience, as art history lacks the framework to pose questions that would advance the\ndiscussion. This paper is an exploratory work that builds the foundations to bridge\nthose separate traditions to expedite a more consilient examination of ceramic\ntechnology and innovation.

Wesley\nchymical practices in early modern ceramic innovation that lead to a drastic\nreshaping of the experimental landscape. While many adopted practices flowed\nseamlessly between the two disciplines through shared tools and techniques developed by generations of practitioners working with fire, the specific nature of\nceramics forced adaptations on other practices. Elements borrowed from controversial chymical fire analysis found more specific application in investigating\nthermal qualities of ceramic bodies in laboratory experimentation. Used in ceramic\ninvestigations in England and Saxony during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, this hybrid approach was a defining moment in high-fire European\nceramic production.\nThe recent change in terminology surrounding medieval and early modern\ndistinctions between alchemy, chymistry and chemistry is particularly significant\nin informing the need for similar clarifications in discussions of historic porcelains.1\nAs a more extensive network of documentary sources related to early modern\nEuropean ceramics is assembled, the mercurial nature of the term \u2018porcelain\u2019 is\nincreasingly cast into the spotlight. From the traditionally ascribed basis in records\nof Marco Polo\u2019s (c.1254\u20131324) voyage, different interpretations have existed, and\nno substantial historic reconciliation has been attempted. It is beyond the scope of\nthis paper to attempt to do so, but establishing a basic set of terms is necessary. The\nterm \u2018porcelain\u2019 will be employed to denote white, translucent, high-firing ceramic\nbodies, consistent with the material described by Polo and exported from China into\nEurope.2 Two subdivisions will further be mentioned in this text; those objects\nmade through a combination of kaolinized clay and alkali salt rich stone will be\nreferred to as \u2018hard-paste\u2019, while objects made of a combination of clay and ground\nglass, sand, or quartz flux will be viewed as \u2018soft-paste\u2019. These are entirely modern\nseparations, used here for clarity, and specific examples given in the following\npaper will demonstrate they are not historic terms.\nThe seventeenth and eighteenth century quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain\nborrowed not only techniques from the chymical tradition, but even notions of\nhigher arcana. This notion of the adept\u2019s knowledge dovetails with the terminology\nemployed within the Saxon court of Augustus II the Strong (1670\u20131733) as\nprogress towards commercial European porcelain was made. The term arcanum\nis employed in court records and correspondence as it related to the porcelain\nsecret, and those individuals working to produce porcelain bodies were certainly\npossessed of substantial industrial secrets, making them, fittingly, arcanists.3 While\nscholars have pointed out that the term arcanum is not strictly limited to alchemical\npursuits, being widely employed within the book of secrets tradition during the later\n1\nNewman &amp; Principe, \u201cAlchemy vs. Chemistry.\u201d\nOriginally composed as Livres des merveilles du monde, the original manuscript was purportedly\ncomposed by Rustichello while he shared imprisonment with Marco Polo after the latter\u2019s return to\nVenice in 1295 AD. A full discussion of Polo\u2019s references to porcelain can be found in Carswell,\nBlue and White, 52\u20134.\n3\nFor the full correspondence, see Tschirnhaus, Amtliche Schriften, ch. II.\n2\n\nPages 203:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n183\nmedieval and early modern periods, in the context of porcelain, strong arguments\ncan be made towards the artisanal-alchemical bridge. The correspondences that\nremain in the archives at Dresden, originate from that alchemical tradition, to the\nextent that arguments have been leveled to suggest that the correspondence was, in\nfact, about the creation of the Philosophers\u2019 Stone rather than a search for the\ncomposition of porcelain. While later arcanists cannot be seen to participate in\ntransmutational alchemy on more than an individual level, the origination of the\nterm in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is clearly linked to those\npursuits. Further, it should be noted that these first arcanists are entirely separate\nfrom communities and guilds of potters in their various regions, offering an entirely\nnovel actor class that appears at the end of the seventeenth century, chymists whose\nfocus was on the production of translucent ceramics rather than metallurgical,\nmedical, or other natural philosophical avenues.\nNo evidence towards production of a hard-paste porcelain body by European\npotters before the eighteenth century is extant, leaving the chymist\u2019s laboratory as\nthe principle space of ceramic innovation. Specific investigation of the physical\nproperties of Chinese porcelain undertaken by John Dwight (c.1633\u20131704) and\nEhrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708) represent the first successful\nexamples of chymistry\u2019s methodological apparatus being directed toward porcelain\ninnovation. Thermal experiment was an important element in the practices of both\nindividuals and evidence presented in the archaeological record demonstrates\nDwight\u2019s re-firing of Chinese sherds while Tschirnhaus published results of the\nexperimental application of burning lenses to determine the physical properties of\nvaried ceramic bodies. Dwight was ultimately unsuccessful in his endeavors, likely\ndue to economic realities, while Tschirnhaus\u2019s work would lay the cornerstones for\nthe eventual production of Meissen porcelain.\nThe Potter\u2019s Art as Craft Practice\nTo understand why the shift from the intellectual space of the craft workshop to the\nchymical laboratory was critical to the advancement of European ceramic development, an examination of the awkward position of pottery within the hierarchy of\nthe decorative arts before the early modern period is worthwhile. Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production. Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products. Vannoccio\nBiringuccio\u2019s (1480\u2013c.1539) introduction to his brief \u201cdiscourse on the art of the\npotter\u201d from his Pirotechnia of 1540, encapsulates both the recent recognition\nreceived by ceramic craft and its inseparability from fire:\n\nPages 204:\n184\nM. Wesley\nHaving started to tell you of working potter\u2019s clay for making crucibles and shells, the wish\ncame to me to tell you of the practice of this art also. Although it may seem at first glance to\nbe outside the order and purpose of my writing, he who considers well will see that it is not\nunrelated to it but proper, since it is wholly dependent on the agency and power of fire if it is\nto be brought to its perfection. Moreover, the potter\u2019s glazes and colors are all substances of\nvarious metals or impure minerals and therefore belong to fire. Since it is my intention to\ntreat of fire, minerals, and metals for you, I surely should not have omitted this, particularly\nbecause it is a necessary art which enriches and is greatly praised both for its ingenuity and\nits beauty.4\nLike the other arts treated in the Pirotechnia, the action of the fire on base earths\nand minerals provided integral transformation in the objects shaped by the potter\u2019s\nhands. At the time of Biringuccio\u2019s writing, the potter\u2019s art was on the threshold of a\nparadigm shift that would create a marked division between craft knowledge and\ntheory based practice, setting two separate courses for ceramic innovation in the\nlater sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. His citation of alchemy as one of \u201ctwo\nsources as [pottery\u2019s] principal basis,\u201d is referential to the provision of purified\nminerals and \u201celemental mixtures.\u201d5 However, it also foreshadowed the intellectual\nengagement of chymists in the quest for the production of European porcelain,\nbringing the weight of the older alchemical tradition to bear.\nPrior to the fourteenth century, European pottery was external to the hierarchy of\nthe esteemed arts, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, painting, and dyeing. The\nextensively copied treatise De diversis artibus, composed in the thirteenth century\nby the Benedictine monk Theophilus, thoroughly introduces the full range of\nartisanal productions valued in Europe in its first book.6 Pottery is entirely absent\nfrom this discussion of laudable arts and only appears once in the text as a canvas\nfor enameling.7 This is a continuation of pottery\u2019s position in the classical period,\nwhen earthen objects were valued as trade goods, everyday wares, or a medium for\nother decoration, not for their individual aesthetic form.8\nIt was not until advancements in the production of luxury quality European\npottery during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that the cultural perception of\nthe material changed significantly, driving engagement by the upper classes and\nnatural philosophers. An example can be found in a letter from Lorenzo de Medici\n(1449\u20131492) to the Malatesta family in 1490, favorably comparing their gift of\nmaiolica to silver objects, which is one of the earliest pieces of documentary\n4\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 392.\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 392.\n6\nFor various editions of the treatise, see Theophilus, Essay Upon Various Arts (1847), The Various\nArts (1961), and On Diverse Arts (1963).\n7\n\u201cQuam si diligentius perscruteris, illic inuenies quicquid in diuersorum colorum generibus et\nmixturis habet Graecia, quicquid in electrorum operositate seu nigelli uarietate nouit Ruscia,\nquicquid ductili uel fusili seu interrasili opere distinguit Arabia, quicquid in uasorum diuersitate\nseu gemmarum ossiumue sculptura auro decorat Italia, quicquid in fenestrarum pretiosa uarietate\ndiligit Francia, quicquid in auri, argenti, cupri et ferri lignorum lapidumque subtilitate sollers\nlaudat Germania.\u201d (Theophilus, The Various Arts (1961), 4).\n8\nOn the relative value of the potter\u2019s work, see Boardman, \u201cTrade in Greek Decorated Pottery.\u201d\n5\n\nPages 205:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n185\nevidence demonstrating the elevation of pottery into the canon of decorative arts.9\nWithin the next two decades, the production of new types of earthenware spread\nacross Italy rapidly replacing vernacular wares, such as those traditionally produced\nin Orvieto and Montelupo.\nAs the sixteenth century progressed the demand for porcelain, introduced in\nsmall quantities during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, exploded alongside a\nburgeoning maritime trade. While the first successful efforts to produce a ceramic\nbody that replicated some of porcelain\u2019s qualities were those of the Medici workshops between 1575 and 1587, they failed to produce hard paste porcelain that was\nsimultaneously durable and heat resistant.10 Medici porcelain has long been\nconnected to the alchemical interests of Francesco I de Medici (1541\u20131587) though\nit required external aid. This outside knowledge was provided by an unknown\nLevantine leading to the production of a glassy porcelain body that is closely\nrelated to Islamic fritwares, but not Chinese material.11\nIt would take another 130 years before the commercialization of a hard paste\nporcelain body at the Meissen factory in Saxony. The reason for this significant lag\nin production cannot be connected to a lack of proper resources or technology, as\nhighly kaolinized clay sources, identical to the China clay that the Jesuit priest Pe\u0300re\nFrancois Xavier d\u2019Entrecolles (1664\u20131741) would write about in 1712, were\nexploited for the production of Hessian crucibles for laboratories across Europe\nas early as the fourteenth century.12 Arguments that the recipes and manufacturing\nprocesses of crucibles, such as those produced at Hesse, would have been closely\nguarded secrets must be considered a contributing factor in the reduced awareness\nof European potters as to the suitability of such clay for the production of a high\nfiring body. Those arguments can only be validated by assuming that ceramics did\nindeed exist apart from the other arts of fire at this period; for observations by\nchymists, metallurgists and glassmakers on the properties of the crucibles, and\nindeed the entire basis for the valuable export trade of Hessian crucibles, was of\ntheir highly refractory, hard firing nature.\nThe situation again suggests that the lack of a craft practice-based solution to the\nproduction of porcelain hindered progress in European investigations, in contrast to\nthe gradual evolution of the Far Eastern wares through extended refinement within\npottery communities in China and later Korea and Japan.13 Potters in those regions,\nthrough wider access to materials and support were able to utilize the full range of\n9\nFor a specific discussion of the social standing of this material, see Wilson, \u201cLe maioliche.\u201d\nKingery &amp; Vandiver, Masterpieces, 141.\n11\nLiverani, Porcellane dei Medici, 8, 47, discusses the mysterious Levantine, while referring to\nKingery &amp; Vandiver, Masterpieces, 141, for related material analyses and comparisons with\ncontemporary examples Islamic fritwares and Chinese porcelains.

Wesley\nclay native to the region, slowly perfecting what was considered an important art\nform. The long period of development in the Far East allowed incremental refinements necessary for successful innovations through craft practice. With a limited\ntime span driven by the demand for the material in Europe, the interrogative\ntechniques of the chymist\u2019s laboratory were necessary to circumvent the slower,\nless focused workshop process.\nExperiment and Fire Analysis\nAs discussed, the primary hindrance on the production of a porcelain body was the\nlack of identified materials that could be combined to produce these translucent,\nhigh fire, ceramic objects. The production of material at Hesse and the later\ndiscovery of kaolinic clay in Cornwall, England, again demonstrate that Europe\ndid not lack the raw materials, but rather that potters were unaware of the properties\nof those materials, even though other artisans were making use of them. The failure\nwas thus not connected to any form of geological predetermination, but entirely by\nsocial constraints limiting the application of knowledge to the problem.\nThe speculation that porcelain was comprised of either special clay, fermented\nfor generations, or of crushed shell incorporated in its manufacture, was a direct\nindication that similar materials were outside the realm of contemporary craft\nknowledge.14 In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental\ntechniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as\nprototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition. It is at this\npoint that the techniques employed by chymistry, some borrowed from metallurgical assaying and the furnaces of the glassmakers in the centuries-long discourse\nbetween the disciplines, came into full application in the pursuit of ceramic\ninnovation.\nDue to the highly resistant nature of porcelain to analysis via distillation, the\napplication of direct heat was the recourse of both Dwight and Tschirnhaus. While\ntheir techniques were radically different, applying the heat of the furnace and the\nenergy of the sun respectively, the basic principles of this thermal experiment was\nclosely linked to the long-standing application of chymical fire analysis.\nThe exposure of both Dwight and Tschirnhaus to fire analysis during their\nstudies at university can be situated within a larger debate regarding the legitimacy\nof the process during the seventeenth century. The ultimate goal of separating\nbodies into their constituent components and, ideally, recombining them through\nthe application of fire, was assailed on a methodological and philosophical level in\n14\nThe speculation regarding the extended fermentation of clay and the addition of \u2018artificial\nminerals\u2019 to Chinese porcelain comes from Bacon, New Organon, Book II, Aph. 50.\n\nPages 207:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n187\nthe writings of the chymists.15 Supporters, such as Daniel Sennert (1572\u20131637),\nargued that it presented the most effective means of resolution, provided that\nviolent reactions were avoided in favor of distillation and more subtle applications\nof heat. While Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) described the action of fire on the\nprinciples of a body as something that \u201cconfounds\u201d in that \u201cmany natures which\nare in fact newly brought out and superinduced by fire and heat.\u201d16 Similarly Robert\nBoyle (1627\u20131691) questioned the role of fire in analysis, based on the uncertainty\nof its ability to alter rather than separate substances.17 This position of Boyle\u2019s can\nbe viewed as somewhat problematic, considering the American chymist George\nStarkey\u2019s (1628\u20131665) extensive influence on his early research. Starkey\u2019s notebooks contain extensive application of fire analysis to test various experiments,\nwith the notation refutata per ignem appearing multiple times.18\nDebus clearly argues that the debate over the acceptability of fire analysis was\nclosely linked to the ongoing conflict being waged against Aristotelian thought in\nthe seventeenth century.19 As such many of the arguments against, from an empirical standpoint, must be viewed as couched within that particular political rhetoric.\nWithin the practices of Dwight and Tschirnhaus, their education in chymistry points\nto a profound awareness of the controlled application of fire in laboratory practice,\nbut more practical demands circumvented their full engagement within the Aristotelian debate and records of their work support the notion that fire became a critical\ntool for interrogation of material, but as commentators have pointed out, no true fire\nanalysis could occur.\nConsidering the context of ceramics, the limiting factor of fire analysis must\nnecessarily be in its inability to undo changes in crystalline structure during the\ninitial firing of an object. Because of these phase shifts, the specific components of a\nceramic body resist resolution by thermal or chemical means, making the original\nmaterials inscrutable. Even with modern scanning electron microscopy only an\nanalysis of the volumes of base elements is available (though insight into crystalline\nstructure is provided); establishing a definitive source or recipe for the ware prior to\nfiring is frequently impossible. Dwight and Tschirnhaus were subject to substantially greater limitations, with the possible attributes available for their analysis\nrestricted to: temperature of vitrification, point of liquefaction and failure of the\nbody, separation of glaze and body material in phases, and reaction of any applied\ndecorations in a manner different to the body or glaze. This limited access to deeper\nstructures would demand that any speculation as to source or recipe would have to\n15\nThe essay by Debus, \u201cFire Analysis,\u201d encapsulates much of the instability related to fire analysis\nas it appears in the major texts of the seventeenth century, while Newman, Promethean Ambitions,\n251\u201362, revisits and furthers the discussion as it relates to the art-nature debate.\n16\nBacon, New Organon, Book II, Aph. 7.\n17\nBoyle, The Sceptical Chymist.\n18\nFor more on Boyle and Starkey\u2019s relationship and the work of Starkey as an experimentalist, see\nNewman &amp; Principe, Alchemy Tried in the Fire, 92\u2013128; and Newman, Gehennical Fire.\n19\nDebus, \u201cFire Analysis,\u201d 128\u201330.\n\nPages 208:\n188\nM. Wesley\nbe made with comparative data from other experiments on local raw materials, a\nroute that both men pursued aggressively, as discussed below.\nThat Bacon and Boyle were key figures in the debate regarding fire analysis had\na corollary impact on the advancement of ceramic innovation, and perhaps on the\nultimate failure to discover the arcanum in England. As the evidence of Dwight\u2019s\nexperimentation is considered, his links to Boyle and the influence of Bacon\u2019s\nwritings become increasingly important. Due to the restrictions of his fire analysis,\nhe was unable to disprove Bacon\u2019s speculation that there was an \u2018artificial mineral\u2019\nemployed in the production of porcelain, and his later experiments and workbooks\ndemonstrate that while he became intimately aware of the firing temperatures\nconnected to the Chinese prototypes he was able to secure, he never gave up on\nthe idea of a synthetic additive that would make clay into porcelain.\nJohn Dwight\u2019s Fulham Pottery: Chymical Beginnings\nDwight was the first individual to record limited success at producing porcelain in\nEngland. Born sometime between 1633 and 1635 in Gloucestershire, he was able to\nsecure a place at Oxford around 1655, leaving by 1660/1.20 Although officially\nreading for a Bachelor\u2019s of Ecclesiastical Law during this period, Dwight was\nemployed in the laboratory of Boyle.21 The influence of this period crucially shaped\nthe course of the young Dwight\u2019s life, as seen in his admission as an old man to Sir\nJohn Lowther, F.R.S. (1642\u20131706), who recounted in a letter to William Gilpen,\ndated 12 March 1697/8: \u201c[Dwight] gives this acct of himself yt he was bred at ye\nUniversity studyed Civil Law &amp; Physick a little, but most Chymistry [. . .].\u201d22\nThis period in Boyle\u2019s laboratory corresponds with Robert Hooke\u2019s (1635\u20131703)\nemployment there as an assistant and Dwight and Hooke remained friends throughout\ntheir lives. It also corresponds with the period that saw the influence of Johann\nRudolph Glauber\u2019s (c.1604\u20131670) Furni novi philosophici on Boyle and the employment of various analytical techniques shared between Boyle and Starkey.23 Dwight\nwas fluent in both Latin and English and would have had access to the full variety of\ntexts moving through the laboratory. It is reasonable to speculate that, as this period\ncoincided with Boyle\u2019s increasing blindness, Dwight may have been asked to deal\nwith this material critically as a reader given his facility with the language.\nAfter his time in Oxford, Dwight held an Ecclesiastical and Legal appointment to\nsuccessive Bishops of Chester, until a deteriorating relationship with the fourth to\nhold the title led to him leaving the post to open the Fulham Pottery in 1670/1.

This lack of documentary evidence as to Dwight\u2019s\nendeavors suggests that he was able to spend very little time in these pursuits, as\nwithin the same period his marriage was brought to fruition and a plethora of\ndocuments connected to this and his legal post remain. Some progress must have\nbeen made, as he was able to secure a royal patent for the production of porcelain for\nthe factory almost immediately in 1672 supported by Hooke and Boyle.24\nDespite the support of the Crown in the production of his wares, and the\nendorsements of individuals such as Hooke, the absence of any porcelain produced\nat the Fulham factory frustrated scholarship on Dwight for the majority of the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries turning the focus primarily to his stoneware\nproduction. Fortunately, the role of the factory in the history of English ceramics,\nand its continued operation until the twentieth century provided both the interest\nand possibility of substantial archaeological excavations undertaken by the Archaeological Section of the Fulham and Hammersmith Historical Society between 1971\nand 1979.25\nThese excavations revealed substantial information about many of Dwight\u2019s\nworking practices, the composition of both his finished and unfinished ceramics,\nand substantiated the claims that he had been actively working on producing\nporcelain in the Chinese style. Various strata were excavated, and unearthed\nmaterial covered virtually the entire operation of the pottery throughout its existence. The earliest period of experimentation and production, covering the years\n1671/2\u201374 was found \u201cconfined to a few Features in the south-east of the site (K15,\nK23, N1, and D3)\u201d with only very fragmentary material found in other areas.26\nIn these areas of early experimentation, a substantial sample of material of\nporcelaneous nature was discovered, all of which was fragmentary. Of this material,\nGreen notes that less than \u201cOne kilo in total weight was recovered but [represents] a\nlarge number of individual vessels.\u201d The dating is connected to its location, relative\nto other excavations, with important finds coming from the aforementioned southeast corner circa 1673 and a pair of soak ways that were filled circa 1676 (Fig. 1).27\nThese sherds represent a systematic, sustained, and varied approach towards\nporcelain experimentation, one that resulted in many failures, but there were other\nsmall successes towards a production of porcelain. They provide a wealth of\ntechnical evidence towards the experimentation conducted by Dwight during the\nearly period of the pottery, informing us specifically on the composition of his\n\u201cporcelane\u201d bodies, attempts and decoration, problems in glazing, and finally a\nvariety of firing issues.\n24\nThe patent was issued towards the protected manufacture of \u2018transparent Earthenware\u2019 and\n\u2018stone ware\u2019 by Charles the Second, on 17 April 1672, at Whitehall.

For example the fragment\nrepresented by type 36 clearly shows a division between the front and back of the\ntest chip (Green speculates that it is divided as \u2018iq r[ecto]/ iq v[erso]\u2019), as do types\n32, 34, and 48. It is a reasonable assumption, based on his later workbooks, that the\nvarious notations correspond to a notebook kept during the process of experimentation. This hypothesis is supported by the survival of two of Dwight\u2019s notebooks,\ncontaining various recipes and refinements. These two notebooks were of much\nlater date than the excavated material, written between 1689 and 1695. It is likely\nthat the latter was completed to hand down to his son Samuel Dwight, as an aid\ntowards the operation of the factory. While Samuel\u2019s later ownership of the\nnotebooks can only be speculated, the books themselves contained the signature\nof Lydia Dwight, claiming them as her own.\nModern knowledge of the two notebooks is due to the transcriptions by three\nindividuals. The primary transcription was executed by Lady Charlotte Schreiber\n(1812\u20131895), who discovered these two books during a visit to the pottery in 1870,\npainstakingly recording their contents in her own notebook. Excerpts were also\ncopied by William Chaffers (1811\u20131892) and Llewellyn Jewitt (1816\u20131886) for\npublication.28 While these two transcriptions lack the recipes for porcelain recorded\nby Lady Schreiber, they corroborate the rest of her transcription.\n28\nChaffers, Marks and Monograms; and Jewitt, Ceramic Art.\n\nPages 211:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n191\nFig. 2 Porcelain sherds,\ntwo identified as Green\u2019s\ntype 33 and 34 the other\nunrecorded, attributed to\nJohn Dwight, 1672\u20131673\n(Photograph by the author)\nThe current whereabouts of the two notebooks is unknown; they were sold\nthrough Christie\u2019s, likely in 1888 or 1889. Notices seeking their recovery have\nbeen remarked on as early as 30 June, 1894, but no indication as to their location has\nsurfaced.29\nWhile no contemporary records of the tests conducted between 1672 and 1675\nare known to exist, laboratory testing of the composition of the sherds found from\nthis period coincide broadly with the recipes given for porcelain in the later texts.\nThis methodology demonstrates the connection between Dwight\u2019s laboratory practice to that employed by Boyle in the late 1650s, and echoes the laboratory books of\nStarkey.30 Similar to the annotations and refinements demonstrated in Starkey\u2019s\nlaboratory books, we see Dwight actively editing his working notebook with\ncommentary on the effectiveness of recipes and the striking through of less effective formula. Lady Schreiber was rigorous in her transcriptions, making note of\npages torn out, recipes struck through, and duplicating marginalia such as a \u201cnot\nvery good\u201d accompanying a struck through recipe for \u201ca dark red porcellane or\nChina Cley\u201d dated 14 November, 1693.31\nThe second, arguably more interesting, group discovered within the context of\nsoakway A18, and thus contemporary to the test chips, was a group of Chinese\nexport porcelain sherds (Fig. 3). Among this group of blue and white sherds,\nrepresenting at least five distinct objects, are cases where glaze running over\nfractured edges demonstrate clear evidence of re-firing, at a temperature hot enough\nto at least partially liquefy the glaze, without burning the cobalt. A final sherd from\nthis group contains evidence of cobalt over-painting by Dwight, before re-firing,\nperhaps as a test coinciding with the samples of his own work.\n29\nSchreiber, Charlotte Schreiber\u2019s Notebook, 31; and Haselgrove &amp; Murray, \u201cDwight\u2019s Fulham\nPottery,\u201d 74.\n30\nFor the working practices, see Starkey, Alchemical Laboratory Notebooks.\n31\nReproduced in Haselgrove &amp; Murray, \u201cDwight\u2019s Fulham Pottery,\u201d 73, ai\u2013bviii, 74.\n\nPages 212:\n192\nM.

These fragments provided a tangible outcome for Dwight\u2019s experimentation,\nsources that could be used for active comparison in the laboratory. His test bodies\nand colors worked directly towards the production of material that mimicked the\nobservable qualities of the Chinese porcelain in his possession even though its\nchemical composition remained unknown.\nThose qualities clarify his distinct use of \u201ctransparent porcelane or China cley\u201d\nto describe certain recipes in his notebooks. While he employed \u201cporcelane\u201d as a\nwider term applicable to many finewares, it was transparency and whiteness that he\npursued through experimentation, as key properties of the sherds available to him.\nThe re-firing of Chinese material revealed the use of a distinct glaze layer over the\ncobalt itself, which demonstrated a distinct thermal response from the Chinese body\npaste. There may have been more sherds whose surfaces were destroyed by overfiring in a test furnace, but the remaining pieces show care taken to affect changes in\nthe glaze without damaging the fabric or the decoration, suggesting that, on a\nsmaller scale, Dwight had keen control over the temperatures of his experimentation. The bright, transparent nature of the Chinese glaze, combined with its excellent fit to the fabric of the ware, may have further influenced Dwight towards an\nessay discussing a theoretical lead China glaze, as it appears in his notebook,\ndemonstrating that his attempts to create an alkali glaze had failed, or if successful,\nhis solution remains one of the best kept secrets of European ceramics.\nHis application of thermal experimentation, as noted, was limited in its scope,\nbut still formed a critical point of departure for his investigation into the properties\nnecessary to replicate the Chinese materials. He combined these inquiries with\nknowledge of a wide range of raw materials available to potters in England.\n\nPages 213:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n193\nIn conversations recorded by Hooke in his diary, and referenced in at least one\nmeeting of the Royal Society on 5th December 1678, Dwight was vocal about the\nsuitability of various English clays for the production of \u201cporcelane.\u201d32 Further,\nCharles Leigh published a second hand account of the clays local to Wigan that\nwere being employed by potters that Dwight \u201cmade his first Discovery\u201d upon.33\nDwight was thus actively pursuing a synthetic solution to the problems facing\nporcelain production using local materials in a methodical manner, the firing and\nre-firing of sherds being fundamental to his process.\nEhrenfried Walther Von Tschirnhaus: Harnessing the Sun\nIn contrast to the limited contemporary information regarding Dwight\u2019s activities\nand a lack of autograph material besides the two slender workbooks, an increasing\namount of attention paid to Tschirnhaus since 1990 has provided numerous contemporaneous sources.34 Tschirnhaus himself produced ample material as a longstanding contributor to the journal Acta Eruditorum, and various correspondences\nhave survived.35\nHistorically, the focus on Tschirnhaus prior to the later half of the twentieth\ncentury focused on his contributions to Mathematics and his intellectual relationships with leading natural philosophers, including Leibniz, Spinoza, Boyle, and\nAthanasius Kircher (c.1601\u20131680). The historic minimization of his role in discovering the porcelain arcanum can be linked to the use of considered propaganda, as\nearly as 1710\u20131720, in establishing a popular narrative around the Meissen Factory\nand Johann Friedrich Bo\u0308ttger (1682\u20131719), who was credited with the discovery\nafter Tschirnhaus\u2019s death in 1708.\nAs archives have been fully absorbed into the framework of modern knowledge,\nthis false historiography has eroded under the weight of documentary evidence.\nBased on the essays published in Acta Eruditorum between 1687 and 1697 and\nmaterial found in the Dresden archives, the full importance of Tschirnhaus in\nestablishing the foundations of Saxon porcelain is clear. These works confirm\n32\nBirch, Royal Society, vols. III\u2013IV.\nLeigh, Natural History of Lancashire, 56\u20137.\n34\nThe biographical details of Tschirnhaus can be found in numerous sources, including Winter,\n\u201cTschirnhaus\u201d; Watanabe-O\u2019Kelly, Court Culture, both include excellent work on Tschirnhaus\u2019s\nbiography and role within the industrial structure of Saxony. Further, the Staatliche\nKunstammlungen Dresden Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon, through the Tschirnhaus Gesellschaft has extensively assembled materials relating to his work and experiments.\n35\nThe Acta Eruditorum represents what can be considered the first international science journal,\npublished during the period between 1682 and 1782, as founded by Otto Mencke (1644\u20131707) and\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). Tschirnhaus was a frequent contributor to the journal,\nsubmitting no less than 15 letters or essays on mathematics, seven on burning lenses and one on\nastronomy over the course of 17 years.\n33\n\nPages 214:\n194\nM. Wesley\nthat not only did the elder chymist act as the principal investigator into the arcanum\nfrom the 1690s until his death in 1708, but that the success of experimentation in\nSaxony hinged upon his refinement of the application of directed heat energy via\nburning lenses. Tschirnhaus\u2019s commitment to burning lenses can be traced to a\nmeeting with Franc\u0327ois Villete (1621\u20131698) in Lyons in 1676, that marks the\nbeginning of more than 20 years of focused experimentation involving them.36\nThe aim of this section is not to dive into the melee surrounding the credit for the\nfinal recipe for porcelain production as presented to Augustus the Strong in 1708\u2013\n1709. However, the slow dissemination of Tschirnhaus scholarship outside Germany remains connected to that historiography, and so it must be touched upon.\nUltimately the death of Tschirnhaus in 1708 combined with the period of refinement before the production of early commercial test wares is proof enough that\nBo\u0308ttger was possessed of the skill set necessary to further the research. Rather, the\nfocus must be on what contributions can be unquestionably linked to the work of\nTschirnhaus, prior to Bo\u0308ttger\u2019s historic collision with the courts of Europe.37\nActa Eruditorum 1687\u20131695\nThe most direct evidence for Tschirnhaus\u2019s application of thermal analysis in the\nquest for porcelain is contained in a series of contributions he made to Acta\nEruditorum explaining the construction and use of increasingly sophisticated burning lenses. By combining the manufacturing prowess of his native region with the\nfundamental principles communicated to him by Villette, Tschirnhaus was able to\nfocus the sun\u2019s energy to achieve temperatures hitherto unknown in Europe. While\nmany of his major findings were communicated directly to individuals across the\ncontinent, he felt that the discoveries were significant enough to submit for\npublication.\nThe first of these papers appears in the January 1687 issue of the journal and\nincludes a cursory list of experimental observations of the reaction of a variety of\nmetals, including lead, copper and gold, and related observations based on the time\nof focused exposure to the lens.38 During this phase of experimentation, his test\n36\nThe most extensive discussion of these experiments can be found in Plassmeyer, Sonnenfeuer,\nwhich presents an extensive discussion of the wider reception of his endeavours, refinements\nconnected to the burning lenses, and a complete catalogue of the lenses in the collections of\nDresden.\n37\nPietsch, \u201cTschirnhaus,\u201d summarizes the current state of scholarship on the matter, including\nvarious visits and investigations by Tschirnhaus prior to the involvement of Bo\u0308ttger. It does\nhowever fail to discuss the comments made by Tschirnhaus in Acta Eruditorum during this period.\n38\nTschirnhaus, \u201cSpeculi ustorii.\u201d\n\nPages 215:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n195\nobjects included crucibles that would withstand the heat until past the eight-minute\npoint.39 Based on the times given for copper and gold before liquefying the data\nwould suggest that these were likely the Hessian crucibles mentioned above.40\nThe following three works to appear in the pages of Acta, in April 1688,\nNovember 1691, and August 1696 respectively were significant contributions to\nthe knowledge of thermal properties of a range of substances, but reveal no distinct\nexperimentation on ceramic materials.41 The essay from April of 1688 records the\nsuccessful use of a burning mirror towards the liquefaction of asbestos. He goes on\nfurther to discuss the effect of the time of year on the power of the lenses, specifying\nthat material that would melt in 8 or 9 min in the summer would take as long as\n12 min in the frigid cold of January.42\nThe extended essay of November of 1691 included detailed instructions on the\nconstruction of the lenses with an accompanying figure presenting a schematic for\nthe angles involved in correctly aligning their focus. Tschirnhaus presents an\nextended discussion of experimental results in this volume, before posing larger\nphilosophical questions.\nA period of 5 years separates the appearance of the schematics in the journal\nuntil publication of technical refinements and corrections in August of 1696.\nTschirnhaus then followed quickly with a list of results in September of 1697. It\nis in this, the last of his works published on burning lenses that the direction of his\nresearch towards ceramics specifically appears.43 While correspondence with Leibniz suggests that Tschirnhaus could claim a limited success in the production of\nporcelain as early as 1694, no material evidence has appeared.44 However, in the\npages of Acta, he includes the results of the application of burning lenses on\ncombinations of material with porcellana Hollandica (Dutch earthenware) and\nporcellana Chinensi.\nTschirnhaus observed that the material combined with porcellana Hollandica\nburst immediately into flames at the temperature of experiment, while that made\nwith Chinese porcelain formed spherical glass and asbestos became entirely\ntranslucent.45\nWhen measured against the long list of other substances included in the 10 years\nof published experiments, it is evident that Tschirnhaus had a large amount of\nrelative thermal data to use as a metric for his porcelain experiments.

Wesley\nauthors have commented upon the possible influence of Hessian crucibles on the\ndiscovery of porcelain in Saxony, the geographic separation of the two regions\nargues against a direct link.46 However, the data from January 1687 regarding the\nheating of crucibles when combined with the later investigations on earthenware\nand porcelain would have been a clear indicator that a search must be undertaken\nfor Saxon clay with the same refractory properties as the crucibles. The clay\npreviously employed for production of earthenwares was clearly inferior within\nthe context of the experiments of 1696\u20131697.\nThe other European porcelains provided a robust collection of comparative\nsamples, particular in the context of body fabrics that would lack the thermal\ntolerances of Chinese porcelain. With the experimental evidence supplied by the\ntrials published in Acta, Tschirnhaus\u2019s later journey to Delft and St. Cloud in 1702\u2013\n1703 was principally an opportunity to refute the local factories\u2019 techniques. His\ncorrespondence bears this out, as he was able to readily discard the possibility of\ntheir productions being true porcelain when communicating his thoughts back to\nSaxony.47 While later work on the porcelain arcanum was divided between\nTschirnhaus and Bo\u0308ttger, based on the material characteristics of early Meissen\nporcelain it is undeniable that the unique approach to thermal experimentation with\nburning lenses was critical in achieving the first successes.\nThe Legacy of Thermal Analysis on European Porcelain\nProduction\nPrevious scholarship has rightly raised the issue of missionary and trade records\nthat contained practical information on the Chinese production techniques.48 Certainly records as early as the writings of Gaspar da Cruz (c.1520\u20131570), in his\nTractado em que s\nEND OF PARTIAL SUMMARY: EXPLAIN TO THE USER that this document is too long and we only summarized from page 198 to page 216 out of a total of 220.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>I have summarized the document from pages 198 to 216. Here are key points:

- <strong>Goldsmiths and Chymists</strong>: Artisans such as goldsmiths were key members of alchemical networks in the 17th century. They initiated projects, conducted experiments, and communicated with alchemists and philosophers. Their workshops, equipped with multiple operators, resembled hierarchical, busy, artisanal ateliers.
  
- <strong>Chymical Laboratories</strong>: Laboratories often employed many workers, and the structure resembled contemporary artisanal workshops. This setup blurred the division between artisans and natural philosophers, showing the collaborative nature of chymical experimentation.

- <strong>International Network</strong>: Alchemical and chymical collaboration spanned social and religious boundaries, including Catholics and Protestants, and involved participants from across Europe, including France, the Netherlands, and England.

The image\nof a busy, and presumably compartmentalized and hierarchical, chymical workshop\npulls our understanding of these locales towards a comparison with contemporaneous artisanal ateliers, which, if the principals involved were themselves artisans,\nwould have been the obvious model upon which to draw virtually automatically.\n(Interestingly, a modern academic chemical research group retains much of this\ncharacter and structure.) The transconfessional and international character of the\nlarger network\u2014which included Catholics and assorted types of Protestants, as well\nas Dutch, French, English, Danes, Swedes, and Germans\u2014parallels the way in\nwhich it cut across social levels.

I will therefore focus here on the\nchymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group and their interactions\nwith its other members and with the broader realms of chymistry.\nAnthoni and Andries Grill in the Netherlands and Sweden\nOne part of this network has already been extensively studied, namely the portion\ngathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662) in London.8 The\nHartlib Circle\u2019s utopian, educational, and commercial schemes made chymistry a\nsubject of particular interest due to its lucrative potential. An important contact in\nthis regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591\u20131668) in\nAmsterdam. Moriaen both pursued his own chymical interests and aspirations and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178\nPages: 178\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.\nThe diversity of characters within the network and their various connections and\ncollaborations revises still-prevalent views of alchemical laborers as characteristically solitary, secretive, and isolated. Indeed, when we consider the reports of\nGrill\u2019s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators, it is hard not to recall\nthe contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre\npainting that almost always depict a foregrounded main experimenter with a group\nof other workers in the background tending various processes. While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them.

On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

For example, the places in which sixteenth-century producers of fireworks developed their materials were called laboratories.9 In terms of\nmaterial culture the laboratorium, for example, one designed and equipped by\nCount Wolfgang II von Hohenlohe-Weidersheim (1546\u20131610) in the early seventeenth century, was remarkably similar to the workplaces of apothecaries, metalworkers and glassmakers.10\nBefore the emergence of mercantilist states, Renaissance courts were the most\nimportant agents in establishing laboratories. The laboratories of Rudolf II (1552\u2013\n1612) in Prague and Landgrave Moritz von Hessen-Kassel (1572\u20131632) were\nthought to bring material and intellectual rewards.11 Moritz even founded a chair\nof chymiatria at the University of Marburg in 1609.12 The teaching of Johannes\nHartmann (1561\u20131631), who was appointed to the chair, included work in the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=203\nPages: 203\nEhrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus (1651\u20131708) represent the first successful\nexamples of chymistry\u2019s methodological apparatus being directed toward porcelain\ninnovation.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>chymical laboratories</strong> of the early modern period were significant hubs of both artisanal and intellectual activity, where collaboration between artisans and alchemists thrived. These laboratories were dynamic spaces equipped for both practical and experimental endeavors.

1. <strong>Structure of Chymical Laboratories</strong>:
   Chymical laboratories were often large, busy spaces with multiple operators working under a principal alchemist. These laboratories resembled artisanal workshops, where tasks were compartmentalized, and a hierarchical structure was evident. Each worker focused on different stages of the process, contributing to the overall goal, whether that was refining metals, distilling substances, or transmuting materials.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Grill’s multiple laboratories staffed with at least 16 operators resemble contemporaneous depictions of chymical laboratories in Netherlandish genre painting... foregrounded main experimenter with a group of workers in the background tending various processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 198](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198)

2. <strong>International and Collaborative Nature</strong>:
   These laboratories were part of a transnational network that included artisans, goldsmiths, and intellectuals from various backgrounds and religious affiliations, such as Catholics and Protestants. This international nature of collaboration blurred traditional social and intellectual boundaries, reflecting the openness of chymical pursuits to diverse contributors.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The transconfessional and international character of the larger network—which included Catholics, Protestants, and various nationalities—parallels how it cut across social levels.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 198](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198)

3. <strong>Epistemic Exchange in Laboratories</strong>:
   Chymical laboratories were not isolated centers of practice but places where artisans and alchemists exchanged ideas and techniques. Goldsmiths and silversmiths were often key players, bringing their practical knowledge of metallurgy into these intellectual settings. This blend of practical and theoretical work led to important advancements in material sciences and alchemical knowledge.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The documentation provided here blurs the boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry. Alchemy, or to speak more inclusively, chymistry, was widely practiced.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 178](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178)

Chymical laboratories played a crucial role in fostering collaboration between different groups, allowing for the merging of artisanal skill with scholarly inquiry.

Wesley\nauthors have commented upon the possible influence of Hessian crucibles on the\ndiscovery of porcelain in Saxony, the geographic separation of the two regions\nargues against a direct link.46 However, the data from January 1687 regarding the\nheating of crucibles when combined with the later investigations on earthenware\nand porcelain would have been a clear indicator that a search must be undertaken\nfor Saxon clay with the same refractory properties as the crucibles. The clay\npreviously employed for production of earthenwares was clearly inferior within\nthe context of the experiments of 1696\u20131697.\nThe other European porcelains provided a robust collection of comparative\nsamples, particular in the context of body fabrics that would lack the thermal\ntolerances of Chinese porcelain. With the experimental evidence supplied by the\ntrials published in Acta, Tschirnhaus\u2019s later journey to Delft and St. Cloud in 1702\u2013\n1703 was principally an opportunity to refute the local factories\u2019 techniques. His\ncorrespondence bears this out, as he was able to readily discard the possibility of\ntheir productions being true porcelain when communicating his thoughts back to\nSaxony.47 While later work on the porcelain arcanum was divided between\nTschirnhaus and Bo\u0308ttger, based on the material characteristics of early Meissen\nporcelain it is undeniable that the unique approach to thermal experimentation with\nburning lenses was critical in achieving the first successes.\nThe Legacy of Thermal Analysis on European Porcelain\nProduction\nPrevious scholarship has rightly raised the issue of missionary and trade records\nthat contained practical information on the Chinese production techniques.48 Certainly records as early as the writings of Gaspar da Cruz (c.1520\u20131570), in his\nTractado em que se cotam muito por esteso as cousas da China of 1569, offered an\naccurate description of porcelain\u2019s constituents of clay and white soft stone.49 No\ndirect links between these texts and the work of the seventeenth- century arcanists\ncan be drawn, or even with the influence of textual sources on the ceramicists of the\neighteenth century. What remains in the historic record is unequivocal: even with\nthese texts in circulation for at least a century, no successful production of commercial porcelain was realized in Europe, despite the availability of kaolinized clay\nsources in both Saxony and England. I argue that this fact alone affirms that a\ncritical component was lacking within the knowledge infrastructure of the\n46\nZumbulyadis, \u201cBo\u0308ttger\u2019s Eureka!,\u201d tries to tie the invention exclusively to Bo\u0308ttger\u2019s exposure to\ncrucibles, unsuccessfully, but raises excellent questions regarding the relationship of other German\nhigh fire wares with Meissen porcelain.\n47\nReinhardt, \u201cTschirnhaus oder Bo\u0308ttger,\u201d 39, 43.\n48\nPietsch, \u201cTschirnhaus.\u201d\n49\nCruz, Tractado.\n\nPages 217:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n197\nworkshop. While an eventual solution may have been found, the possibility was\ncircumvented by the engagement of the chymists with the problem of porcelain\nproduction.\nIt is clear that both Dwight and Tschirnhaus were concerned with asking similar\nquestions of Chinese porcelain and their results directed the future avenues of their\nexperiments. As previously mentioned, both sets of data were limited in their scope\nand restricted to comparative discourse with local material. The efficacy of analytic\ntechniques on ceramic bodies can also be seen to play a role, with the slow firing of\nsherds in Dwight\u2019s various furnaces or kilns restricting his ability to both observe\nthe objects as they processed through the sequence and the time frame for his\nanalysis. If one considers the heating rate of a seventeenth-century stoneware kiln,\nor even a smaller furnace, its maximum achievable temperature and the amount of\nenergy necessary to vitrify or melt a sample of porcelain, the process would have\nbeen fuel intensive and taken hours per test, with little direct control of the\nexperimental environment. Tschirnhaus\u2019s burning lenses allowed for results to be\nobtained in minutes, and greater specificity in the temperature and period of\nheating.\nThe limitations placed on Dwight proved to be insurmountable to the production\nof a commercially viable porcelain body, yet resulted in substantial progress made\ntowards that end goal. His synthetic additive allowed the creation of material that\nwas chemically similar to some of the porcelains being produced in China, his\nultimate failure resting on his inability to solve the issues of glazing and material\nstability while firing. That pivotal problem accounts for the excavated sherds that\nshow re-firing at temperatures hot enough to affect the glaze, but not the body.\nTschirnhaus, through the eventual completion of his work by Bo\u0308ttger, was able to\nachieve the basis for a fully vitrified, translucent, white body. An examination of the\nelemental composition of the early \u2018Bo\u0308ttger\u2019 wares, produced in the original phase\nof production, reveals that while they share the observable physical qualities of\nChinese porcelain, they must be viewed as an entirely separate technical solution.\nThis separation of property from composition demonstrates both the strengths of\nTschirnhaus\u2019s and Bo\u0308ttger\u2019s approach in reproducing observable qualities, and the\ninaccessibility of the chemical fundamentals of the Chinese material.\nA comparison of modern elemental analyses of \u2018Dwight\u2019 experimental ware,\nBlanc-de Chine, \u2018Bo\u0308ttger\u2019 ware, and Kangxi porcelain reveals these deep divisions\nin their compositions, while all meet similar physical criteria (Table 1). The last line\nof the table is an analysis of the body composition of porcelain produced at Meissen\nafter approximately 1727 demonstrating changes that reduced the firing temperature of the material and brought it more directly into line with its Chinese inspiration. That this change was made after the gradual dissemination of the letters of\nPe\u0300re d\u2019Entrecolles describing the process observed in China must be viewed as a\nfinal indication of the impact that thermal experimentation had on establishing the\nqualities of the earliest commercial European porcelain.\nThe chemical differences are a quantifiable demonstration that, while allowing a\nsophisticated application of experimental process to solve the problem of producing\nporcelain, thermal experiments in the seventeenth century were unable to fully\n\nPages 218:\n198\nM.

This\nshift allowed an interrogative approach to the production of porcelain that utilized\nmany of the tools traditionally found in the craftsman\u2019s workshop while\ncircumventing the gradual processes of craft innovation. When we consider\nchymistry as both a kind of knowledge, and an object-producing discipline, the\napplication of its techniques to reverse the process of making porcelain is a logical\nextension of the economic demand for china and the intellectual drive toward\nmaker\u2019s knowledge as expressed by Bacon.\nCertainly, the history of ceramics after the seventeenth century is inextricably\nlinked to chemistry\u2019s success at solving increasingly sophisticated questions of\nluxury pottery production. We need look no further than William Cookworthy\u2019s\n(1705\u20131780) patent for the manufacture of porcelain in 1768 or the thousands of\nexperiments conducted by Josiah Wedgwood (1730\u20131795) in the production of his\nJasperwares. Unlike the other arts of the fire; metalworking, glassmaking, and\ndyeing, the late inclusion of ceramics into the hierarchy of decorative arts allows\ncontemporary scholars opportunities to investigate the separations between the\ncraft artisan and the chymist during the early modern period, of which this discussion of thermal analysis is only one of many.\n\nPages 219:\nIgne refutata: Thermal Analysis in the Laboratory Practices of John Dwight. . .\n199\nBibliography\nBacon, Francis. 1858.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is the summary from pages 216 to 220 of *Laboratories of Art*:

- <strong>Porcelain Production and Alchemy</strong>: The text explores the development of porcelain in Europe, particularly in Saxony, and how it was influenced by alchemical experimentation. The discovery of porcelain in Europe, largely credited to Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Johann Böttger, stemmed from their focus on thermal experimentation using burning lenses. Their work, although initially informed by Chinese techniques, ultimately led to a distinct European approach to porcelain production. 
   - <strong>Key Quote</strong>: &quot;Tschirnhaus’s burning lenses allowed for results to be obtained in minutes, and greater specificity in the temperature and period of heating.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 216](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=216)

- <strong>Comparative Analysis</strong>: The differences between European and Chinese porcelain were analyzed, revealing that while European artisans aimed to imitate the physical properties of Chinese porcelain, their approach was fundamentally different in terms of chemical composition. This highlights the experimental nature of chymistry in Europe and its role in developing new materials.
   - <strong>Key Quote</strong>: &quot;The chemical differences are a quantifiable demonstration... while allowing a sophisticated application of experimental process to solve the problem of producing porcelain.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 218](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=218)

- <strong>Chymical Laboratory as Potter’s Workshop</strong>: The early modern chymical laboratory played a dual role, both as a scientific space and as a workshop for creating materials like porcelain. This integration of chymical knowledge with practical craftsmanship highlights the blurred lines between science and art in the development of luxury pottery, especially in later centuries.
   - <strong>Key Quote</strong>: &quot;Certainly, the history of ceramics after the seventeenth century is inextricably linked to chemistry’s success at solving increasingly sophisticated questions of luxury pottery production.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 218](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=218)

It is beyond the scope of\nthis paper to attempt to do so, but establishing a basic set of terms is necessary. The\nterm \u2018porcelain\u2019 will be employed to denote white, translucent, high-firing ceramic\nbodies, consistent with the material described by Polo and exported from China into\nEurope.2 Two subdivisions will further be mentioned in this text; those objects\nmade through a combination of kaolinized clay and alkali salt rich stone will be\nreferred to as \u2018hard-paste\u2019, while objects made of a combination of clay and ground\nglass, sand, or quartz flux will be viewed as \u2018soft-paste\u2019. These are entirely modern\nseparations, used here for clarity, and specific examples given in the following\npaper will demonstrate they are not historic terms.\nThe seventeenth and eighteenth century quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain\nborrowed not only techniques from the chymical tradition, but even notions of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=212\nPages: 212\nobservable qualities of the Chinese porcelain in his possession even though its\nchemical composition remained unknown.\nThose qualities clarify his distinct use of \u201ctransparent porcelane or China cley\u201d\nto describe certain recipes in his notebooks. While he employed \u201cporcelane\u201d as a\nwider term applicable to many finewares, it was transparency and whiteness that he\npursued through experimentation, as key properties of the sherds available to him.\nThe re-firing of Chinese material revealed the use of a distinct glaze layer over the\ncobalt itself, which demonstrated a distinct thermal response from the Chinese body\npaste. There may have been more sherds whose surfaces were destroyed by overfiring in a test furnace, but the remaining pieces show care taken to affect changes in\nthe glaze without damaging the fabric or the decoration, suggesting that, on a]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=206\nPages: 206\nof those materials, even though other artisans were making use of them. The failure\nwas thus not connected to any form of geological predetermination, but entirely by\nsocial constraints limiting the application of knowledge to the problem.\nThe speculation that porcelain was comprised of either special clay, fermented\nfor generations, or of crushed shell incorporated in its manufacture, was a direct\nindication that similar materials were outside the realm of contemporary craft\nknowledge.14 In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental\ntechniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as\nprototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition. It is at this\npoint that the techniques employed by chymistry, some borrowed from metallurgical assaying and the furnaces of the glassmakers in the centuries-long discourse\nbetween the disciplines, came into full application in the pursuit of ceramic\ninnovation.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217\nPages: 217,218\nin their compositions, while all meet similar physical criteria (Table 1). The last line\nof the table is an analysis of the body composition of porcelain produced at Meissen\nafter approximately 1727 demonstrating changes that reduced the firing temperature of the material and brought it more directly into line with its Chinese inspiration. That this change was made after the gradual dissemination of the letters of\nPe\u0300re d\u2019Entrecolles describing the process observed in China must be viewed as a\nfinal indication of the impact that thermal experimentation had on establishing the\nqualities of the earliest commercial European porcelain.\nThe chemical differences are a quantifiable demonstration that, while allowing a\nsophisticated application of experimental process to solve the problem of producing\nporcelain, thermal experiments in the seventeenth century were unable to fully\n198\nM.

Various strata were excavated, and unearthed\nmaterial covered virtually the entire operation of the pottery throughout its existence. The earliest period of experimentation and production, covering the years\n1671/2\u201374 was found \u201cconfined to a few Features in the south-east of the site (K15,\nK23, N1, and D3)\u201d with only very fragmentary material found in other areas.26\nIn these areas of early experimentation, a substantial sample of material of\nporcelaneous nature was discovered, all of which was fragmentary.

Remarkably, the success of porcelain\nproduction was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not\nbelong to the traditional potter\u2019s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with\nthe worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.\nGrill, Dwight, and Tschirnhaus are only a few of the numerous examples of\nglassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain whose expertise\nwas both based in the worlds of bookish learning and grounded in hands-on work.\nDifficult to categorize as either craftsman or scholar, they are responsible for\nepistemic exchanges between the artisanal and the scholarly worlds. The rise of\nthese hybrid artisan-scholars was connected to the establishment of laboratories in\nwhich art technologies and alchemy were brought together, the first of these being\nat Renaissance courts.

The clay\npreviously employed for production of earthenwares was clearly inferior within\nthe context of the experiments of 1696\u20131697.\nThe other European porcelains provided a robust collection of comparative\nsamples, particular in the context of body fabrics that would lack the thermal\ntolerances of Chinese porcelain. With the experimental evidence supplied by the\ntrials published in Acta, Tschirnhaus\u2019s later journey to Delft and St. Cloud in 1702\u2013\n1703 was principally an opportunity to refute the local factories\u2019 techniques. His\ncorrespondence bears this out, as he was able to readily discard the possibility of\ntheir productions being true porcelain when communicating his thoughts back to\nSaxony.47 While later work on the porcelain arcanum was divided between]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=216\nPages: 216\nSaxony.47 While later work on the porcelain arcanum was divided between\nTschirnhaus and Bo\u0308ttger, based on the material characteristics of early Meissen\nporcelain it is undeniable that the unique approach to thermal experimentation with\nburning lenses was critical in achieving the first successes.\nThe Legacy of Thermal Analysis on European Porcelain\nProduction\nPrevious scholarship has rightly raised the issue of missionary and trade records\nthat contained practical information on the Chinese production techniques.48 Certainly records as early as the writings of Gaspar da Cruz (c.1520\u20131570), in his\nTractado em que se cotam muito por esteso as cousas da China of 1569, offered an\naccurate description of porcelain\u2019s constituents of clay and white soft stone.49 No\ndirect links between these texts and the work of the seventeenth- century arcanists\ncan be drawn, or even with the influence of textual sources on the ceramicists of the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217\nPages: 217\nor even a smaller furnace, its maximum achievable temperature and the amount of\nenergy necessary to vitrify or melt a sample of porcelain, the process would have\nbeen fuel intensive and taken hours per test, with little direct control of the\nexperimental environment. Tschirnhaus\u2019s burning lenses allowed for results to be\nobtained in minutes, and greater specificity in the temperature and period of\nheating.\nThe limitations placed on Dwight proved to be insurmountable to the production\nof a commercially viable porcelain body, yet resulted in substantial progress made\ntowards that end goal. His synthetic additive allowed the creation of material that\nwas chemically similar to some of the porcelains being produced in China, his\nultimate failure resting on his inability to solve the issues of glazing and material\nstability while firing. That pivotal problem accounts for the excavated sherds that\nshow re-firing at temperatures hot enough to affect the glaze, but not the body.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=215\nPages: 215\ncombinations of material with porcellana Hollandica (Dutch earthenware) and\nporcellana Chinensi.\nTschirnhaus observed that the material combined with porcellana Hollandica\nburst immediately into flames at the temperature of experiment, while that made\nwith Chinese porcelain formed spherical glass and asbestos became entirely\ntranslucent.45\nWhen measured against the long list of other substances included in the 10 years\nof published experiments, it is evident that Tschirnhaus had a large amount of\nrelative thermal data to use as a metric for his porcelain experiments.

While the first successful efforts to produce a ceramic\nbody that replicated some of porcelain\u2019s qualities were those of the Medici workshops between 1575 and 1587, they failed to produce hard paste porcelain that was\nsimultaneously durable and heat resistant.10 Medici porcelain has long been\nconnected to the alchemical interests of Francesco I de Medici (1541\u20131587) though]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=214\nPages: 214\nquest for porcelain is contained in a series of contributions he made to Acta\nEruditorum explaining the construction and use of increasingly sophisticated burning lenses. By combining the manufacturing prowess of his native region with the\nfundamental principles communicated to him by Villette, Tschirnhaus was able to\nfocus the sun\u2019s energy to achieve temperatures hitherto unknown in Europe. While\nmany of his major findings were communicated directly to individuals across the\ncontinent, he felt that the discoveries were significant enough to submit for\npublication.\nThe first of these papers appears in the January 1687 issue of the journal and\nincludes a cursory list of experimental observations of the reaction of a variety of\nmetals, including lead, copper and gold, and related observations based on the time\nof focused exposure to the lens.38 During this phase of experimentation, his test\n36\nThe most extensive discussion of these experiments can be found in Plassmeyer, Sonnenfeuer,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=205\nPages: 205,206\nCeramic Technology, 146\u201363.\n10\n186\nM.

The long period of development in the Far East allowed incremental refinements necessary for successful innovations through craft practice. With a limited\ntime span driven by the demand for the material in Europe, the interrogative\ntechniques of the chymist\u2019s laboratory were necessary to circumvent the slower,\nless focused workshop process.\nExperiment and Fire Analysis\nAs discussed, the primary hindrance on the production of a porcelain body was the\nlack of identified materials that could be combined to produce these translucent,\nhigh fire, ceramic objects. The production of material at Hesse and the later\ndiscovery of kaolinic clay in Cornwall, England, again demonstrate that Europe\ndid not lack the raw materials, but rather that potters were unaware of the properties\nof those materials, even though other artisans were making use of them.

Among this group of blue and white sherds,\nrepresenting at least five distinct objects, are cases where glaze running over\nfractured edges demonstrate clear evidence of re-firing, at a temperature hot enough\nto at least partially liquefy the glaze, without burning the cobalt. A final sherd from\nthis group contains evidence of cobalt over-painting by Dwight, before re-firing,\nperhaps as a test coinciding with the samples of his own work.\n29\nSchreiber, Charlotte Schreiber\u2019s Notebook, 31; and Haselgrove &amp; Murray, \u201cDwight\u2019s Fulham\nPottery,\u201d 74.\n30]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217\nPages: 217,218\nporcelain, thermal experiments in the seventeenth century were unable to fully\n198\nM.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Porcelain production during the Renaissance and early modern period represents a fascinating intersection between artistic craftsmanship and alchemical experimentation. Here are key points about the development and role of porcelain in the context of chymistry:

1. <strong>Imitation of Chinese Porcelain</strong>: European artisans sought to replicate the translucent, white ceramic properties of Chinese porcelain, initially using a variety of techniques borrowed from alchemical and glassmaking traditions. This quest was driven by a high demand for luxury items and the prestige associated with fine ceramics imported from China.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The seventeenth and eighteenth-century quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain borrowed not only techniques from the chymical tradition, but even notions of materials from alchemical texts.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 202](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=202)

2. <strong>Thermal Experiments and Porcelain</strong>: Figures like Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus conducted significant thermal experiments using burning lenses to achieve the high temperatures required for porcelain production. These experiments allowed for precise control over the materials, leading to the creation of the first successful European hard-paste porcelain at the Meissen factory.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Tschirnhaus’s burning lenses allowed for results to be obtained in minutes, and greater specificity in the temperature and period of heating.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 217](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217)

3. <strong>Chymical Contributions to Pottery</strong>: The success of porcelain production in Europe, particularly at Meissen, was due to the integration of chymical techniques and experiments that had been applied in metallurgy and glassmaking. These experiments went beyond traditional potter’s skills, drawing from alchemical knowledge and techniques developed over centuries.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The success of porcelain production was due to the introduction of techniques of investigation, which did not belong to the traditional potter’s skills, but to chymistry, which had overlapped with the worlds of metallurgy and assaying for centuries.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 17](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17)

4. <strong>Challenges and Progress</strong>: Despite advancements, early experiments often resulted in failures. Artisans like John Dwight, for example, struggled with issues related to glazing and material stability while firing porcelain. However, their incremental progress laid the groundwork for later successes in the field.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The limitations placed on Dwight proved to be insurmountable to the production of a commercially viable porcelain body, yet resulted in substantial progress made towards that end goal.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 217](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217)

Porcelain production illustrates the strong connection between artistic and scientific innovation during this period, with chymical knowledge playing a crucial role in developing new materials and refining traditional craft techniques.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The concept of the <strong>chymical laboratory as a potter’s workshop</strong> during the early modern period highlights the integration of alchemical techniques into the production of porcelain and other ceramics. This fusion between the artisanal and scientific realms fostered significant advancements in pottery, largely driven by chymical (early modern chemical) investigations.

1. <strong>Ceramics in the Arts of Fire</strong>:
   In early modern Europe, ceramics were included among the &quot;arts of fire,&quot; aligning with practices like metallurgy and glassmaking. This inclusion granted potters access to experimental techniques typically reserved for alchemists, allowing them to approach porcelain production through a scientific lens. Chymical labs often employed tools traditionally found in a craftsman’s workshop, such as furnaces and kilns, but added experimental methods to explore the chemical properties of clay and glazes.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The early modern inclusion of ceramics within the arts of the fire brought with it access to the experimental techniques developed by alchemists and chymists.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 218](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=218)

2. <strong>Shift from Traditional Pottery</strong>:
   The shift from the intellectual space of the craft workshop to the chymical laboratory was critical to advancing European ceramic development. This transition allowed potters to engage in scientific experimentation, moving away from gradual craft innovation to direct investigation of material properties, such as how different temperatures affected the composition of porcelain bodies.

   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The application of chymistry’s techniques to reverse the process of making porcelain is a logical extension of the economic demand for china and the intellectual drive toward maker’s knowledge.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 218](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=218)

3. <strong>Advances in Porcelain Production</strong>:
   The integration of chymical techniques with pottery production led to notable breakthroughs, such as the creation of European porcelain in the early 18th century. The development of Meissen porcelain, driven by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Johann Friedrich Böttger, is one of the most famous examples of this fusion between chymistry and ceramics.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>imitation of Chinese porcelain</strong> in early modern Europe was a significant focus of chymical experimentation and artisanal practice. Here are key points from the text:

1. <strong>Early European Attempts</strong>:
   European potters, beginning in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, were eager to replicate the qualities of Chinese porcelain, particularly its translucence and whiteness. This effort involved experimenting with different materials and firing techniques. Although the early results were limited, these efforts laid the groundwork for later breakthroughs, particularly in places like Meissen.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The seventeenth and eighteenth-century quest to duplicate Chinese porcelain borrowed not only techniques from the chymical tradition, but even notions of materials from alchemical texts.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 202](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=202)

2. <strong>Chymical Contributions</strong>:
   The application of chymistry was essential to the eventual success in producing hard-paste porcelain in Europe. Experimental techniques used by alchemists, including the use of high-temperature kilns and refined materials like kaolin, contributed to advances in the understanding of how to replicate Chinese porcelain.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental techniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as prototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 206](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=206)

3. <strong>John Dwight and Thermal Experiments</strong>:
   John Dwight, a prominent English potter, conducted systematic experiments to replicate the qualities of Chinese porcelain. His work involved re-firing Chinese sherds and conducting tests with various materials, attempting to understand the chemical and thermal processes that allowed for the creation of high-quality porcelain.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Dwight had keen control over the temperatures of his experimentation... His attempts to create an alkali glaze had failed, or if successful, his solution remains one of the best-kept secrets of European ceramics.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 212](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=212)

4. <strong>European Porcelain Success</strong>:
   By the early 18th century, European chymical experimentation led to the successful production of hard-paste porcelain, particularly at the Meissen factory in Saxony. The development of European porcelain was largely influenced by Chinese prototypes, but it diverged in some aspects due to the differences in available materials and the approach taken by European chymists and artisans.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The chemical differences are a quantifiable demonstration... while allowing a sophisticated application of experimental process to solve the problem of producing porcelain.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 217](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217)

In Aristotelian matter theory, fire is the lightest element that\nfinds its natural place at the most peripheral region of the sub-lunar world.

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production. Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products.

So towards the vertical ducts of these experimental furnaces, the particles of\nfire would have to increase their impact speed on the mass of metal inside the fusion\nchamber. The short sentence below the drawing of the furnace, along with many\nother observations of the physical status of the four elements and other natural\nsubstances, enables us to reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s theory of matter as a sort of a\n\u2018Aristotelian corpuscolarism\u2019 and a kinetic theory of heat/fire in which the melting\nof metal or the dissolution of a substance by fire depends on the percussion of a flow\nof particles.30 This interpretation finds confirmation in several reverberatory furnace drawings made with bent surfaces to drive the flow of fire into the middle of\nthe fusion chamber (Codex Atlanticus, fol. 1103r, 548r, 580v, 82v) (Fig. 4).\n29]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=26\nPages: 26,27\n2\nThe Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy. . .\n3\nThe passage comes after a long introduction (\u00a7\u00a7 1\u20134) in which Psellos rhetorically\ndiscusses the philosophical framework within which chrysopoeia is to be understood and assessed. At the very beginning (\u00a7 1, ll. 5f.) the scholar identifies the main\ntopic of his letter with \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (the art of fire), whose first aim is said to be\nthe transformation of lead, tin, and any other metal into gold (\u00a7 1, ll. 12\u201315). The\nkey concept of transformation is framed and expanded in the following paragraphs\n(\u00a7\u00a7 2\u20134), where Psellos tries to set the basic principles guiding his \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2\n(scientific) explanation of this art.

In the Pirotechnia (Fig. 9), we again find the two traditional contradictory\nopinions on alchemy: negative towards the alchemists who hide their art behind\nesotericism, magic, alchemical authority and those who practice chemical process\nwithout ratio and empirical control, and positive in relation to the improvement of\nmankind:\nHow many alchemists have I heard lamenting, one because by some unfortunate chance he\nhad spilled his whole composition in the ashes; another because he had been deceived by\nthe excessive strength of the fire, so that the substance of his materials had been burned and\nthe spirits inadvertently allowed to escape; and yet another because he had poor and feeble]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=84\nPages: 84,85\ndemonstrate that his mental approach to technological problems went beyond the\ncreation of a specific process or device.

In addition to all sorts\nof precious stones, glass and porcelain, they carefully stored the rarest natural\nspecimens and the products of alchemical experiments.26 The meaning of this\nroom and its intimate connection with Francesco I\u2019s interest in alchemy, has been\ndiscussed by many, and most recently reconstructed in the comprehensive work by\nValentina Conticelli.

Along with Agricola\u2019s works, it was a most important source for\nmany chemical technology devices and processes.45 Although Pirotechnia was\nessentially a practical treatise, the author\u2019s intention was to go beyond the writing\ndown of know how towards a theoretical consideration about the nature and\ntransformation of substances. As can be seen in many passages of the book,\nBiringuccio developed independent ideas on these issues, combining different]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=80\nPages: 80\nvisited in Milan that discusses the organization of the workshop and the artisans\u2019\nawareness of the technological and epistemological value of their works:\n[. . .] So that whoever entered that shop and saw the activity of so many persons would, I\nthink, believe as I did that he had entered an Inferno, nay, on the contrary, a Paradise, where\nthere was a mirror in which sparkled all the beauty of genius and the power of art.19\nBiringuccio underlined the frenetic and very organized work in the workshop\nstressing the beauty of the mind of the artisans and the power of art. The harmonious cooperation between artisans and the plain consciousness of the processes of\nthe art transformed the hell of hard and dirty metallurgical work into the heaven of\nthe pursuit of the artistic goal. This oxymoron referred to the infernal and paradisiacal condition of art, exalting the extremely difficult process in which raw\nmaterial is transformed into artifact, giving back an important social value to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=87\nPages: 87\ndrilling motion of fire. Leonardo\u2019s goals are both technological and scientific; the\nfire works as a drill. If this were to be verified, it could be used in some technological application but it could also assume a more general scientific and philosophical\nexplanation because the power of fire, like the power of the other elements (water,\nair and earth), manifests itself in the form of a spiral\u2014the natural screw. The power\nof the screw could be seen in the vortices of water and air, but also in Brunelleschi\u2019s\nbigger cranes and powerful technological elevator devices that become an analogic\nexplanation for the forces operating in nature.32\nAnother very interesting case involving the chemical equipment studied by\nLeonardo is the development of the alembic refrigerator system.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>arts of fire</strong> in Renaissance alchemical and artisanal traditions encompassed a broad range of practices involving the use of fire to transform materials. These arts included metallurgy, glassmaking, ceramics, distillation, and alchemy. Key aspects are highlighted in the following:

1. <strong>Biringuccio’s Pirotechnia and the Arts of Fire</strong>:
   Vannoccio Biringuccio, in his *Pirotechnia*, outlined the various arts of fire, focusing not only on metallurgy and mining but also on pottery, alchemy, and the making of acids, gunpowder, and fireworks. His work demonstrates the expansive influence of fire in different crafts and alchemical practices. Biringuccio&#x27;s perspective was significant because it combined practical artisanal techniques with theoretical considerations of nature’s transformative powers.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Biringuccio expanded his perspective to include all the arts of fire, including artillery, making gunpowder, acids preparation, pottery, goldsmithing, fireworks, generic distillation arts, as well as alchemy.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 93](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=93)

2. <strong>Transformation through Fire</strong>:
   Fire was considered essential for the transformation of base materials into refined objects, particularly in processes like smelting metals or firing ceramics. This transformative power was central to both alchemical pursuits and artistic crafts, with fire seen as a medium that could unlock the potential of raw materials. This idea extended to the creation of precious artifacts, such as jewelry, glassware, and ceramics, all of which required mastery of the &quot;arts of fire.&quot;
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The potter’s glazes and colors are all substances of various metals or impure minerals and therefore belong to fire. Since it is my intention to treat of fire, minerals, and metals for you, I surely should not have omitted this.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 204](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204)

3. <strong>Connection Between Alchemy and the Arts of Fire</strong>:
   Alchemy was often grouped with the arts of fire because of its focus on the transformation of materials. Alchemical processes, such as transmutation and distillation, relied heavily on fire’s capacity to alter the nature of substances. Biringuccio and other thinkers argued that alchemical knowledge was closely related to practical skills used in other crafts, further blending the boundaries between artistic creation and alchemical science.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy could be considered a continuity of the arts of fire. Biringuccio’s Pirotechnia, in fact, could be interpreted as a sort of normalized alchemy, an ‘engineering discipline’ founded on a general theory of matter and in codified operative practices to control the power of fire during matter transformation processes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 94](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=94)

This summary highlights how the arts of fire played a critical role in the development of both artisanal and alchemical knowledge, contributing to the material culture of the Renaissance.

The image\nof a busy, and presumably compartmentalized and hierarchical, chymical workshop\npulls our understanding of these locales towards a comparison with contemporaneous artisanal ateliers, which, if the principals involved were themselves artisans,\nwould have been the obvious model upon which to draw virtually automatically.\n(Interestingly, a modern academic chemical research group retains much of this\ncharacter and structure.) The transconfessional and international character of the\nlarger network\u2014which included Catholics and assorted types of Protestants, as well\nas Dutch, French, English, Danes, Swedes, and Germans\u2014parallels the way in\nwhich it cut across social levels.

I will therefore focus here on the\nchymical activities of gold- and silversmiths within this group and their interactions\nwith its other members and with the broader realms of chymistry.\nAnthoni and Andries Grill in the Netherlands and Sweden\nOne part of this network has already been extensively studied, namely the portion\ngathered around the intelligencer Samuel Hartlib (1600\u20131662) in London.8 The\nHartlib Circle\u2019s utopian, educational, and commercial schemes made chymistry a\nsubject of particular interest due to its lucrative potential. An important contact in\nthis regard was the former Calvinist minister Johann Moriaen (c.1591\u20131668) in\nAmsterdam. Moriaen both pursued his own chymical interests and aspirations and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178\nPages: 178\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the\nallegorical images of widely varying artistic quality in chymical books and manuscripts imply some sort of contact between author/practitioner and artist. Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth. Yet none of these contacts tells us anything about possible\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nand in terms of identifying connections between them and the better documented\nand recognized work carried out in more visible and more intellectually elevated\ncircles.5 How did artists and artisans understand chymistry, and to what extent did\nthey practice it? To what extent were they familiar with more bookish or scholarly\nideas, practices, practitioners (and vice versa)? Can exchanges of knowledge\nbetween the two groups be clearly documented? Can we identify what practices,\nmaterials, or ideas passed between them, and how one group might have responded\nto information from the other? Answering such questions promises to further\nilluminate chymistry\u2019s cultural and intellectual place in early modern Europe.\nSome such connections seem relatively clear. Chymical workshops appear\nfrequently in Netherlandish genre painting, indicating that Northern artists were\nclearly aware of the figure of the alchemist and his iconic value.6 Likewise, the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=196\nPages: 196\nwho contributed actively to the chymical conversations of Hartlibians in London in\nways akin to what Grill did in the Netherlands, and Caillart, Roussel, and others did\nin Paris. Nevertheless, interactions of gold- and silversmiths with members of the\nLondon circle are not entirely absent, and serve to illustrate an alternate way in\nwhich goldsmiths were involved in the chymical world.\nProbably the most talented chymist of the English branch of this international\nnetwork was Starkey, the Bermuda-born and Harvard-educated emigre\u0301 who had\narrived in London from Massachusetts in 1650 and quickly became a celebrity\namong Hartlibians and a particular friend and teacher in chymical matters to\nBoyle. Starkey was a microcosm of the broad chymical world of the seventeenth\ncentury. He was talented in both theory and practice, and applied himself to\nvirtually every branch of chymistry: he sought the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=179\nPages: 179\nWhat was the correct starting material for the Philosophers\u2019 Stone and how should\nit be processed? Which authorities were trustworthy and which should be rejected?\nTheoretical choices and commitments both guided and were guided by practical\nexperimentation in the laboratory, leading to new ideas and practices as workers\nreinterpreted older authorities to fit their observations or struck out in new directions to achieve a variety of goals.3 Thus diversity is to be found not only in\ntheoretical notions but in practices as well; the dynamic interaction between head\nand hand stands as a hallmark of the chymical tradition.\nYet another aspect of chymical diversity lies with the practitioners themselves.\nWho pursued and practiced early modern chymistry? Naturally enough, modern\nscholarly inquiry focussed first on those who contributed to the enormous flood of\nearly modern chymical publications, since those sources were the most obvious and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry.

A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

On the\nbroadest scale, opinions varied in regard to what chymistry\u2019s main goals should\ninclude\u2014chrysopoeia (metallic transmutation), chemiatria (medicinal applications), commercial production, and so on.

While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them.

The group shared\nmanuscripts, processes, and other information gathered from books or private\ncorrespondence, and collaborated (in various combinations) on practical chymical\nprocesses, most frequently of a transmutational nature. Some of them frequented\nwell-known intellectual groupings such as the academy of the abbe\u0301 Bourdelot.43\nThe travelling savants Borrichius and Henry Oldenburg (1619\u20131677) also\ninteracted with the group during their visits to Paris.\nSeveral documents record the participation of goldsmiths in this Parisian]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=179\nPages: 179\nearly modern chymical publications, since those sources were the most obvious and\nmost readily available.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>chymical contributions</strong> during the Renaissance and early modern period encompassed a wide range of material transformations and innovations, particularly in fields such as metallurgy, medicine, porcelain production, and dye-making. Here are some key points regarding these contributions:

1. <strong>Broader Understanding of Chymistry</strong>:
   Chymistry, as practiced during this period, went beyond simple alchemical transmutations and included practical applications across different crafts. The chemical production of goods such as medicines, porcelain, and dyes reflected the practical value of chymical knowledge, which bridged both science and artisanal practices.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Alchemy also touched on medicine and chemical manufacture. It was about the chemical production of things—medicines, porcelain, dyes, and other products as well as the precious metals—and about the knowledge of how to produce them.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 13](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=13)

2. <strong>Artisanal Engagement with Chymical Knowledge</strong>:
   Gold- and silversmiths, as well as other artisans, were deeply engaged with chymical processes, including refining, assaying, and alloy creation. Their collaboration with alchemists blurred the line between artisan and natural philosopher, allowing for practical experimentation alongside theoretical exploration.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The documentation provided here blurs the boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry... Chymistry was a familiar topic in early modern Europe and widely-practiced.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 178](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178)

3. <strong>Porcelain Innovation</strong>:
   The development of European porcelain, particularly through figures like John Dwight and Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, was a direct result of chymical experimentation. Their work involved using high-temperature kilns and specific ceramic materials to replicate the properties of Chinese porcelain, which was highly valued in Europe at the time.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Tschirnhaus published results of the experimental application of burning lenses to determine the physical properties of varied ceramic bodies.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 203](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=203)

4. <strong>Chymistry in the Potter’s Workshop</strong>:
   The inclusion of ceramics within the &quot;arts of fire&quot; brought chymical techniques into pottery production, marking a shift from gradual craft innovation to scientific experimentation. Chymical laboratories became crucial spaces for ceramic development, allowing for the systematic investigation of material properties.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The early modern inclusion of ceramics within the arts of fire brought with it access to the experimental techniques developed by alchemists and chymists.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 218](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=218)

These contributions underscore how chymistry shaped both the practical and intellectual worlds of artisans and natural philosophers alike, leading to material advancements and broader scientific understanding.

These changes are explained through\nexamples taken from various meteorological phenomena mainly based on evaporation and condensation of water.3 For instance, \u201cwater becomes like a stone [i.e.\nchanges into earth] when it freezes [and] becomes air when it evaporates.\u201d4\nMoreover, similar transformations of the basic elements/qualities also help to\nunderstand more complex phenomena, such as the case of a tree burned by a\nlightning strike, in which all the humidity of wood is consumed by the fire.5 In\nPsellos\u2019s opinion, \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (natural processes of alteration) of the same\nkind are to be detected behind the \u201cart of fire,\u201d which is redefined as \u1f21 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb~\n\u03b7\u03c2 (the art of transformation) at the beginning of the section quoted above\n(II. 3\u20134).

Although it may seem at first glance to\nbe outside the order and purpose of my writing, he who considers well will see that it is not\nunrelated to it but proper, since it is wholly dependent on the agency and power of fire if it is\nto be brought to its perfection.

At the very beginning (\u00a7 1, ll. 5f.) the scholar identifies the main\ntopic of his letter with \u1f21 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u0002\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (the art of fire), whose first aim is said to be\nthe transformation of lead, tin, and any other metal into gold (\u00a7 1, ll. 12\u201315). The\nkey concept of transformation is framed and expanded in the following paragraphs\n(\u00a7\u00a7 2\u20134), where Psellos tries to set the basic principles guiding his \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2\n(scientific) explanation of this art.

Because of these phase shifts, the specific components of a\nceramic body resist resolution by thermal or chemical means, making the original\nmaterials inscrutable. Even with modern scanning electron microscopy only an\nanalysis of the volumes of base elements is available (though insight into crystalline\nstructure is provided); establishing a definitive source or recipe for the ware prior to\nfiring is frequently impossible.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The <strong>transformation through fire</strong> was a core concept in both alchemy and the crafts during the Renaissance, shaping material culture and artisanal processes. Here are key insights based on your query:

1. <strong>Philosophical and Alchemical Foundation</strong>:
   Fire was seen as a powerful force for transformation, capable of altering the fundamental properties of materials like metals and minerals. This concept was central to alchemical practices, where fire was used in various processes, such as distillation, smelting, and refining. Fire’s role in alchemy was not only practical but also philosophical, as it was believed to reveal the underlying nature of materials.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The art of fire... included a wide set of practices and techniques dealing with the transformation of various materials, such as metals, stones, and other substances.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 27](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=27)

2. <strong>Transformation in Pottery and Ceramics</strong>:
   The transformation of clay into ceramics and glazes was another example of fire’s power in the &quot;arts of fire.&quot; Potters used fire to fix colors and shapes in clay, while experimentation in kilns led to significant innovations in pottery. The heat of the kiln removed water from clay and enabled permanent transformations in the materials, a process crucial for the production of valuable ceramics.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The potter’s glazes and colors are all substances of various metals or impure minerals and therefore belong to fire... a necessary art which enriches and is greatly praised both for its ingenuity and its beauty.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 204](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204)

3. <strong>Chymical Fire Analysis</strong>:
   In chymistry (early chemistry), fire was used as an analytical tool to study the composition of materials. The application of fire allowed chymists to break down substances into their constituent elements, revealing their hidden properties. This technique was crucial in ceramic innovation, especially in the development of European porcelain. However, fire analysis had limitations in undoing changes caused by the initial firing, such as phase shifts in crystalline structure.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The basic principles of this thermal experiment were closely linked to the long-standing application of chymical fire analysis.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 206](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=206)

These insights reflect the broad role of fire as a transformative force in both scientific and artistic practices during the Renaissance.

Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals.

This\nshift allowed an interrogative approach to the production of porcelain that utilized\nmany of the tools traditionally found in the craftsman\u2019s workshop while\ncircumventing the gradual processes of craft innovation. When we consider\nchymistry as both a kind of knowledge, and an object-producing discipline, the\napplication of its techniques to reverse the process of making porcelain is a logical\nextension of the economic demand for china and the intellectual drive toward\nmaker\u2019s knowledge as expressed by Bacon.\nCertainly, the history of ceramics after the seventeenth century is inextricably\nlinked to chemistry\u2019s success at solving increasingly sophisticated questions of\nluxury pottery production.

While there are\ncertainly purely stylistic and iconographic motivations behind such depictions\n(similar layouts are used in other genre paintings not showing chymists), the\naccounts of Grill\u2019s workshop do add a level of verisimilitude to these artistic\nrepresentations that we might not otherwise have attributed to them.

Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Chymical fire analysis was a widely debated technique used in the early modern period to investigate the composition of materials through the application of heat. Key points about <strong>chymical fire analysis</strong> include:

1. <strong>Thermal Analysis and Material Composition</strong>:
   Chymical fire analysis was used to separate materials into their constituent elements through heat, aiming to uncover their hidden properties. This method was especially important for understanding ceramic bodies and porcelain, where the application of heat helped reveal thermal qualities and the resistance of materials to vitrification and other processes.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Thermal analysis was an important element in the practices of both individuals and evidence presented in the archaeological record demonstrates Dwight’s re-firing of Chinese sherds.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 203](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=203)

2. <strong>Challenges of Fire Analysis</strong>:
   Despite its usefulness, fire analysis had limitations. It was particularly ineffective in reversing phase changes in materials like ceramics that had undergone firing. Once a material’s crystalline structure was altered, it resisted further analysis, making it difficult to uncover the material’s original composition. 
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The limiting factor of fire analysis... is its inability to undo changes in crystalline structure during the initial firing of an object.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 207](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=207)

3. <strong>Debates Over Fire Analysis</strong>:
   Figures such as Francis Bacon and Robert Boyle questioned the reliability of fire analysis. They argued that fire could alter substances in unpredictable ways, confounding the process rather than simply separating materials. This debate influenced how later chymists approached thermal experiments and shaped the philosophical context of the practice.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Robert Boyle questioned the role of fire in analysis, based on the uncertainty of its ability to alter rather than separate substances.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 206](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=206)

Chymical fire analysis, despite its limitations, was central to early modern experiments in ceramics and other materials, linking practical craft processes with philosophical and scientific inquiry.

The last line\nof the table is an analysis of the body composition of porcelain produced at Meissen\nafter approximately 1727 demonstrating changes that reduced the firing temperature of the material and brought it more directly into line with its Chinese inspiration. That this change was made after the gradual dissemination of the letters of\nPe\u0300re d\u2019Entrecolles describing the process observed in China must be viewed as a\nfinal indication of the impact that thermal experimentation had on establishing the\nqualities of the earliest commercial European porcelain.\nThe chemical differences are a quantifiable demonstration that, while allowing a\nsophisticated application of experimental process to solve the problem of producing\nporcelain, thermal experiments in the seventeenth century were unable to fully\n198\nM.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The use of <strong>thermal analysis and material composition</strong> in chymistry was essential for understanding and innovating ceramic and other material production in early modern Europe. Here are key insights based on the text:

1. <strong>Application in Ceramic Bodies</strong>:
   Chymists and artisans used thermal analysis to investigate the properties of ceramic materials, especially in porcelain production. By applying controlled heat, they could observe how materials like clay reacted during the firing process, including changes in vitrification, liquefaction points, and the failure of materials. These experiments were crucial in determining the optimal composition of ceramic bodies for producing high-quality porcelain.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Thermal experimentation will be considered as a foundational element toward a chymical solution to the problem of porcelain production.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 201](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=201)

2. <strong>Limitations of Fire Analysis</strong>:
   While thermal analysis was a key tool, it had its limitations. Fire could not always reverse the changes that occurred during the initial firing, such as phase shifts in the crystalline structure. This made it difficult to analyze certain materials fully and identify their original compositions after firing.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The limiting factor of fire analysis... is its inability to undo changes in crystalline structure during the initial firing of an object.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 207](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=207)

3. <strong>Tschirnhaus and Burning Lenses</strong>:
   Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus used burning lenses as part of his thermal experimentation. These lenses allowed for rapid heating of materials and provided more control over the firing process, which was critical in developing European porcelain. His approach marked a significant advancement in ceramic production, particularly in reducing firing times and improving temperature control.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Tschirnhaus’s burning lenses allowed for results to be obtained in minutes, and greater specificity in the temperature and period of heating.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 217](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=217)

4. <strong>Influence on European Porcelain Production</strong>:
   The success of thermal analysis in porcelain production, particularly at Meissen, demonstrated the impact of these experiments. By refining the firing process, European artisans could replicate some of the qualities of Chinese porcelain, thus establishing a new standard for luxury ceramics in Europe.
   
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The legacy of thermal analysis on European porcelain production... was critical in achieving the first successes.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 216](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=216)

In Aristotelian matter theory, fire is the lightest element that\nfinds its natural place at the most peripheral region of the sub-lunar world.

Leonardo\u2019s goals are both technological and scientific; the\nfire works as a drill. If this were to be verified, it could be used in some technological application but it could also assume a more general scientific and philosophical\nexplanation because the power of fire, like the power of the other elements (water,\nair and earth), manifests itself in the form of a spiral\u2014the natural screw.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The debates surrounding <strong>chymical fire analysis</strong> during the 17th century brought to light various methodological and philosophical challenges, particularly regarding its accuracy and limitations. Here are key points:

1. <strong>Influence of Aristotelian Thought</strong>:
   The rejection of Aristotelian philosophy in the 17th century was a significant factor in the debate over fire analysis. The empirical methods being developed by chymists such as George Starkey were heavily influenced by the evolving tension between Aristotelian thought and the emerging scientific methods. Starkey’s notebooks, for example, documented the use of fire analysis with annotations like *refutata per ignem* (refuted by fire). However, this approach was criticized for altering substances rather than revealing their true nature.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The debate over the acceptability of fire analysis was closely linked to the ongoing conflict waged against Aristotelian thought.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 207](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=207)

2. <strong>Inability to Reverse Crystalline Changes</strong>:
   One of the most significant limitations of fire analysis was its inability to undo the phase changes caused during initial firing. This limitation, particularly in ceramics, made it difficult to analyze the original composition of materials after they had been subjected to high heat. Once fired, ceramics’ crystalline structures were permanently altered, rendering them resistant to further thermal or chemical analysis.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The limiting factor of fire analysis... is its inability to undo changes in crystalline structure during the initial firing of an object.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 207](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=207)

3. <strong>Boyle and Bacon’s Criticisms</strong>:
   Both Robert Boyle and Francis Bacon expressed skepticism about the reliability of fire analysis. They believed that fire could alter the substance it was meant to analyze, thereby confounding results. Boyle, in particular, questioned whether fire separated or altered the components of a body, which made it difficult to trust the conclusions derived from such experiments.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Boyle questioned the role of fire in analysis, based on the uncertainty of its ability to alter rather than separate substances.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 206](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=206)

4. <strong>Impact on Ceramic Innovation</strong>:
   These debates influenced the development of ceramics in early modern Europe. For example, John Dwight’s work in ceramic innovation was hampered by the limitations of fire analysis. Despite his advanced understanding of firing temperatures, Dwight was unable to fully replicate Chinese porcelain due to his reliance on fire analysis, which could not offer insights into the specific composition of the materials.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Due to the restrictions of his fire analysis, he was unable to disprove Bacon’s speculation that there was an ‘artificial mineral’ employed in the production of porcelain.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 208](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=208)

These challenges illustrate the evolving nature of fire analysis and the debates over its utility and accuracy, shaping both alchemical and material innovations during the early modern period.

It was Albertus\u2019s intention to comment on the\nwhole Aristotle, i.e. to commentate the texts that were in the thirteenth century\nconsidered to be the Aristotelian philosophical works on nature. Therefore it is no\nwonder that he, believing that Aristotle\u2019s treatise was lost, commenced his own\nLapidary (Book of Stone): \u201cWe have not seen Aristotle\u2019s books about these\n[minerals], but only some excerpts from them; and what Avicenna says about\n[minerals] in the third chapter of the first book which he wrote about them is not\nsufficient.\u201d13 Thus, Albertus\u2019s text is an advancement of the Aristotelian systems,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=107\nPages: 107\nTwo important preliminary writings, Aristotle\u2019s reflections on meteorology and\nAlbertus Magnus\u2019s (1193\u20131280) Libri cinque de mineralibus et rebus metallicis,\nare considered by Agricola and other early modern authors and are present in\nalmost all theories of the sixteenth century. With Albertus\u2019s De mineralibus an\nimportant testimony to the transmission of antique metallurgic knowledge and its\ncombination with alchemical concepts has been preserved. That Albertus\u2019s knowledge was not out of date in the early modern period is attested by the two prints of\nhis works by Giovanni and Gregorius de Gregoriis in Venice (De mineralibus,\n1495) and of Jacob Ko\u0308bel (Liber mineralium, 1518) in Oppenheim.

Abdera is a Thracian town;\nbut he became a very wise man when he came to Egypt and was initiated by the great\nmagician Ostanes with all Egyptian priests. He got from Ostanes the bases [of the alchemical processes] and wrote four books on dyeing, that is, on gold and silver and precious\nstones and purple.14\nThe great relevance ps.-Democritus\u2019s four books had in the later alchemical\ntradition\u2014that is unanimous in recognizing the atomist as one of the founders of\nthis discipline\u2014allows us to consider the four areas of expertise included in his\nwork as relevant parts of the technical background from which alchemy took its first\nsteps in the first-second century AD. The four books are concisely defined by]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=108\nPages: 108,109\npower to achieve the destined form.\nHere Albertus merges an alchemical concept with ideas from Aristotle extracted\nfrom his Generation of Animals. He equates a female principle with the material\ncause, i.e. the shapeless matter, subjected to an efficient cause, a forming principle\nthat is inherent in the male semen. To initiate this transformational process Albertus\nintroduces the celestial bodies as impulses. After discussing the material and\nefficient cause he then treats the third, the formal cause, where he follows Aristotle\nwho said that the male principle contributes the form of the offspring, i.e. the\n14\n15\nAlbertus, Book of Minerals, XXXI.\nAristoteles, \u201cMeteorologie,\u201d 136.\n86\nH.

The Grand Duke Cosimo I had\nalready given decisive impulse to all areas of scientific activities within the framework of state centralized structures.

Gabriele Falloppio and Realdo Colombo taught\nanatomy (after Ve\u0301sale\u2019s short stay), Luca Ghini the study of herbs and Giovanni\nArgentario taught medicine. In 1567, at the expense of the doctors and\napothecaries\u2019s corporation, Cosimo I edited the new Ricettario Fiorentino, a\ncorrected version of the one from 1498.52 He also established harsh penalties for\nthose who practised medicine or surgery without obtaining the required titles from a\ndoctors\u2019 college.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The influence of Aristotelian philosophy during the Renaissance, particularly in the context of alchemy and natural philosophy, was profound. Here are some key insights:

1. <strong>Albertus Magnus and Aristotelian Systems</strong>:
   Albertus Magnus&#x27; work was an important bridge between Aristotelian thought and alchemical concepts. His *Book of Minerals* advanced Aristotle’s framework by integrating it with empirical observations, especially from his time spent in mining districts. He merged Aristotelian ideas of the material, efficient, formal, and final causes with alchemical practices, shaping the understanding of substances such as metals and minerals.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Albertus’s text is an advancement of the Aristotelian systems, which he blends with alchemical texts and concepts obtained from Arabic sources.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 107](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=107)

2. <strong>Aristotle&#x27;s Meteorology and Alchemical Knowledge</strong>:
   Early modern alchemists and metallurgists frequently referenced Aristotle’s works, especially his reflections on meteorology, which shaped theories about the formation of metals and minerals. This Aristotelian framework informed many natural philosophers of the time and was present in alchemical practices used by early metallurgists.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;Two important preliminary writings, Aristotle’s reflections on meteorology and Albertus Magnus’s *De Mineralibus*... are present in almost all theories of the sixteenth century.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 107](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=107)

3. <strong>Aristotelian Framework in Fire Analysis</strong>:
   The debates surrounding the use of fire analysis in alchemy were tied to the conflict against Aristotelian thought. In the 17th century, figures like George Starkey applied fire analysis to experimental processes, but this method faced criticism. Many saw fire as potentially altering substances rather than revealing their true nature, a critique that arose within the context of challenging Aristotelian principles.
   - <strong>Quote</strong>: &quot;The debate over the acceptability of fire analysis was closely linked to the ongoing conflict being waged against Aristotelian thought in the seventeenth century.&quot; [Laboratories of Art, page 207](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=207)

Aristotle’s influence on alchemical practices and natural philosophy shaped the intellectual framework of many early modern thinkers, blending empirical observation with classical philosophical concepts.

In\nmany cases the architectural changes were not apparent, since many kinds of\nartisans (e.g., the goldsmiths) kept on using the same premises they had occupied\nfor generations. However, even in such examples of apparent continuity the arts\nwere seen as vectors for change. This perception found visual expression in a\nvolume of engravings, based on drawings by Jan van der Straet (1523\u20131605)\n(or Giovanni Stradano), that bore the significant title Nova Reperta, commissioned\nby the Florentine academician Luigi Alamanni (1558\u20131603) around the end of the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios. These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52\nPages: 52\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources.

Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities. Within our corpus several\nalchemical treatises and recipes are attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus\n(c.1190\u20131280), Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c.1240\u20131311) or Roger Bacon (1214\u2013]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nproduction behind these texts, as well as their compilation and dissemination,\nelucidates information about the former nature and the previous and current function of these writings.20 Answering these questions would: first, help to better\nestimate the relevance of these books when using them as a historical source for\nreconstructing part of mediaeval and premodern alchemical and artistic knowledge.\nAnd second, examining the various connections and similarities between these two\nfields, as described within recipe books, would serve to (re)situate them in their\nhistorical and cultural contexts.\nThe Sources and the Context of Production\nFirst of all, the wide diversity of subjects and fields embedded within the corpus begs\nthe question: were they written by several authors?

Smith in The Body of the Artisan in 2004 and by Pamela O. Long in Artisan/\nPractitioners in 2011.45 Again in 2004, Davis Baird\u2019s contribution on \u2018thing\nknowledge\u2019 focussed on a \u2018philosophy of scientific instruments\u2019 and distinguishes\nwithin this epistemology of the artificial object three forms in which an instrument\ncan represent knowledge: firstly as model, secondly as product and medium of\nworking knowledge and thirdly as embodiment of \u2018encapsulated knowledge\u2019. His\ntheoretical system not only applied to scientific instruments, but can also be adapted\nto other artificially created objects, for instance to the Handsteine.

In fact, in the early modern period, they were often so similar in terms of the\ninstruments they contained that they carried the same name. This material culture\nremained largely the same. A change took place at another level: the increasing\npresence of books and texts in laboratories and workshops populated by figures who\nmerged artisanal and scholarly cultures. This book suggests that this shift in\nworkshop culture facilitated the epistemic exchanges between alchemists and producers of the decorative arts.\nAcknowledgements\nThis book was conceived and written in dialogue with an exhibition project \u201cArt\nand Alchemy.

They also include magical\nrecipes, dietetical instructions or advice on home-economics. All these various\ndisciplines are embedded within the genre of the Fachliteratur.13 This kind of\nliterature regroups all texts of a utilitarian and informative nature whose content\ndoes not principally concern aesthetic or religious issues, or matters relating to\nemotional purpose.14 A great number of these writings share the same format and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=66\nPages: 66\n(collection(s) of) text(s). By displaying the various ways alchemical and artistic\nrecipes are embedded within the same manuscript, this study has highlighted the\npotential difficulties in localizing and distinguishing them.\nOn the other hand, it has been demonstrated that recipe books partly derived\nfrom the recording and transmission of (more or less) contemporaneous practices.\nThus, recipe books also reflect alchemical and artistic knowledge and interests of\nboth scribes and contemporary scholars, both of whom could be involved as readers\nor authorities. Recipe books also serve to define a more precise network in which\nthese types of knowledge circulated, delivering information about the \u2018actors\u2019\u2014\nwhether artisans, scholars, natural philosophers, (theoretical) alchemists or lay\nscribes\u2014and their interconnections, as well as the media (copy, oral source,\nexperiment) they used to exchange, share and communicate art and alchemy.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=22\nPages: 22,23\nthe Technical University, Berlin.

Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities. Within our corpus several\nalchemical treatises and recipes are attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus\n(c.1190\u20131280), Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c.1240\u20131311) or Roger Bacon (1214\u2013]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=193\nPages: 193\nmanuscripts also reveal a wider circle of closely-knit chymists active in Paris\nthroughout the 1650s and 1660s. This circle included, besides Duclos and Digby,\nthe abbe\u0301 Jullien de Loberie (chaplain of the Colle\u0300ge Fortet) and an abbe\u0301 Boucaud,\nThomas Gobelin (member of a prominent family and counselor to the Paris\nParlement), the chymical authors Jean-Baptiste de la Noue, Pierre Borel, and\nFranc\u0327ois de Soucy, Sieur de Gerzan, as well as a host of others. The group shared\nmanuscripts, processes, and other information gathered from books or private\ncorrespondence, and collaborated (in various combinations) on practical chymical\nprocesses, most frequently of a transmutational nature.

These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=56\nPages: 56\nA small number of these writings are produced in the form of carefully presented\nand independent collections: they are written in metallogallic ink and are quite\noften embellished with titles in red, and rubrics. These examples may be relatively\nhomogeneous: usually, only one or two scribes (who are contemporaneous) can be\nidentified and the presentation of their texts is almost identical. Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting). They are informally\nwritten, with no decoration, and are characterized by apparently random presentation\nand inconsistent structure.\nThe recipe titles, which do not always correspond to the procedure that follows\nthem, do not imply a coherent organization. This second type of manuscript was]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=198\nPages: 198\nsource of random observations made casually in the course of exercising their\ncraft, they initiated projects, conducted experiments, made innovations, read\nlearned treatises, and communicated or collaborated with more traditionallyeducated or more natural philosophically inclined members. While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well. These examples thus begin to resituate the role of\nsuch artisan-chymists within the larger ambit of chymistry. While not erased, the\nneat division of artisan and natural philosopher emerges considerably blurred.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=61\nPages: 61\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts.

These modifications or omissions sometimes concern primary data, such as the name of the\ningredients or materials, or may be related to some of the steps of the procedure.\nAt each stage of the copying process, variations or errors can occur. This phenomenon can be explained in several ways: it could be an attempt to improve or to\ndiversify a previous formula; it could be a quid pro quo, in which an unknown or\nexpensive ingredient is substituted with a more well known or less expensive one; it\nmay have been a voluntary reduction of the recipe text.\nIf we suppose that the function of a recipe book was practical or instructive, this\nfunction could be the motivation behind changes to the recipes.

However, the tendency for an older authority to be cited in the\nrecipe books is particularly characteristic of the alchemical writings and less typical\nof the art-technological recipes. As stated above, such citations primarily served to\nlegitimate the technical and chemical procedures. In addition, most alchemical\nrecipes describe processes and practical results to validate previously enounced\ntheoretical principles. Thus, more than artistic recipes, alchemical instructions\nemphasize the efficacy of the procedure which is frequently confirmed through\nexpressions such as expertum es or probatum est which are placed at the beginning]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=57\nPages: 57\nlater owner punctuate the distinct recipes within the manuscripts.

Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52\nPages: 52\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources. This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities.

In this context the marginal notes and additions made by\nthe scribes/authors of the recipe book are of interest as most of them are technical\ncomments testifying practical interest in both alchemical and artistic instructions.\nSeveral marginal annotations due to Seidel\u2019s hand punctuate the Cgm 4117 and\nconsist in personal commentaries regarding the technical procedures he records.\nFor example, on folio 53r, Seidel compares two ways for the melting of crystal.\nConcerning the first process he states in the margin that this \u2018art\u2019 was not of use to\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=57\nPages: 57\nthey collected their data and specify the dates of these events, which span several\nyears.

The Prager Malerbuch had several\nowners and circulated through several localities before entering the monastery of\nZlata\u0301 Koruna. According to a note written by Federl Mir, the main scribe of the\nPrager Malerbuch, this manuscript was written c.1452, in Tittmoning in the district\nof Traunstein (Bavaria). This place probably corresponds to the original provenance\nof the recipe book. Moreover, the scribe tells us that he has gathered data from\nMichel Schril, a professor in Vienna, who passed away in 1472. We also know that]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios. These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=35\nPages: 35\n11\nthe ninth book of Imouth, reading as follows:30 \u201cThe Holy Scriptures, that is the\nbooks, say, my lady (i.e. Theosebeia),31 that there is a race of demons who avail\nthemselves of women. Hermes also mentioned this in his Physika, and nearly\nevery treatise, both public and esoteric, made mention of this. Thus the ancient\nand divine scriptures said this, that certain angels lusted after women, and having\ndescended taught them all the works of nature. For this reason they fell into\ndisgrace, he (Hermes?) says, and remained outside heaven, because they taught\nmankind everything wicked and nothing benefiting the soul. The same scriptures\nsay that from them the giants were born. So theirs is the first teaching concerning\nthese arts [Chemeu].

But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied.

On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

While The Book\nof Enoch presented Azae\u0304l\u2019s revelation in the form of oral teaching, Zosimus\nunderlines the written form in which mankind received this secret knowledge.\nThe arts and all the natural procedures (Sync. 14,7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4~\n\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u00bcSyrZos. 49r19\u201320\n) disclosed by demons had been somehow\nsummarized in the enigmatic books called Che\u0304meu, from which the related term\nche\u0304meia (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 or\n, kumiya) derives. However, while the Final Account insists\non demons\u2019 increasing jealousy towards mankind and on their attempt to gain\ncontrol of the revealed techniques, the Syriac text stresses the point that the original\nknowledge started deteriorating because of the improper use human beings made of\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64\nPages: 64\neasily fill in the lacuna that punctuated the text of the recipe.\nAs previously observed, citations of authority were frequently used by the scribes\nof the manuscripts. However, the tendency for an older authority to be cited in the\nrecipe books is particularly characteristic of the alchemical writings and less typical\nof the art-technological recipes. As stated above, such citations primarily served to\nlegitimate the technical and chemical procedures. In addition, most alchemical\nrecipes describe processes and practical results to validate previously enounced\ntheoretical principles. Thus, more than artistic recipes, alchemical instructions\nemphasize the efficacy of the procedure which is frequently confirmed through\nexpressions such as expertum es or probatum est which are placed at the beginning]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=193\nPages: 193\nmanuscripts also reveal a wider circle of closely-knit chymists active in Paris\nthroughout the 1650s and 1660s. This circle included, besides Duclos and Digby,\nthe abbe\u0301 Jullien de Loberie (chaplain of the Colle\u0300ge Fortet) and an abbe\u0301 Boucaud,\nThomas Gobelin (member of a prominent family and counselor to the Paris\nParlement), the chymical authors Jean-Baptiste de la Noue, Pierre Borel, and\nFranc\u0327ois de Soucy, Sieur de Gerzan, as well as a host of others. The group shared\nmanuscripts, processes, and other information gathered from books or private\ncorrespondence, and collaborated (in various combinations) on practical chymical\nprocesses, most frequently of a transmutational nature. Some of them frequented\nwell-known intellectual groupings such as the academy of the abbe\u0301 Bourdelot.43\nThe travelling savants Borrichius and Henry Oldenburg (1619\u20131677) also\ninteracted with the group during their visits to Paris.\nSeveral documents record the participation of goldsmiths in this Parisian]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=38\nPages: 38\nthe revealed books. In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours. This explanation is consistent with Zosimus\u2019s other\n39\nFestugie\u0300re, Re\u0301ve\u0301lation d\u2019Herme\u0300s, 365, ll. 15\u201320 (\u00bc CAAG II 242,10\u20136). The name of Isidoros\nappears also in the list of alchemists handed down by the Marcianus gr. 299 (fol. 7v); see CAAG I\n110.\n40\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that other treatises circulating under the name of Hermes]&quot;]}

Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=56\nPages: 56\nA small number of these writings are produced in the form of carefully presented\nand independent collections: they are written in metallogallic ink and are quite\noften embellished with titles in red, and rubrics. These examples may be relatively\nhomogeneous: usually, only one or two scribes (who are contemporaneous) can be\nidentified and the presentation of their texts is almost identical. Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting). They are informally\nwritten, with no decoration, and are characterized by apparently random presentation\nand inconsistent structure.\nThe recipe titles, which do not always correspond to the procedure that follows\nthem, do not imply a coherent organization. This second type of manuscript was]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities\nlinked to \u2018authorship\u2019.50 Scribes also made attempts to ensure that the recipes could\nbe consulted at need: they composed tables of contents or indexes, they introduced\ntitles within the margins and many other details which attest to a real desire to\ndeliver usable information. In this context the marginal notes and additions made by\nthe scribes/authors of the recipe book are of interest as most of them are technical\ncomments testifying practical interest in both alchemical and artistic instructions.\nSeveral marginal annotations due to Seidel\u2019s hand punctuate the Cgm 4117 and\nconsist in personal commentaries regarding the technical procedures he records.\nFor example, on folio 53r, Seidel compares two ways for the melting of crystal.\nConcerning the first process he states in the margin that this \u2018art\u2019 was not of use to\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=57\nPages: 57\nlater owner punctuate the distinct recipes within the manuscripts. In fact, these\nadditions mostly appear under the form of titles or details given as a counterpart to\nthe instructions. In the Ms. Vadiana 429 from St. Gallen, a great number of\nadditional notes consist of technical commentaries and supplementary notes\nadded to those of the compiler of the manuscript. In the Nuremberg Hs. 33733, a\nlater owner added several titles and remarks within the margins. Some of these\nmarginal additions also mention the name of the person from whom the scribe may\nhave obtained the data he is adding. For example, in the Vienna Ms. 5224, fol.\n74, the scribe indicated the name of a physician, \u201cDoctor Jorg erffordie,\u201d before the\ntitle of a recipe dedicated to the production of sal ammoniac. On folio 105 of the\nsame manuscript, the scribe associated an alchemical procedure with the name\n\u201cMarggrauff von Ro\u0308tell\u201d by mentioning him in the upper margin.

Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting).

Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52\nPages: 52\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources.

These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nproduction behind these texts, as well as their compilation and dissemination,\nelucidates information about the former nature and the previous and current function of these writings.20 Answering these questions would: first, help to better\nestimate the relevance of these books when using them as a historical source for\nreconstructing part of mediaeval and premodern alchemical and artistic knowledge.\nAnd second, examining the various connections and similarities between these two\nfields, as described within recipe books, would serve to (re)situate them in their\nhistorical and cultural contexts.\nThe Sources and the Context of Production\nFirst of all, the wide diversity of subjects and fields embedded within the corpus begs\nthe question: were they written by several authors?

In fact, these\nadditions mostly appear under the form of titles or details given as a counterpart to\nthe instructions. In the Ms. Vadiana 429 from St. Gallen, a great number of\nadditional notes consist of technical commentaries and supplementary notes\nadded to those of the compiler of the manuscript. In the Nuremberg Hs. 33733, a\nlater owner added several titles and remarks within the margins. Some of these\nmarginal additions also mention the name of the person from whom the scribe may\nhave obtained the data he is adding. For example, in the Vienna Ms. 5224, fol.\n74, the scribe indicated the name of a physician, \u201cDoctor Jorg erffordie,\u201d before the\ntitle of a recipe dedicated to the production of sal ammoniac. On folio 105 of the\nsame manuscript, the scribe associated an alchemical procedure with the name\n\u201cMarggrauff von Ro\u0308tell\u201d by mentioning him in the upper margin. This observation]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as\nmanuals written for the practitioner. But neither were these compendium written\npurely for scholarly purposes, deprived of any practical function. In parallel to the\ndata that could be considered part of the technical heritage of a earlier period, these\nrecipe books also contain more recent practical instructions\u2014coming from contemporary artists and practicing scholars or from the scribe\u2019s own experiments, as the\nexamples of Seidel, Freising and Schobinger discussed above illustrate. Even when\nthe writing of these instructions, verbalized in the rhetoric of the recipes, was\ncarried out by scribes, data were not blindly copied. Scribes organised, assembled,\ncompleted or corrected when they felt it necessary. Thus, even if they were not the\nauthor per se, in the sense that they were not the origin or the source of the technical\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59\nConclusion\nExamination of the processes of making, compiling and disseminating this corpus\nof mediaeval and premodern recipe books provides us with information concerning\ntheir nature and former function. One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person.

Yet such\nartworks do not necessarily indicate that the artists were actually in direct and\nmeaningful contact with chymists. On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

Indeed,\nin general, medical and pharmaceutical recipes had an important place within\nreligious communities. In this regard, art\u2013technological recipes also found their\nplace and could be linked with the art of writing and illuminating involved in\nscriptorial activity. The tables of contents of recipe books can be quite edifying on\nthis point. For example, the table of contents in Munich Bayerische Staatsbibliothek\nClm 20174 informs us that the artistic instructions were intended for the use of the\nscribes and illuminators of the scriptorium (Et alia multa utilia per scriptoribus et\nilluministarum, Clm 20174, fol. 1). In this context, scribe and illuminator, when not\nrepresented by the same person, worked side by side to produce manuscripts.24 This]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=60\nPages: 60\nor chemical procedures they wrote down, they accomplished a set of activities\nlinked to \u2018authorship\u2019.50 Scribes also made attempts to ensure that the recipes could\nbe consulted at need: they composed tables of contents or indexes, they introduced\ntitles within the margins and many other details which attest to a real desire to\ndeliver usable information. In this context the marginal notes and additions made by\nthe scribes/authors of the recipe book are of interest as most of them are technical\ncomments testifying practical interest in both alchemical and artistic instructions.\nSeveral marginal annotations due to Seidel\u2019s hand punctuate the Cgm 4117 and\nconsist in personal commentaries regarding the technical procedures he records.\nFor example, on folio 53r, Seidel compares two ways for the melting of crystal.\nConcerning the first process he states in the margin that this \u2018art\u2019 was not of use to\nhim as a better (method) is delivered on 219.51 Then on folio 219, he indicates]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=18\nPages: 18\nconference hosted at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in March\n2013.

In the first case, alchemical content may\nappear concurrently with an artist\u2019s recipe book within the same manuscript but in a\nseparate section. When this occurs, the texts mostly consist of quite theoretical\nalchemical treatises, often associated with the name of a former or contemporary\nauthority. Most of them are attributed to the (pseudo) Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon\nand Arnaldus de Villa Nova whose writings date from an earlier period. These works\ncould also be \u2018physically\u2019 distinct works, delimited to a quire or a booklet\u2014or even a\nfolio\u2014and assembled with the rest of the manuscript at a contemporary or later\nperiod.

Neven\nfrom the master to the apprentice.49 A large number of the manuscripts of this study\nresult from copying and compilation processes undertaken by scribes. As they were\ncopied in a context outside the workshop or the laboratory, these recipes were not\nrevised and, consequently, conveyed an anachronistic technical tradition that\nbecame more and more outdated.\nSuch observations seem to argue against the view that sees these books as]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=61\nPages: 61\nbooks, and in alchemical or magical texts. Frequently, the copyist was free to add,\nto remove or to omit some words or even some parts of the text. These modifications or omissions sometimes concern primary data, such as the name of the\ningredients or materials, or may be related to some of the steps of the procedure.\nAt each stage of the copying process, variations or errors can occur. This phenomenon can be explained in several ways: it could be an attempt to improve or to\ndiversify a previous formula; it could be a quid pro quo, in which an unknown or\nexpensive ingredient is substituted with a more well known or less expensive one; it\nmay have been a voluntary reduction of the recipe text.\nIf we suppose that the function of a recipe book was practical or instructive, this\nfunction could be the motivation behind changes to the recipes. An author or a scribe\nmay, voluntarily, have corrected the text, or added information to it.

However, the tendency for an older authority to be cited in the\nrecipe books is particularly characteristic of the alchemical writings and less typical\nof the art-technological recipes. As stated above, such citations primarily served to\nlegitimate the technical and chemical procedures. In addition, most alchemical\nrecipes describe processes and practical results to validate previously enounced\ntheoretical principles. Thus, more than artistic recipes, alchemical instructions\nemphasize the efficacy of the procedure which is frequently confirmed through\nexpressions such as expertum es or probatum est which are placed at the beginning]&quot;]}

This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities. Within our corpus several\nalchemical treatises and recipes are attributed to (pseudo) Albertus Magnus\n(c.1190\u20131280), Arnaldus de Villa Nova (c.1240\u20131311) or Roger Bacon (1214\u2013]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\npractica, all of which are delineated and separated by blank spaces or folios. These\ntexts were written by several hands, on paper from different origins dated from the\nfifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. The main contribution comes from an anonymous scribe who is responsible for a number of independent collections of recipes\nbut also for some additions throughout other parts of the volume.54 Perhaps this\ncontributor was at the root of both the (partial) writing and the collecting and\nassembling of these data into one single volume. This theory is supported by the\nfact that his hand dates from the sixteenth century, which coincides with the\nestimated date of the binding and the titles written on the cover. Once all the diverse\nparts were bound together, the manuscript was subject to later additions by the main\nscribe, who wrote these on previously blank space (fol. 143v\u2013144r and fol. 158r,\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nproduction behind these texts, as well as their compilation and dissemination,\nelucidates information about the former nature and the previous and current function of these writings.20 Answering these questions would: first, help to better\nestimate the relevance of these books when using them as a historical source for\nreconstructing part of mediaeval and premodern alchemical and artistic knowledge.\nAnd second, examining the various connections and similarities between these two\nfields, as described within recipe books, would serve to (re)situate them in their\nhistorical and cultural contexts.\nThe Sources and the Context of Production\nFirst of all, the wide diversity of subjects and fields embedded within the corpus begs\nthe question: were they written by several authors?

The Prager Malerbuch had several\nowners and circulated through several localities before entering the monastery of\nZlata\u0301 Koruna. According to a note written by Federl Mir, the main scribe of the\nPrager Malerbuch, this manuscript was written c.1452, in Tittmoning in the district\nof Traunstein (Bavaria). This place probably corresponds to the original provenance\nof the recipe book. Moreover, the scribe tells us that he has gathered data from\nMichel Schril, a professor in Vienna, who passed away in 1472.

One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person.

These examples may be relatively\nhomogeneous: usually, only one or two scribes (who are contemporaneous) can be\nidentified and the presentation of their texts is almost identical. Moreover, no\nadditional material modifies the original volume.\nOthers (though not the majority) are quite heterogeneous, both in their content\n(medical, theological, astronomical, technical, household) and in their physical\nappearance (diversity of format, dialect and handwriting). They are informally\nwritten, with no decoration, and are characterized by apparently random presentation\nand inconsistent structure.\nThe recipe titles, which do not always correspond to the procedure that follows\nthem, do not imply a coherent organization.

Previous studies have established that, quite often, such writings correspond\nto apocryphal or pseudepigraphical works.21 As most recipe books are compilations, it is possible that some anonymous texts were (sometimes involuntarily)\nassembled together under the name of an authority cited in another part of the\nmanuscript and subsequently disseminated under that name. Generally, these citations acted as a testimony of authority; they legitimised the alchemical knowledge\nrecorded in these books. No doubt, the typical attraction and reverence for ancient\nauthorities on the one hand, and the opportunity to record a (presumably) non\nanonymous text on the other hand, favoured the dissemination of these writings.22\nThe association with the name of an authority gave rise to a tradition of works\nwhich, due to the processes of copying and compilation, circulated under various]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=72\nPages: 72,71\nLanguage:\nBavarian\nPrevious owner: fol. 1r \u201815R74 Siluester Schafman von Hamerberg I-B-G (?)\u2019\n\u2013 141871, 16th century (beginning)\nLanguage: Middle German\n\u2013 147699, c.1488\u20131490\nLanguage: Swabian and Bavarian dialects\nPrague, Narodni Knihovna\n\u2013 Cod.

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production.

A priori, palaeographical examination tends to confirm this: as with a large number of recipe books produced during\nmediaeval and premodern times, the manuscripts examined were written by several\n17]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=52\nPages: 52\nwere compiled from three different types of source:\n1. content produced by copying and compiling of other written sources;\n2. practical information obtained from personalities (practitioner or not) cited by\nthe scribes;\n3. content possibly derived from personal contributions made by the scribes.\nIn some instances, most of the content came from the copying and compilation of\nother written sources. This process can be followed by tracing the repeated appearances of certain popular texts found in the manuscripts of that period. Taking a\nwider view, these books have a great number of texts in common\u2014dedicated to\nmedicine, pharmacology, herbal, cosmetic, etc.\u2014which were widely copied and\ndisseminated in mediaeval and premodern times. These texts are quite often\nassociated with the name of older or quoted authorities.

One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes.

Further, it should be noted that these first arcanists are entirely separate\nfrom communities and guilds of potters in their various regions, offering an entirely\nnovel actor class that appears at the end of the seventeenth century, chymists whose\nfocus was on the production of translucent ceramics rather than metallurgical,\nmedical, or other natural philosophical avenues.\nNo evidence towards production of a hard-paste porcelain body by European\npotters before the eighteenth century is extant, leaving the chymist\u2019s laboratory as\nthe principle space of ceramic innovation.

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production.

One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person.

While someone like\nAnthoni Grill was undoubtedly an exceptional figure, he nevertheless serves to\nillustrate one end of the spectrum of possible social and intellectual positions\noccupied by early modern gold- and silversmiths. His active participation and\neventual notoriety and success indicate the social boundaries that were crossed\nwithin the network, a situation that also existed with Caillart and Roussel and others\nin the French context as well.

In this context, from a technological point of view, the term\n\u2018transmutation\u2019 could refer to the colouring of glass, the melting and tinting of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nthe field of \u2018science and technology of matter\u2019.\nIf we focus our attention on all the artisanal processes of substance transformation known and practiced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is easy to\nshow that they do not fit perfectly within the domain traced by alchemy. This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=14\nPages: 14\nconcern with the same materials and artisanal processes.

Principe\nAbstract The study of early modern alchemical practitioners has recently\nexpanded from the work and writings of natural philosophers to include the labors\nof artisans. Yet there remains relatively little clear documentation about the specifics\nof such artisanal chymical practices or about the degree of significant epistemic\nexchange that may have taken place between artisans and better-known chymists.\nThis paper examines several gold- and silversmiths who were part of an extended\nalchemical network that stretched across the Netherlands, France, and England in\nthe mid-seventeenth century. The silversmith Anthoni Grill (and to a lesser extent\nhis brother Andries) worked on refining and transmutational processes with impressive chymical expertise and eventually achieved international notoriety and social\nand financial success.

Thus, the artisanal experience of gold- and silversmithing provided a\ncertain commonality with the pursuit of metallic chymistry, and might easily\nhave inclined such artisans toward transmutational endeavors, and hence toward\ncontact with other aspiring transmuters who were not themselves artisans. The\npractical experience of gold- and silversmiths also rendered them sources of\ninformation for those wishing to know more about the properties and potentialities]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=9\nPages: 9,10\n\u201cmade by alchemy\u201d according to Cennino Cennini (c.1370\u2013c.1440).

In the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the term laboratorium uniquely referred to workplaces in which \u201cchemical\u201d operations were performed: smelting, combustion,\ndistillation, dissolution, and precipitation. Matteo Martelli has convincingly\nshown that no such term was available in Antiquity.5 The Papyri, containing recipes]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=77\nPages: 77\nAgricola talked about a generic art of metal as a separate activity from alchemy:\n\u201cBut concerning the art of alchemy, if it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere.

The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.

Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=178\nPages: 178\nand financial success. Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=180\nPages: 180\nepistemic exchanges or collaborations on the level of practical or theoretical\nknowledge.\nDocumented examples of extended collaborations or exchanges between artisans and natural philosophers would be both more interesting and more informative\nfor mapping out the domains and dynamics of early modern alchemical practice. A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

For example, the places in which sixteenth-century producers of fireworks developed their materials were called laboratories.9 In terms of\nmaterial culture the laboratorium, for example, one designed and equipped by\nCount Wolfgang II von Hohenlohe-Weidersheim (1546\u20131610) in the early seventeenth century, was remarkably similar to the workplaces of apothecaries, metalworkers and glassmakers.10\nBefore the emergence of mercantilist states, Renaissance courts were the most\nimportant agents in establishing laboratories. The laboratories of Rudolf II (1552\u2013\n1612) in Prague and Landgrave Moritz von Hessen-Kassel (1572\u20131632) were\nthought to bring material and intellectual rewards.11 Moritz even founded a chair\nof chymiatria at the University of Marburg in 1609.12 The teaching of Johannes\nHartmann (1561\u20131631), who was appointed to the chair, included work in the]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=17\nPages: 17,18\nat Renaissance courts.

A change took place at another level: the increasing\npresence of books and texts in laboratories and workshops populated by figures who\nmerged artisanal and scholarly cultures.

On a purely commercial level, artists would\nhave been in contact (possibly directly in some instances, but probably more\nfrequently indirectly through a retailer) with makers of chymically-prepared pigments such as vermilion or white lead, just as metalworkers and assayers would\nhave connected with producers of mineral acids, fabric-makers with dye manufacturers, and so forth.

Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials.

So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production. Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products. Vannoccio\nBiringuccio\u2019s (1480\u2013c.1539) introduction to his brief \u201cdiscourse on the art of the\npotter\u201d from his Pirotechnia of 1540, encapsulates both the recent recognition\nreceived by ceramic craft and its inseparability from fire:\n184\nM.

Designed for the then Prince Francesco by Vincenzo Borghini\n(1515\u20131580) and Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), its cabinets seem to have included\nsome of the most valuable treasures produced in the fonderia. In addition to all sorts\nof precious stones, glass and porcelain, they carefully stored the rarest natural\nspecimens and the products of alchemical experiments.26 The meaning of this\nroom and its intimate connection with Francesco I\u2019s interest in alchemy, has been\ndiscussed by many, and most recently reconstructed in the comprehensive work by\nValentina Conticelli. Thirty-two artists were employed and coordinated by Vasari\nto accomplish the work.

Although it may seem at first glance to\nbe outside the order and purpose of my writing, he who considers well will see that it is not\nunrelated to it but proper, since it is wholly dependent on the agency and power of fire if it is\nto be brought to its perfection. Moreover, the potter\u2019s glazes and colors are all substances of\nvarious metals or impure minerals and therefore belong to fire. Since it is my intention to\ntreat of fire, minerals, and metals for you, I surely should not have omitted this, particularly\nbecause it is a necessary art which enriches and is greatly praised both for its ingenuity and\nits beauty.4\nLike the other arts treated in the Pirotechnia, the action of the fire on base earths\nand minerals provided integral transformation in the objects shaped by the potter\u2019s\nhands.

Here, together with the fine arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture and jewelry making, metal carpentry, and gun casting, we find\noperations that use substance transformation, such as distillation and sublimation.\nThere is evidence that even the most important names in the history of art were\ninvolved in such workshop activities, for instance Michelangelo (1475\u20131564),\nwhose Florentine workshop, as mentioned in his correspondence with his brother,\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=103\nPages: 103\n(Ore Mountains), Harz and other regions through the methods of observation, of\ncollecting and of categorization\u2014was incorporated into scientific treatises on the\nformation of metals and helped to change and develop this domain. The artisan\u2019s\ncraft knowledge about matter and materials rarely found its way into a written form.\nIt was most commonly expressed in its suitable mode, the accomplished work of\nart.2\nThe second part of the article analyses the materials and shape of a coconut\nvessel on display in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna (Fig. 1) to see if the\naforementioned metallogenetical theories could have had an impact on the form of\na sixteenth-century art object: in this Kunstkammer object an unknown goldsmith\nfrom the Erzgebirge created a mountainous landscape, simultaneously a representation of paradise with Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge and the\ndepiction of a post-expulsion mining area populated by contemporary miners.

In fact, in the early modern period, they were often so similar in terms of the\ninstruments they contained that they carried the same name. This material culture\nremained largely the same.

But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

The failure\nwas thus not connected to any form of geological predetermination, but entirely by\nsocial constraints limiting the application of knowledge to the problem.\nThe speculation that porcelain was comprised of either special clay, fermented\nfor generations, or of crushed shell incorporated in its manufacture, was a direct\nindication that similar materials were outside the realm of contemporary craft\nknowledge.14 In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental\ntechniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as\nprototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition. It is at this\npoint that the techniques employed by chymistry, some borrowed from metallurgical assaying and the furnaces of the glassmakers in the centuries-long discourse\nbetween the disciplines, came into full application in the pursuit of ceramic\ninnovation.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nThis context applies not only to metallurgical assaying but, more generally, it\ndefines the area of the \u2018perfective arts\u2019, including all arts that use fire to work and\ntransform matter.13 In this trading zone, where Latin was scarcely known and where\ncompetition with alchemists was felt more keenly, a sub-group of artisans, artists\nand engineers kept their distance from alchemy to define a new field of \u2018chemical\ntechnology\u2019.14\nArtisanal processes could be seen as a sort of \u2018melting pot\u2019 of interwoven\npractical and theoretical knowledge coming from the world of crafts, including\nalchemy. It is prevalently in the world of artisans that we find references to\n\u2018chemical activity\u2019 during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Before there\nwere signs of a laboratory as a separate place\u2014the most ancient plans to build a\nchemical laboratory are in the Astronomiae instauratae mechanica (Wandsbek,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204\nPages: 204\nby the Benedictine monk Theophilus, thoroughly introduces the full range of\nartisanal productions valued in Europe in its first book.6 Pottery is entirely absent\nfrom this discussion of laudable arts and only appears once in the text as a canvas\nfor enameling.7 This is a continuation of pottery\u2019s position in the classical period,\nwhen earthen objects were valued as trade goods, everyday wares, or a medium for\nother decoration, not for their individual aesthetic form.8\nIt was not until advancements in the production of luxury quality European\npottery during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that the cultural perception of\nthe material changed significantly, driving engagement by the upper classes and\nnatural philosophers. An example can be found in a letter from Lorenzo de Medici\n(1449\u20131492) to the Malatesta family in 1490, favorably comparing their gift of\nmaiolica to silver objects, which is one of the earliest pieces of documentary\n4\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 392.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83\nPages: 83,84\n26\nThese admonitions against alchemy, presented for the first time by Avicenna, were known\nduring the Middle Ages as sciant artifices, see Avicenna, De congelatione et conglutinatione\nlapidum, 53\u20135; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate.\u201d; and Halleux, \u201cAlchimiste et\nl\u2019essayeur,\u201d 211.\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n61\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are one of the best sources to study the chemical\nequipment of Renaissance.

Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products. Vannoccio\nBiringuccio\u2019s (1480\u2013c.1539) introduction to his brief \u201cdiscourse on the art of the\npotter\u201d from his Pirotechnia of 1540, encapsulates both the recent recognition\nreceived by ceramic craft and its inseparability from fire:\n184\nM. Wesley\nHaving started to tell you of working potter\u2019s clay for making crucibles and shells, the wish\ncame to me to tell you of the practice of this art also. Although it may seem at first glance to]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=157\nPages: 157\nthe chemical arts was visually displayed in the series of paintings hanging in the\nStudiolo of Palazzo Vecchio, a small dark room decorated with a complex iconographic narrative. Designed for the then Prince Francesco by Vincenzo Borghini\n(1515\u20131580) and Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), its cabinets seem to have included\nsome of the most valuable treasures produced in the fonderia. In addition to all sorts\nof precious stones, glass and porcelain, they carefully stored the rarest natural\nspecimens and the products of alchemical experiments.26 The meaning of this\nroom and its intimate connection with Francesco I\u2019s interest in alchemy, has been\ndiscussed by many, and most recently reconstructed in the comprehensive work by\nValentina Conticelli. Thirty-two artists were employed and coordinated by Vasari\nto accomplish the work. Benvenuto Cellini (1500\u20131571), who shared with his\npatron a keen interest in alchemy, was meant to have taken part\u2014but his premature]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204\nPages: 204\ncame to me to tell you of the practice of this art also. Although it may seem at first glance to\nbe outside the order and purpose of my writing, he who considers well will see that it is not\nunrelated to it but proper, since it is wholly dependent on the agency and power of fire if it is\nto be brought to its perfection. Moreover, the potter\u2019s glazes and colors are all substances of\nvarious metals or impure minerals and therefore belong to fire. Since it is my intention to\ntreat of fire, minerals, and metals for you, I surely should not have omitted this, particularly\nbecause it is a necessary art which enriches and is greatly praised both for its ingenuity and\nits beauty.4\nLike the other arts treated in the Pirotechnia, the action of the fire on base earths\nand minerals provided integral transformation in the objects shaped by the potter\u2019s\nhands.

Here, together with the fine arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture and jewelry making, metal carpentry, and gun casting, we find\noperations that use substance transformation, such as distillation and sublimation.\nThere is evidence that even the most important names in the history of art were\ninvolved in such workshop activities, for instance Michelangelo (1475\u20131564),\nwhose Florentine workshop, as mentioned in his correspondence with his brother,\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=103\nPages: 103\n(Ore Mountains), Harz and other regions through the methods of observation, of\ncollecting and of categorization\u2014was incorporated into scientific treatises on the\nformation of metals and helped to change and develop this domain.

But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

The failure\nwas thus not connected to any form of geological predetermination, but entirely by\nsocial constraints limiting the application of knowledge to the problem.\nThe speculation that porcelain was comprised of either special clay, fermented\nfor generations, or of crushed shell incorporated in its manufacture, was a direct\nindication that similar materials were outside the realm of contemporary craft\nknowledge.14 In order to successfully move past these limitations, the experimental\ntechniques of the natural philosophers allowed objects from China to serve as\nprototypes for interrogation towards their properties and composition. It is at this\npoint that the techniques employed by chymistry, some borrowed from metallurgical assaying and the furnaces of the glassmakers in the centuries-long discourse\nbetween the disciplines, came into full application in the pursuit of ceramic\ninnovation.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nThis context applies not only to metallurgical assaying but, more generally, it\ndefines the area of the \u2018perfective arts\u2019, including all arts that use fire to work and\ntransform matter.13 In this trading zone, where Latin was scarcely known and where\ncompetition with alchemists was felt more keenly, a sub-group of artisans, artists\nand engineers kept their distance from alchemy to define a new field of \u2018chemical\ntechnology\u2019.14\nArtisanal processes could be seen as a sort of \u2018melting pot\u2019 of interwoven\npractical and theoretical knowledge coming from the world of crafts, including\nalchemy. It is prevalently in the world of artisans that we find references to\n\u2018chemical activity\u2019 during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Before there\nwere signs of a laboratory as a separate place\u2014the most ancient plans to build a\nchemical laboratory are in the Astronomiae instauratae mechanica (Wandsbek,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=204\nPages: 204\nby the Benedictine monk Theophilus, thoroughly introduces the full range of\nartisanal productions valued in Europe in its first book.6 Pottery is entirely absent\nfrom this discussion of laudable arts and only appears once in the text as a canvas\nfor enameling.7 This is a continuation of pottery\u2019s position in the classical period,\nwhen earthen objects were valued as trade goods, everyday wares, or a medium for\nother decoration, not for their individual aesthetic form.8\nIt was not until advancements in the production of luxury quality European\npottery during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that the cultural perception of\nthe material changed significantly, driving engagement by the upper classes and\nnatural philosophers. An example can be found in a letter from Lorenzo de Medici\n(1449\u20131492) to the Malatesta family in 1490, favorably comparing their gift of\nmaiolica to silver objects, which is one of the earliest pieces of documentary\n4\nBiringuccio, Pirotechnia (1942), 392.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute\nsubstances intrinsically and operate fundamental change.58\nAccordingly, alchemical recipes also dedicate a large part of their text to the\ndescription of chemical apparatus, tools and containers. These writings pay particular\nattention to the use of a variety of containers and receptacles and their specific\npurposes. Moreover, in several manuscripts, such as Seidel, Vienna Ms. 5224 or\nCod. Helm. 627 from Wolfenbu\u0308ttel (to cite but a few), the text is punctuated by\nillustrations of these (Fig. 2). This is rare, if not non-existent in artistic instructions.\nThese last distinguishing features of alchemical, as opposed to art-technological\ntexts, go hand in hand with the fact that practical alchemy relies on theoretical\n(or speculative) principles. Quite often, these recipes should be seen and understood\nas experientia which are meant to serve as a rational demonstration of a preceding\ntheorica.59]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83\nPages: 83,84\n26\nThese admonitions against alchemy, presented for the first time by Avicenna, were known\nduring the Middle Ages as sciant artifices, see Avicenna, De congelatione et conglutinatione\nlapidum, 53\u20135; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate.\u201d; and Halleux, \u201cAlchimiste et\nl\u2019essayeur,\u201d 211.\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n61\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are one of the best sources to study the chemical\nequipment of Renaissance. His tireless sketching during his entire career produced\na very large and uncommon collection of manuscripts that allow us to understand\nand visualize many tools, instruments and chemical processes studied, developed\nand used during the Renaissance.\nAn activity that was a sort of flywheel in involving Leonardo in the study of the\nmany aspects of bronze casting was the project of the Equestrian monument for\nFrancesco Sforza.

Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance]&quot;]}

When in the early seventeenth century\nAndreas Libavius described the ideal workplace of the chemist, he emphasized how\nit differed from the dark, smelly, secretive laboratory that was noticeably lacking in\ndecorum:\nWe do not want the chemist to neglect the exercises of piety or exempt himself from other\nduties of an upright life, simply pining away amidst his dark furnaces [. . .].

Here, together with the fine arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture and jewelry making, metal carpentry, and gun casting, we find\noperations that use substance transformation, such as distillation and sublimation.\nThere is evidence that even the most important names in the history of art were\ninvolved in such workshop activities, for instance Michelangelo (1475\u20131564),\nwhose Florentine workshop, as mentioned in his correspondence with his brother,\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=191\nPages: 191\nmore broadly metallic, and thereby elevated himself to a high social and financial\nsituation. Not only was Anthoni capable of designing, carrying out, and improving\npractical productive processes, but he also operated at a higher epistemic level,\nreading the books of at least Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) and Glauber and designing\ntherefrom new experiments and processes propria\u0302 meditatione and propria\u0302\nindustria\u0302. From his initial profession of silver- and goldsmithing and the associated\ncraft of assaying, Grill kept expanding his horizons and expertise to engage in\nsophisticated and sometimes collaborative chymical projects that reached all the\nway to that summum bonum, the preparation of the Philosophers\u2019 Stone, and he\ndesigned and built substantial and costly laboratories for his processes and explorations. The knowledge embodied in these workspaces and their instruments were\nundoubtedly transmitted to his coworkers and laborants, and certainly to Glauber]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=173\nPages: 173\nalchemical laboratory. The small, limping man with a stick looks like Don Antonio:\nhe is holding a luminescent substance probably taken from the furnace, with a\nnipper in his right hand. Next to Antonio we see an elegantly dressed older man,\nprobably the superintendent of the laboratory, who is looking at the substance held\nby Antonio. The open door on the left shows the beginning of a descending\nstaircase, suggesting that the laboratory was on the first floor. The rest of\nNapoletano\u2019s workshop offers the usual picture of an alchemical laboratory, with\nits disorderly arrangement of equipment, its furnace in a poor state, and its dirty\nfloor. Whether authentic or not, Napoletano\u2019s representation strongly suggests that\nby 1619, at the height of Galileo\u2019s success, the activities promoted in the Casino\nwere still an important feature of Medici scientific patronage.

The material\nculture supporting this laboratory work remained largely unchanged. The exception\nis the material equipment for transmutational alchemy and the making of the\nPhilosophers\u2019 Stone, which generally disappeared from laboratories together with\ntransmutational alchemy itself in the eighteenth century. Laboratories were places\nin which the study of nature and technical innovation went hand in hand.\nAs already mentioned, the term \u201claboratory\u201d was not only used to refer to the\nworkplace of the alchemist.

Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe.

These workplaces facilitated the exchange of materials\nbetween alchemy and the arts, and the attraction of the courts also made artisans\nadopt alchemical language to elevate the status of their craft. However, above all,\nthese court laboratories made possible, well beyond a shared material culture, the\nexchange of people and knowledge between the arts and alchemy. Although there is\na long tradition of experimentation in alchemy and the boundaries between alchemy\nand art technologies were fluid from the very beginnings of alchemy in Antiquity, in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries artisans became more deeply involved in\nalchemical pursuits, and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by\nscholars trained as alchemists.22 Above all, texts and books, products and symbols\nof scholarly culture, played an increasingly important role in laboratories and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=201\nPages: 201,202\ntechnology and innovation.

Both\nalchemical and artistic recipe books describe various processes for purifying and\ntransforming materials, either for improving their properties or in order to use them\nfor specific purposes. In this context, from a technological point of view, the term\n\u2018transmutation\u2019 could refer to the colouring of glass, the melting and tinting of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people? Previous research has demonstrated that investigating questions related to the authorship and the context of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83\nPages: 83,84\n26\nThese admonitions against alchemy, presented for the first time by Avicenna, were known\nduring the Middle Ages as sciant artifices, see Avicenna, De congelatione et conglutinatione\nlapidum, 53\u20135; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate.\u201d; and Halleux, \u201cAlchimiste et\nl\u2019essayeur,\u201d 211.\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n61\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are one of the best sources to study the chemical\nequipment of Renaissance.

Both\nthe alchemist and the goldsmith share the same theoretical concepts, assuming that\nsulphur and quicksilver are the two original components of all metals.

The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history. Especially its boundaries with art technology were fluid.\nThroughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the distinction between alchemy\nas strictly goldmaking and a more encompassing definition overlapping with art]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48,47\n23\n24\nS. Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances.

Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nthe field of \u2018science and technology of matter\u2019.\nIf we focus our attention on all the artisanal processes of substance transformation known and practiced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is easy to\nshow that they do not fit perfectly within the domain traced by alchemy. This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=77\nPages: 77\nAgricola talked about a generic art of metal as a separate activity from alchemy:\n\u201cBut concerning the art of alchemy, if it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere.

The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance. The medieval technological debate during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries went beyond the traditional Quaestio de alchimia]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64\nPages: 64\nexample is the proportion of mercury and sulphur proposed by mediaeval recipes\nfor the production of vermilion which is invariably incorrect.56 Very rarely are the\ncorrect chemical proportions cited.\nIn parallel, alchemical writings may involve the use of symbols or metaphors to\ndesignate substances and practices. In consequence, the way an alchemical recipe\nwas received would depend on the degree of experience of the reader-practitioner\nreading it. On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy. On the other hand, the omitted information may have\nbeen complemented by data only known to some readers and not recorded by the\ncopyist who conserves only the essential part of the recipe. If so then this kind of\nrecipe was only meant to be accessible and useable by those practitioners who could\neasily fill in the lacuna that punctuated the text of the recipe.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.\nAlchemical texts are also sometimes situated alongside an artists\u2019 recipe book,\neither before or after. If this is the case, they will be found next to technical\ninstructions dedicated to procedures similar to those described in an alchemical\ncontext, such as the imitation of gold or silver, the gilding of stones or glass, the\nmanufacture of vermilion, the purification of ultramarine, the melting of stones or\nmetals, or several dyeing procedures. The alchemical content may be delimited\nwithin the title(s), chapter(s) or table of contents or \u2018physically\u2019 circumscribed by a\nfolio or a quire. But, in most cases, there is no obvious delimitation between the two\ndistinct collections of recipes.

One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes.

Grill built large laboratories, managed laborants, engaged in\ncollaborations, mined texts for information, and shared results. Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe. Despite its well-established culture of\nsecrecy, it was not only highly visible and widely-known, but widely-practiced]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nThis context applies not only to metallurgical assaying but, more generally, it\ndefines the area of the \u2018perfective arts\u2019, including all arts that use fire to work and\ntransform matter.13 In this trading zone, where Latin was scarcely known and where\ncompetition with alchemists was felt more keenly, a sub-group of artisans, artists\nand engineers kept their distance from alchemy to define a new field of \u2018chemical\ntechnology\u2019.14\nArtisanal processes could be seen as a sort of \u2018melting pot\u2019 of interwoven\npractical and theoretical knowledge coming from the world of crafts, including\nalchemy. It is prevalently in the world of artisans that we find references to\n\u2018chemical activity\u2019 during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Both\nalchemical and artistic recipe books describe various processes for purifying and\ntransforming materials, either for improving their properties or in order to use them\nfor specific purposes.

Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors.

Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure. Assuming that\nalchemical and artistic texts have the same textual format, raises the question: did\nthey also have the same types of production and dissemination? Using a corpus of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people?

The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history.

Apart from Ladislao Reti and a few others,\nLeonardo\u2019s observations and studies on matter transformation are usually seen in\nthe context of his natural philosophy, with few references to his practical involvement as a painter and engineer during his entire career, including his vision and\nrelationship with occult science and alchemy.23\nIf we focus our attention on Leonardo\u2019s notes and drawings about substance]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=79\nPages: 79\nthe field of \u2018science and technology of matter\u2019.\nIf we focus our attention on all the artisanal processes of substance transformation known and practiced during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it is easy to\nshow that they do not fit perfectly within the domain traced by alchemy. This\nepistemological tension is usually neutralized by saying that alchemical and metallurgical disciplines are intricately interwoven and alchemists were involved in the\ndevelopment of metallurgy.11 If one supposes chemistry did not exist as an independent and autonomous discipline before the end of the seventeenth century then\nspeaking on this topic from a historical perspective in an Italian technical cultural\ncontext, some \u2018superior artisans\u2019 or \u2018artist-engineers\u2019 can be seen as having distanced themselves from alchemy by relocating its technology inside a new epistemological context in which chemical arts were developed and codified separately.12]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=77\nPages: 77\nAgricola talked about a generic art of metal as a separate activity from alchemy:\n\u201cBut concerning the art of alchemy, if it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere. I\nwill now return to the art of mining.\u201d7\nWhen talking about chemistry in the Renaissance we have to consider a variegated tradition of non-mechanical arts where chemical processes developed: pharmacy, metallurgy, glass making, dyeing, spirits distillation, agriculture cultivations\nand the preparation of colours for painting and drawing; each of these professional\nactivities involve chemical processes that are not necessarily involved in alchemical transmutation. The difference between the purpose of chemical arts and\nalchemy was also the cause of cultural and epistemological tension during the\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance. The medieval technological debate during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries went beyond the traditional Quaestio de alchimia]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=64\nPages: 64\nexample is the proportion of mercury and sulphur proposed by mediaeval recipes\nfor the production of vermilion which is invariably incorrect.56 Very rarely are the\ncorrect chemical proportions cited.\nIn parallel, alchemical writings may involve the use of symbols or metaphors to\ndesignate substances and practices. In consequence, the way an alchemical recipe\nwas received would depend on the degree of experience of the reader-practitioner\nreading it. On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy. On the other hand, the omitted information may have\nbeen complemented by data only known to some readers and not recorded by the\ncopyist who conserves only the essential part of the recipe. If so then this kind of\nrecipe was only meant to be accessible and useable by those practitioners who could\neasily fill in the lacuna that punctuated the text of the recipe.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=62\nPages: 62\n163v), both at the beginning and the end of two distinct treatises.\nAlchemical texts are also sometimes situated alongside an artists\u2019 recipe book,\neither before or after. If this is the case, they will be found next to technical\ninstructions dedicated to procedures similar to those described in an alchemical\ncontext, such as the imitation of gold or silver, the gilding of stones or glass, the\nmanufacture of vermilion, the purification of ultramarine, the melting of stones or\nmetals, or several dyeing procedures. The alchemical content may be delimited\nwithin the title(s), chapter(s) or table of contents or \u2018physically\u2019 circumscribed by a\nfolio or a quire. But, in most cases, there is no obvious delimitation between the two\ndistinct collections of recipes.

One the one hand, it has been established that\nthese manuscripts were mostly written in religious centres and that they are largely\nthe result of the copying process undertaken by scribes. Moreover, within these\nbooks, alchemical and artistic recipes were frequently recorded alongside a wide\nrange of various\u2014and a priori unrelated\u2014subjects which may have been written\nby the same person.

Several Parisian\ngoldsmiths were likewise tied into this chymical network where they exchanged\nexperimental and theoretical information with such figures as Kenelm Digby,\nSamuel Cottereau Duclos, and Johann Rudolf Glauber. In England, George Starkey\nfound that the expertise of gold- and silversmiths could, alternatively, be inconvenient when trying to sell alchemical metals. The documentation provided here blurs\nthe boundary between artisans and natural philosophers, at least in chymistry.\nAlchemy, or to speak more inclusively and less anachronistically, chymistry was a\nfamiliar topic in early modern Europe.

This seems to be the basic assumption that\nunderlies all early modern manipulation of and acting with metals: naturally formed\nminerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only\nthe mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also\nto imitate the natural processes. The discussion of early modern theories on\nmetallogenesis has shown, that the creative process of the human artist and artisan\nwas compared to the natural genesis of the divine artifex. The same primordial\nmatters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to\n\u2018nature\u2019. All four follow the same working processes, only their ability differentiates the final products. The juxtaposition of form and matter, which is thought of as\na dichotomy of active force-shaping power and passive shape-receiving material, is]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=48\nPages: 48,47\n23\n24\nS. Neven\nwritings describe processes for the manufacture, preparation and application of\nvarious types of materials and substances. The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=83\nPages: 83,84\n26\nThese admonitions against alchemy, presented for the first time by Avicenna, were known\nduring the Middle Ages as sciant artifices, see Avicenna, De congelatione et conglutinatione\nlapidum, 53\u20135; Newman, \u201cTechnology and Alchemical Debate.\u201d; and Halleux, \u201cAlchimiste et\nl\u2019essayeur,\u201d 211.\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n61\nLeonardo\u2019s manuscripts are one of the best sources to study the chemical\nequipment of Renaissance. His tireless sketching during his entire career produced\na very large and uncommon collection of manuscripts that allow us to understand\nand visualize many tools, instruments and chemical processes studied, developed\nand used during the Renaissance.\nAn activity that was a sort of flywheel in involving Leonardo in the study of the\nmany aspects of bronze casting was the project of the Equestrian monument for\nFrancesco Sforza. This was a very large bronze statue that was never cast but]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=80\nPages: 80,79\n14\nLong, Artisan/Practitioners, 94\u20136.

Here, together with the fine arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture and jewelry making, metal carpentry, and gun casting, we find\noperations that use substance transformation, such as distillation and sublimation.\nThere is evidence that even the most important names in the history of art were\ninvolved in such workshop activities, for instance Michelangelo (1475\u20131564),\nwhose Florentine workshop, as mentioned in his correspondence with his brother,\nwas involved in generic metal carpentry such as the casting and welding of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=51\nPages: 51\nprocedure for executing the transition from one colour to another, through the steps\nof the alchemical process. Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people? Previous research has demonstrated that investigating questions related to the authorship and the context of]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\nareas. But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge. But]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors. In contrast, alchemical attempts to manipulate primary qualities transmute]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121\nPages: 121\nprocesses are blended together.\nIconographically speaking the vessel represents a model of the dichotomy of\nmale/female, form/matter: Adam and Eve embody this principle and simultaneously their action indicates the beginning of every human productive action.\nAfter the Fall, every human action is per definitionem a repetition of natural\ncreative processes. Embedded in the context of the miners and the general subject\nof minerals and their genesis and extraction, is the idea of God as creator of metals\nand the human propensity to imitate this processes\u2014whether in alchemical or\nartisanal ways.46\nSecond, the Handstein as product of working knowledge: This object has also a\nmaterial significance, because it is the product of applied (al)chemical knowledge.\nEvery piece of art emanating from the goldsmith\u2019s workshop is the embodiment of\nchemical lore concerning material properties and agency.

Biringuccio expanded his perspective to include all the arts of fire,\nincluding, artillery, making gunpowder, acids preparation, pottery, goldsmithing,\nfireworks, generic distillation arts, as well as alchemy.44 If we accept his conditions,\n43\nSee Biringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1914), 27\u201340; Perifano, \u201cAlchimie\u201d; Smith, Body of the\nArtisan, 143\u20134; and Bernardoni, La conoscenza del fare, 669.\n44\nBiringuccio, De la pirotechnia (1977), fol. 123r\u20134r.\nArtisanal Processes and Epistemological Debate in the Works of Leonardo. . .\n71\nalchemy and pyrotechnics are not in contradiction, rather, in so far as they are used\nin the same philosophical concepts and the same operational practices, alchemy]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=47\nPages: 47\nfraught with difficulty. Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials. Both require procedures involving precise and specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both ultimately use identical\nrhetorical formulations that reflect a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.

This seems to be the basic assumption that\nunderlies all early modern manipulation of and acting with metals: naturally formed\nminerals are presented in the Kunstkammern next to artificialia to exhibit not only\nthe mimicry skills of the artists to imitate the natural forms used as models, but also\nto imitate the natural processes. The discussion of early modern theories on\nmetallogenesis has shown, that the creative process of the human artist and artisan\nwas compared to the natural genesis of the divine artifex. The same primordial\nmatters are available to the goldsmith and the metalworker, to the alchemist and to\n\u2018nature\u2019. All four follow the same working processes, only their ability differentiates the final products. The juxtaposition of form and matter, which is thought of as\na dichotomy of active force-shaping power and passive shape-receiving material, is]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=122\nPages: 122\ncreative processes. But it is hard to prove that the goldsmith followed the same\nideas as the alchemist, because hardly any artisans recorded their approach in\nwritten form: the goldsmith\u2019s knowledge is working, not (alchemical) codified\nknowledge; an object, such as the Handstein might count as product, evidence\nand proof, but will always remain speechless and therefore will never entirely serve\n(in our modern understanding) as an eloquent advocate to support this assumption.\nThird, encapsulated knowledge: A work of art such as the Handstein is not\n\u2018narrative\u2019 in the sense that it develops one argument and discusses it in paratactical\nform. Such an artwork visualizes the variety of knowledge\u2014the theological, the\nmontanistic, the alchemical\u2014in a synoptical way. Rather than developing an\nargument in a logical manner, it emphasizes the interdependencies of different\nareas.

But this corresponds with the interconnected nature of these fields, as\npreviously outlined: early modern concepts of metallogenesis must be understood\nas a mixture of religious connotations, their dependency on antique montanistic\ntheories as well as on alchemical lore adopted through medieval Islamic mediation.\nBeyond that, a work of art communicates in different ways than a text. The object\ntransforms the know how of the artisan as it is performed in the working process and\nblends it with the lore of the scholar into embodied, visual knowledge. This\nknowledge, encapsulated in the work of art can then be exhibited in the surroundings of the ruler, in his Kunstkammer collection as well as in processions and\ncourtly festivities.47 It is\u2014apart from instruments to measure natural phenomena,\nwhich Baird puts in the focus of his analysis \u2014not \u2018useful\u2019 in the sense that it\nembodied knowledge which can be used to gain and widen existent knowledge.

The majority are anonymous compilations of texts, which may originate from older or undetermined authorities.\nHundreds of such collections of recipes dealing both with alchemical and\nart-technological procedures were produced and disseminated in Northern Europe\nfrom the fourteenth century on, especially in German-speaking countries.\nDrawing on a delimited corpus of about 40 representative German manuscripts\ndated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, this paper investigates the\nconnections and similarities between these two fields and examines the various\nways alchemical and artistic instructions were embedded within recipe books.1 It\nargues that textual form and lexical proximities within recipes from these different\ndisciplines may lead to association, contamination and confusion within this textual]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=65\nPages: 65\nParticular interest in the empirical aspects of the technical procedures is also\nmore perceptible within alchemical instructions, in comparison to artistic recipes.\nThe former pay greater attention to the chemical aspects of the craft process they\ndetail and describe more precisely each stage of the transformation of matter, from\noriginal to final (and more perfect) form. Whereas artists such as painters were\ninterested in the physical appearance of their materials, alchemists were more\ninterested in the fundamental changes that might occur within the matter. This\ncould perhaps be related to Paul of Taranto\u2019s description in the Theorica et practica\nof primary and secondary qualities and the distinct ways artists and alchemists\nworked on substances. He considered artists capable of producing only \u2018extrinsic\u2019\nor external changes as they operate on secondary or \u2018artificial\u2019 qualities such as\ncolors.

Another example is provided by the terms \u2018mercury\u2019 and\n\u2018sulfur\u2019. According to the context, these may alternatively designate the common\nsubstances used for making vermilion or the two principles of which all metals were\nthought to be composed in different proportions.19\nThus, both artistic practices and alchemy required procedures involving precise\nand specifically defined actions, prescriptions and ingredients. So both used an\nidentical rhetorical recipe formulation that reflects a \u2018step by step\u2019 procedure.\nAssuming that alchemical and artistic texts have the same format and were\nassembled within the same sort of compilation raises the question: were they\nproduced, diffused and read by the same people?

Prior to its\ninteraction with chymistry, the relationship between the potter\u2019s craft and fire was\nprincipally of a mechanical, fixative nature. As the heat of the kiln was known to\nremove the water from earthen bodies, its ability to affect permanent transformation\non the materials placed in the kiln was its principal contribution to the success of\nceramic production. Those objects existed first as trade goods rather than artisanal\nobjects and only later became valued as aesthetic products.

Alchemy can be defined as the \u2018art of transmutation\u2019,\nreferring to the perfection of base or impure matter (often metal or stone) into\nperfect substances. Alchemical procedures thus rely on artisanal/craft practices.\nAny overlap between alchemy and art-technological procedures can be explained\nby the use of identical materials and substances. Both are concerned with the\ndescription of colours\u2014especially in processes of change, the making of pigments,\nthe production of artificial gemstones, the imitation of gold and silver and the\ntransmutation of materials.

The focus on chromatic\ntransformation already found in the Papyri continues in fifteenth-century recipes.\nAlthough related to laboratory practices, Neven emphasizes that these recipe\ncollections are the products of scribal compilation and copying processes. Words\nand works are equally important elements of alchemical practices.15 Next to\nlaboratories, medieval religious institutions were also important sites of alchemical\nand art technological practice. However, as Neven points out, this does not exclude\nthat some scribes, such as the Benedictine monk Wolfgang Seidel (1491\u20131562),\ntried out recipes.\nThe scope of alchemy was from its very beginnings contested, and remained so\nthroughout its long history.

A\npromising locus for such study is to be found particularly among gold- and\nsilversmiths. On the one hand, their trade regularly involved chymical processes\nsuch as assaying, refining, and so forth, and they were thus more or less conversant\nwith chymical substances (acids, salts, metals, amalgams, etc.) and chymical\noperations (fusion, quartation, distillation, etc.) and would frequently have\nmaintained workshops equipped with the necessary equipment (furnaces, flues,\nfuel, retorts, crucibles, etc.) needed for chymical work generally.

He states that the Earth\u2019s crust absorbs water and earthy matter, thus\ncreating a certain nobilis succus as kind of mineral liquid that sediments in the\ncorridors and chasms of the mountains, there forming metallic minerals.\nThe hitherto discussed sources of early modern writers on metallogenetic questions have demonstrated\u2014despite the abundance of variety in the existing concepts\u2014that one basic assumption is nearly always present. Almost all theories offer\na dualistic system that operates on the dichotomy of a primary passive substance\nacted on by a potent cause.

According to Aristotle there are two kinds of aeroform emanations\nwhich ascend from the middle of the earth to the surface. One of these exhalationes\nis a dry fume which transforms into earth and stones, the other a humid steam,\nwhich condenses into metals:\nWe maintain that there are two exhalations, one vaporous the other smoky, and there\ncorrespond two kinds of bodies that originate in the earth, \u2018fossils\u2019 and metals.

This is evident in Mathesius\u2019s\n\u201cThird Sermon,\u201d where he names the planets and their connection and influence on\nthe seven main metals. He distinguishes gold, golden silver, silver, copper, iron,\nsteel, lead, tin, bismuth, mercury and spie\u00dfglas and thus clearly enumerates more\nthan seven metals. Mathesius\u2019s text probably refers to the writings of Agricola, who\nemphasises the autonomy of bismuth and who uses the addition of this eighth\nspecies to the main metals as his most powerful argument against the star-forming\ntheories of metals:\nAccording to the opinion of the astrologers, the planet is constantly under the influence of\nforces that work on suitable substances in the womb of the earth and this create the ores.]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=194\nPages: 194\nto sunlight and/or moonlight and subterranean conditions continued within the\ngroup\u2014now at the hands of others, often more prominent natural philosophers,\nfor at least a decade after the initial report.

For example, the initial insistence that\nparticular astrological conditions were necessary seems to have been debunked and\ndiscarded. Duclos, for his part, saw the experiment as a route to the Philosophers\u2019\nStone that he was seeking: \u201cI believe that this gold thus prepared, being dissolved in\nthe eau hyliale (hyleal water) extracted from antimony and mercury sublimate, one\npart upon six, and cooked according to art and the doctrine of the Cosmopolite,]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=112\nPages: 112\nor a materia prima, that is a more or less solid primordial matter, secondly one that\nproposes a kind of metal juice, called Ghur or nobilis succus and thirdly the\nAristotelian exhalationes, rising moist vapours from the centre of the earth. One\nor more forming causes affect these primordial matters that all have the potentiality\nto be transformed, so that at one point this matter mutates into one of the known\nspecific metals, and consequently the different ore-deposits were formed. For\nexample, in his Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein Ru\u0308lein of Calw mentions mineral vapours, remotely\nreminiscent of Aristotle and Albertus, that rise as evaporation from the inner earth\nand condense to form ore deposits in the corridors and chasms of the mountains. He\nthen changes direction and ties these exhalationes back to alchemical concepts:\nThe subordinated thing, the common matter of all metals is according to the opinion and\nfaith of the scholars sulphur and quicksilver. Several believe, that due to the orbit and]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=109\nPages: 109\nmetals.\nThe structure of the book and the line of his argumentation shows that Albertus\nat one point had to face the question of transmutation: if metals are formed from\nprimordial matter consisting of a mixture of the four elements, i.e. from a mixture of\nsulphur and mercury as substances in between the basic elements and the finished\nmetals, and if metals are constantly emerging as defined species, then this logically\nleads to a discussion of whether one metal can be transformed into another as the\nalchemists claim. Albertus does not totally dismiss the possibility of transmutation,\nbut\u2014as a follower of Aristotle\u2014accepts the theoretical possibility, without showing particular interest in this question, when he states:\nWe do not intend here to show how any one of these may be transmuted into another, or\nhow, by the remedy of that medicine the alchemists call the elixir, their diseases may be\ncured, or their occult properties made manifest, or conversely their manifest properties be]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=15\nPages: 15\nworked with the great alchemy like those masters who are engaged with precious and\nvaluable things, with silver and gold, and with similar metals. These masters can separate\nsilver and gold from other precious jewelry, and from other valuable colors which they can\nproduce. Now this master Berthold wanted to induce a golden coloration. For this he used\nsalpetre, sulphur, lead and oil. Then he put these ingredients in a container made of copper,\nwhich he sealed completely, exactly as it should be done, but when he put it on fire and the\ncontainer became hot, it burst into many pieces.19\nThe Feuerwerckbuch witnesses material production based on practical chemistry in\nterms borrowed from alchemical transmutation, or more precisely, the making of\ngold.

On the one hand, the (sometimes) metaphorical or codified language\nas well as the approximations stressed the arcane nature of these recipes and\ncontributed to their secrecy.

The inclusion of this definition in such an\nancient text is noteworthy, since it proves that some of the earliest authors already\nfocused their treatises only on metallurgical practices.\nConsequently, the last part of Isis\u2019s work lists five metallurgical recipes describing: (a) how to make mercury solid and mix it with lead; (b) how to prepare a white\ndyeing drug by which, according to the third recipe (c), an iron-copper alloy was\ntreated and dyed white (the same alloy is dyed yellow in the second part of the\nrecipe); (d) how to mix the substances prepared according to the first three recipes;\n(e) how to process a metallic body before dyeing it white.24 This section is\nconcluded by a more general statement according to which all the \u03bf\u03b9$ \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\n(treatments), the \u03b4\u03af\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (techniques for doubling the weight of gold or silver]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=181\nPages: 181\ninformation for those wishing to know more about the properties and potentialities\nof the precious metals.

From the\n1640s through the 1660s, a network of correspondents and collaborators that included\nseveral gold- and silversmiths linked three major urban centers\u2014Amsterdam, Paris,\nand London\u2014and freely crossed political, linguistic, social, and confessional boundaries.

The theory that celestial bodies\ninfluence and shape earthly substances is treated at the beginning of Ru\u0308lein of\nCalw\u2019s Bergb\u20ac\nuchlein:\nFor the formation and growth of ores an effector is required and a subordinated material or\nmatter, which is adapted to receive the effect.

It is possible that they were separating silver present\nas an impurity in the tin and/or the lead used in the process, although Moriaen\u2019s\nclaim to have eventually turned 27 % of the weight of the tin into silver is\nimplausible. In the end, the project for obtaining silver from tin seems not to\nhave fulfilled initial expectations given Moriaen\u2019s and Grill\u2019s subsequent financial\ndifficulties, even though (or perhaps because) Grill, according to one report, spent\n\u00a31,200 on it.20\nNevertheless, some initial success may stand behind the contract that Grill]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=85\nPages: 85\ndirection, rising to the far reaches of the sky; the longer the distance, the quicker it\nrises. So towards the vertical ducts of these experimental furnaces, the particles of\nfire would have to increase their impact speed on the mass of metal inside the fusion\nchamber. The short sentence below the drawing of the furnace, along with many\nother observations of the physical status of the four elements and other natural\nsubstances, enables us to reconstruct Leonardo\u2019s theory of matter as a sort of a\n\u2018Aristotelian corpuscolarism\u2019 and a kinetic theory of heat/fire in which the melting\nof metal or the dissolution of a substance by fire depends on the percussion of a flow\nof particles.30 This interpretation finds confirmation in several reverberatory furnace drawings made with bent surfaces to drive the flow of fire into the middle of\nthe fusion chamber (Codex Atlanticus, fol. 1103r, 548r, 580v, 82v) (Fig. 4).\n29]&quot;,&quot;[url_for_citation: https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=187\nPages: 187\nmuch-engaged in the art\u201d obtained some spirit of salt \u201cnot prepared by the common\nmethod\u201d from Helvetius\u2019s friend Johann Caspar Kno\u0308ttner, a cloth dyer (and apparently, another type of artisan employed in chymical work). Consistent with\nBorrichius\u2019s private diary\u2019s account of the event, Helvetius tells how Grill poured\nthis spirit of salt over some lead in a glazed vessel (\u201csuch as is used for preserves\nand confections\u201d) and after two weeks was delighted to see a silvery \u201cstar\u201d floating\nin the liquid\u2014perhaps some sort of crystalline concretion.

In the same way as the demons (or maybe under their influence)\nsome people tried to hide the books, to summarize them, and disperse their content\nby focusing only on specific topics.\nIn this respect, the last part of the Syriac passage is particularly relevant, since\nZosimus explains that some alchemists narrowed their inquiry to the methods for\ngilding silver. Whereas, the art called che\u0304meia, at least in its original form, included\na wider set of dyeing techniques that were applied to all kinds of metals in order to\ndye them different colours.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The book *Laboratories of Art* discusses the <strong>sulfur-mercury theory</strong> as part of early modern alchemical thinking on the formation of metals. This theory, rooted in Aristotelian ideas, posits that metals are composed of two primary elements: sulfur and mercury. These elements were believed to represent fire and water, respectively, with their interaction being responsible for the creation of various metals. This theory was highly influential in alchemical thought, where sulfur was associated with combustibility and mercury with fluidity.

<strong>Key Points from the Text</strong>:
1. <strong>Albertus Magnus</strong> adapted Aristotle’s concept of two exhalations: a dry fume (sulfur) and a moist vapor (mercury), which combine to form metals. This dualistic approach underpinned the theory of metallogenesis in alchemy ([page 108](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=108)).
2. <strong>Agricola</strong> critiqued both the Aristotelian vapor theory and the sulfur-mercury theory, offering an alternative explanation involving water and earthy matter absorbed by the Earth’s crust, which transforms into metal deposits ([pages 112-113](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=112)).
3. <strong>Goldsmiths and alchemists</strong> in early modern Europe both worked with sulfur and mercury as core substances for metal purification and transformation, emphasizing their importance in practical metallurgical processes ([pages 121-122](https://myaidrive.com/wztmG7jcHihx4NbqDVhzk4/Laboratories.pdf?pdfPage=121)).

This theory demonstrates the blending of natural philosophy and artisanal practices in alchemical circles, where theoretical frameworks informed practical experimentation.</div>

<strong>Historical Figures</strong>:
1. <strong>Aristotle</strong> (384–322 BCE) – His natural philosophy, particularly the idea of the four elements (earth, air, fire, water), deeply influenced alchemical theories of matter and transformation.
2. <strong>Albertus Magnus</strong> (c. 1190–1280) – Adapted Aristotle’s theories to explain the formation of metals through the interaction of sulfur and mercury.
3. <strong>Paracelsus</strong> (1493–1541) – Combined alchemy with medical knowledge, emphasizing the importance of chemical processes in natural philosophy.

---

<strong>Objects/Materials</strong>:
1. <strong>Quicksilver (Mercury)</strong> – Representing the fluid, transformative qualities of materials in natural philosophy.
2. <strong>Sulfur</strong> – Symbolizing combustibility and the essence of fire, key to the theory of material transformation.
3. <strong>Four Classical Elements</strong> – Earth, air, fire, and water were believed to make up all matter, shaping alchemical practices.

---

<strong>Processes</strong>:
1. <strong>Transmutation</strong> – The process of transforming one substance into another, such as base metals into gold, based on natural principles.
2. <strong>Sublimation</strong> – The transformation of a solid directly into a gas, believed to demonstrate the interaction of the four elements in nature.
3. <strong>Calcination</strong> – The heating of substances to remove impurities, a process reflecting the natural purification of materials.

### <strong>Slide Title: The Sulfur-Mercury Theory in Alchemy</strong>  

---

<strong>Historical Figures</strong>:
1. <strong>Jābir ibn Hayyān</strong> (c. 721–815) – One of the earliest proponents of the sulfur-mercury theory, which described metals as combinations of these two principles.
2. <strong>Albertus Magnus</strong> (c. 1190–1280) – Further developed the theory by adapting Aristotelian natural philosophy, associating sulfur with fire and mercury with fluidity.
3. <strong>Paracelsus</strong> (1493–1541) – Expanded the sulfur-mercury theory by introducing a third principle, salt, to represent solidity and stability in matter.

---

<strong>Objects/Materials</strong>:
1. <strong>Sulfur</strong> – Representing fire and the volatile, combustible aspects of matter in alchemy.
2. <strong>Mercury (Quicksilver)</strong> – Symbolizing fluidity, malleability, and the reflective nature of metals.
3. <strong>Lead</strong> – A common base metal used in alchemical transmutation, believed to be made of impure sulfur and mercury.

---

<strong>Processes</strong>:
1. <strong>Amalgamation</strong> – The process of combining mercury with other metals to transform or purify them, central to the sulfur-mercury theory.
2. <strong>Sublimation</strong> – A method of separating sulfur and mercury by heating, allowing alchemists to purify substances.
3. <strong>Coagulation</strong> – The process where sulfur and mercury were believed to unite, creating solid metals through natural chemical reactions.

---

<strong>Quote</strong>:  
&quot;The sulfur-mercury theory, foundational to alchemical thought, explained the formation of metals through the interaction of sulfur (fire) and mercury (water), representing the dynamic forces of nature.&quot;
