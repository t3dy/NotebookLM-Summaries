    <p>Here is a detailed summary table for the document provided, &quot;Turning Traditions Upside Down: Rethinking Giordano Bruno’s Enlightenment&quot;:</p><p><table><tr><th><strong>Section</strong></th><th><strong>Contents</strong></th><th><strong>Contributions</strong></th><th><strong>Challenges</strong></th><th><strong>Argument</strong></th><th><strong>Quotation</strong></th><th><strong>Sources</strong></th></tr><tr><td><strong>Preface</strong></td><td>Discusses the multifaceted character of Giordano Bruno, emphasizing his revolutionary ideas in philosophy, cosmology, and natural philosophy. Highlights his contributions to the debate on the freedom of thought.</td><td>Introduces Bruno as a transformative figure challenging traditional thought and integrating metaphysical, cosmological, and epistemological ideas into a cohesive framework.</td><td>Acknowledges how traditional depictions of Bruno often reduce him to clichés, underestimating his complex intellectual legacy.</td><td>Bruno’s works represent a radical intellectual endeavor to redefine cosmological and philosophical paradigms through his idea of an infinite universe and the deconstruction of traditional epistemology.</td><td>&quot;The tragedy of Bruno’s life and thought may be seen as a radical symbol of the human struggle for knowledge.&quot;</td><td>Includes foundational references to Copernican cosmology, Platonic traditions, and Renaissance natural philosophy.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Introduction</strong></td><td>Explores Bruno’s intellectual evolution, his rejection of Aristotelian scholasticism, and his vision of an infinite, centerless universe. It connects his philosophical principles with his personal trials and eventual martyrdom.</td><td>Highlights his systematic integration of traditions (Platonic, Epicurean, and Hermetic) into his novel epistemology and cosmology.</td><td>Recognizes the tension between Bruno&#x27;s philosophical innovations and the institutional opposition they encountered.</td><td>Bruno advocates for a metaphysical unity that reconciles opposites, promoting an ethical approach rooted in his cosmology of infinity and interconnectedness.</td><td>&quot;Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné of his time.&quot;</td><td>Foundational figures include Plato, Epicurus, Copernicus, and Renaissance thinkers like Nicholas of Cusa and Ficino.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Part 1: Epistemic Practices</strong></td><td>Examines Bruno&#x27;s methodological innovations, including his reinterpretation of epistemological principles, the role of mnemonics in metaphysics, and the idea of intellectual adaptability.</td><td>Demonstrates Bruno’s method of blending metaphysical reflection with practical cognitive strategies, such as &quot;thinking through images&quot; and &quot;default positions&quot; in epistemology.</td><td>Challenges static interpretations of philosophical systems, proposing instead a dynamic and recursive model of cognition and metaphysical inquiry.</td><td>Bruno&#x27;s epistemology emphasizes the adaptability of thought processes, viewing knowledge as inherently iterative and relational.</td><td>&quot;Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.&quot;</td><td>Includes specific analyses of &quot;De triplici minimo et mensura&quot; and &quot;De immenso et innumerabilibus.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Part 2: Natural Philosophy</strong></td><td>Focuses on Bruno’s cosmology, emphasizing his infinite universe containing innumerable planetary systems. Discusses his rejection of the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian cosmos and the implications of his theories for physics and metaphysics.</td><td>Establishes Bruno’s anticipation of modern scientific ideas, including relativity of motion and an infinite, homogeneous space governed by universal laws.</td><td>Addresses Bruno&#x27;s marginalization in scientific discourse despite his pioneering ideas, such as a proto-relativity of time and space.</td><td>Bruno rejects anthropocentrism, proposing a cosmological order without a fixed center or privileged perspective.</td><td>&quot;The infinite universe contains innumerable inhabited worlds... governed by the same principles.&quot;</td><td>Draws from Epicurean physics, Copernican heliocentrism, and Newtonian precursors.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Part 3: Literary Forms</strong></td><td>Explores Bruno’s innovative use of dialogue, satire, and paradox in his writings, emphasizing their role in disrupting conventional literary and philosophical norms.</td><td>Highlights Bruno’s blending of literary genres to critique epistemological dogmatism and convey complex metaphysical ideas.</td><td>Argues that Bruno’s use of paradox and satire made his works less accessible and prone to misinterpretation by contemporaries and modern readers.</td><td>Bruno’s literary innovations reflect his commitment to challenging the reader&#x27;s expectations and inviting active intellectual engagement.</td><td>&quot;The form of Bruno’s texts determines their meaning.&quot;</td><td>Includes references to &quot;Candelaio&quot; and &quot;Cabala del cavallo pegaseo.&quot;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Part 4: Reception and Afterlife</strong></td><td>Examines Bruno’s intellectual legacy, focusing on his influence in Catholic Europe during the Counter-Reformation and his later reception in literature, philosophy, and the arts.</td><td>Demonstrates the evolving interpretation of Bruno as a heretic, scientist, and cultural icon.</td><td>Reflects on how Bruno’s ideas were selectively appropriated or censored, particularly by Jesuit scholars like Athanasius Kircher.</td><td>Bruno&#x27;s reception history underscores the enduring relevance and contested nature of his thought across different intellectual and cultural contexts.</td><td>&quot;Bruno has been received in literature and art as well as in public spaces in a way that has been as versatile as the philosopher himself.&quot;</td><td>Includes sources on Jesuit scholarship, modern scientific reception, and literary reinterpretations of Bruno.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Part 5: Monument to Bruno</strong></td><td>Discusses the symbolic significance of the Giordano Bruno monument in Berlin and its representation of Bruno’s legacy as a martyr for intellectual freedom and cosmological inquiry.</td><td>Frames the monument as a modern homage to Bruno’s struggle against orthodoxy and his vision of intellectual liberation.</td><td>Raises questions about the role of public art in shaping collective memory of historical figures like Bruno.</td><td>The monument serves as a metaphor for Bruno’s challenge to overturn intellectual and social hierarchies, reflecting his defiance of conformity.</td><td>&quot;The statue depicts the vulnerable body of a philosopher who is turning the world upside-down.&quot;</td><td>Includes Alexander Polzin&#x27;s interpretations and historical accounts of Bruno’s influence on public thought.</td></tr></table></p><p>This table encapsulates the major themes and arguments of the text while highlighting its scholarly contributions and challenges.

    <p>Here’s a table summarizing the ideas from John R. Searle and cognitive science mentioned in the study, as extracted from the document:</p><p><table><tr><th><strong>Concept/Idea</strong></th><th><strong>Explanation</strong></th><th><strong>Connection to Bruno</strong></th><th><strong>Cognitive Science Context</strong></th></tr><tr><td><strong>Default Positions</strong></td><td>Default positions are mental frameworks or assumptions that facilitate cognitive processes, akin to preset software configurations.</td><td>Bruno critiques static defaults in epistemology, advocating for a &quot;meta-operation&quot; to adapt and challenge mental models as needed.</td><td>Searle describes default positions as tools for cognition, which are practical but can restrict thought when unexamined or unaltered.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Meta-Operation</strong></td><td>A higher-order cognitive process that modifies the default settings to adapt to new or exceptional contexts.</td><td>Bruno’s philosophy involves rethinking fundamental assumptions, such as cosmological and epistemological frameworks, to embrace the infinite.</td><td>Meta-operations reflect cognitive flexibility, an advanced capability in problem-solving and creative thinking.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Interaction of Prejudices</strong></td><td>Prejudices (default positions) can be temporary and functional but become problematic when rigidly held, obstructing intellectual progress.</td><td>Bruno’s work dismantles entrenched defaults like the geocentric universe, illustrating the necessity of questioning ingrained beliefs.</td><td>Cognitive science examines biases and heuristics as efficient but occasionally limiting strategies for navigating complex environments.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cognition as Relational</strong></td><td>Knowledge is shaped by the interaction between experience, perception, and underlying assumptions.</td><td>Bruno connects the observer’s perspective to cosmological structures, emphasizing that the universe has no fixed center or hierarchy.</td><td>Relational models in cognitive science emphasize the interplay between perception, context, and cognition in constructing knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Infinity and Perception</strong></td><td>Human perception is limited by its defaults (e.g., Earth as the center), but rethinking these enables recognition of infinite possibilities.</td><td>Bruno challenges sensory reliance and static epistemologies to propose a unified, infinite universe beyond anthropocentric limitations.</td><td>Cognitive models address the role of sensory limitations and cognitive adaptation in expanding human understanding of complex phenomena.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mind-World Analogy</strong></td><td>The analogy of the mind as a mirror to the world reflects how cognition attempts to represent external realities, often imperfectly.</td><td>Bruno’s epistemology suggests that the infinite nature of the universe can only be approximated through evolving, iterative thought processes.</td><td>Mirrors cognitive theories of representation, where mental models attempt to simulate or map external realities within inherent constraints.</td></tr></table></p><p>This table distills how Searle’s concepts and broader cognitive science principles were interpreted and applied in the study, particularly in the context of Giordano Bruno’s epistemological framework.

This theme is important to Bruno, who symptomatically picks it up<br>
again in the poem at the beginning of the Explicatio triginta sigillorum and<br>
“intimates his hope for the advent of a ‘mythical’ age when the world, wise<br>
at last, though late (sero sapiens), will see ignorance and hostile prejudices<br>

that, for a long time, has been counted amongst the mnemotechnical works<br>
and implicitly dismissed due to an obsolete idea of Renaissance culture<br>
and philosophy. However, we must drop this misinterpretation if we want<br>
to understand Bruno’s theories, in this particular text and in general.</p><p>This text, in fact, has strong philosophical caliber and is perhaps one of<br>
the most relevant in Bruno’s œuvre. Yet, due to its composite structure, it<br>
also has the important merit of taking us straight into Bruno’s ‘workshop,’<br>
allowing us to both understand the manner in which his texts must be deci-<br>
phered in general and to define (or confirm) at least four specific points.<br>
These include the articulated theoretical basis of his ars, which tackles a<br>
number of gnosiologial, ontological, and ethical issues, evenly introducing<br>
them into the frame of the nova filosofia; the fact that ethico-political and<br>
religious issues are already established in his mnemotechnical works and<br>
destined to find a fuller development in the Spaccio (where the contro -<br>
versy against Puritans becomes central as much as vehement); the possi-<br>
bility, as a consequence, of dating the genesis of Bruno’s first conception<br>
of the Spaccio to the last period of his stay in Paris, though in the frame of<br>
a polemic that, in the Sigillus, is aimed against Protestants as well as<br>
against monastic orders; and, last but not least, the text allows us to figure<br>
out Bruno’s modus operandi.</p><p>Yet, one needs not exaggerate the relation between the Sigillus and the<br>
Spaccio. The persistency of these topics, even if in a short time span,<br>
attests to the continuity of some main themes and also to the incessant<br>
revision to which Bruno subjected his works.<br>

A few examples: In the Cantus Circaeus, the combination of ars memo-<br>
riae and renovatio mundi is displayed as a sort of theatrical representation<br>
in an extremely evocative and effective way. Yet this connection operates<br>
in the Sigillus sigillorum as well, in the frame of an interconnection between<br>
mnemotechnics, ethics, and apocalyptic aspects, and this represents one of<br>
the most advanced points of Bruno’s historical-philosophical meditation.<br>
After a thorough criticism of Protestants (who try to “push the poisoned<br>
people back into the old barbarity” and to “divert them from the object to<br>
which they are directed by all the laws”), Bruno concludes his examination<br>
of the first kind of contraction by powerfully combining the motif of the<br>
‘apocalypse’ and that of renovatio. The ‘time of antidotes’ will come after<br>
the ‘time of poisons’ and the “world, finally made wise by its own evil sick-<br>
ness, will resolve to exterminate and eliminate them as if they were the<br>
dar nel, caterpillar, and locusts of this age, or better still, like vipers and scor -<br>
pions, and to castrate those who rejoice in idleness, avarice and ambition.”33</p><p>This theme is important to Bruno, who symptomatically picks it up<br>
again in the poem at the beginning of the Explicatio triginta sigillorum and<br>
“intimates his hope for the advent of a ‘mythical’ age when the world, wise<br>
at last, though late (sero sapiens), will see ignorance and hostile prejudices<br>

3</p><p>In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary<br>
thinking upside down, and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as<br>
the theoretical consequences of his thought, the contributions of this vol-<br>
ume all start from a selected text, an exemplary passage drawn from Bru -<br>
no’s great range of work or from texts close to his person and œuvre. Pre -<br>
senting and elucidating pivotal points of the philosophia nolana, the essays<br>
both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy and<br>
provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual<br>
reflections that will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s<br>
works. They reconstruct Bruno’s deconstruction and rearrangement of<br>
phi  lo  sophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his<br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They<br>
ex plore the topics and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and<br>
point out the variance of his reception up to the present, both inside and<br>
outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and continuing<br>
fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>The results of the contributor’s investigations are presented in four sec-<br>
tions, according to four main fields of research interest. The first section<br>
entitled Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary: Bruno’s Methods and Thin -<br>
king, examines Bruno’s methodological procedures. The essays show how<br>
the Nolan undermined traditional positions, by a subtle reflexion on epis-<br>
temological principles, logical structures, or metaphysical presuppositions,<br>
to secure evidence for his philosophy of the infinite and its inherent con-<br>
sequences which revolutionized the fields of metaphysics and epistemolo-<br>
gy, physics, cosmology and anthropology. Bruno’s method of appropriat-<br>
ing and concatenating older philosophical concepts appears to be both a<br>
method of critical revision as well as systematic transformation.</p><p>Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>

anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.</p><p>Wolfgang Neuser presents an alternative interpretation of Bruno’s the-<br>
ory of matter. Against the backdrop of the controversial medieval debates<br>
about atomism concerning the attributes or qualities of atoms, their cor-<br>
puscular or essential substantiality, and the appreciation of them as dis-<br>
tinct particles, Bruno develops an understanding of matter that merges the<br>
Aristotelian concept of substance with atomistic ideas and the Neo-Pla -<br>
tonic concept of matter, according to which matter is filled with spirit.<br>
Bruno differentiates three manifestations of the metaphysical monad, i.e.,<br>
the undivided, infinite unum that systematically underlies everything.<br>
These manifestations are the constituents of matter: spiritus, based on the<br>
neo-Platonic concept of a spiritual virtue inherent in all matter; spatium,<br>
or the structural explication of the indivisible, un-extended point, which<br>
emerges in a process of self-generation; and atomus, the smallest indivisi-<br>
ble or the physical minimum. Spirit, space, and atom are the structural<br>
modes of the expansion of infinite unity. Based on this conceptualisation<br>
of matter, Neuser characterizes Bruno as a Renaissance philosopher who,<br>
at the end of the post-traditional stage in history, anticipates the subject-<br>
based foundation of knowledge, representative for thinkers from the Mo -<br>
dern Age like Descartes, Spinoza or Leibniz. </p><p>Enrico Giannetto’s chapter emphasizes no less than the astonishing fact<br>
that Giordano Bruno—notwithstanding the significant differences in theo-<br>
retical premises—presents a theory of relativity of time and motion three<br>
hundred years before Poincaré and Einstein. While his non-mechanistic<br>
conception of nature was an obstacle in recognizing Bruno as a serious sci-<br>
entist, according to Giannetto, Bruno’s importance within the history of<br>
theoretical physics is irrefutable. He argues that the relativity of time is<br>
one consequence of Bruno’s concept of cosmic infinity, also entailing the<br>
relativity of the localisation of planets or stars and of their motion, rota-<br>
tion and orbits within a uniform space. Rejecting the Aristotelian assump-<br>
tion of a primum mobile, Bruno argues for the plurality of incommensu-<br>
rable times due to the infinity of uniform motions within the universe.<br>
Turning the Aristotelian doctrine upside down, Bruno regards (relative)<br>
motion as the measure of time.</p><p>Arcangelo Rossi, comparing the cosmological theories of Copernicus,<br>
Bruno, and Galilei, attests a striking correspondence between the Nolan<br>
and the Galilean doctrines. Like Giannetto, Rossi aims at restoring Bru -</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 6</p><p>7<br>

in the history of ideas. As a great scholar, celebrated for his comprehen-<br>

against religious doctrine and his rigid attacks against reputed authorities,<br>
he caused an intellectual stir wherever he went. Sometimes his interventi -<br>
ons were received with great éclat; more often, however, they created aca -<br>
de mic scandal. Bruno impressed the French King Henri III who made him<br>
one of his “lecteurs royaux”; three years later, he had to leave Paris in<br>
tumultuous circumstances after a disputation had grown out of control. In<br>
the meantime, Bruno had upset the intellectual scene in Elizabethan<br>
England with his six Italian dialogues. Moving between different frontiers,<br>
confessional beliefs, philosophical schools, academic parties and institu-<br>
tional interests, Bruno—who did not mince matters—came under attack<br>
from many sides. </p><p>Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné<br>
of his time, the Scholastic Aristotelian philosophy that presented a view of<br>
man and cosmos, which Bruno had been dissatisfied with since his time in a<br>
Dominican convent in Naples. For his project of philosophical reform, Bruno<br>
draws on a large variety of sources: on Platonic, pre-Socratic, Py tha   gorean,<br>
and Hermetic ideas, on thinkers such as Plotinus, Averroes, Nicholas of<br>
Cusa, Raimundus Lullus and Ficino. He builds on the metho do  logy, flour-<br>

This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to<br>
have worked on Giordano Bruno and his epoch. Their contributions—<br>
inspired by a colloquium on Giordano Bruno organized by the Max Planck<br>
Institute for the History of Science and the Central European University<br>
in 2008—represent a critical inventory of our knowledge of the Nolan’s life<br>
and work as well as shedding light on the many dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
thinking. His radical rationality, starting with attempts to reinvent the<br>
roots of religion but ending with a break in the doctrines of trinity and<br>
monotheism; his natural philosophy, including the cosmology of the infini-<br>
ty of the universe and of the unlimited number of worlds, or his thinking<br>
on the vital character of all the objects on earth; his vision of a new cosmic<br>
order and his place in the Copernican revolution, breaking with the domi-<br>
nant heliocentric and anthropocentric system in a way more radical than<br>
any contemporary thinker had before; his scientific methods, his analogies,<br>
speculations, metaphors, his intuitive as well as practical knowledge,<br>
reflecting the epistemic practices of a revolutionary; his idiosyncratic<br>
blending of traditions, both philosophical and literary; his linguistic exu-<br>
berance and conceptual boldness; the textual structures, genres, and forms<br>
of non-conformity Bruno continuously experimented with, from the trac-<br>
tate to comedy, from dialogue to poetry; and finally, his gusto for paradox<br>
and satirical panache. Attention has also to be given to Bruno’s consider-<br>
ation of the role of philosophy in society—either as a way to give coher-<br>
ence to a world thrown off track, or simply as an instrument for civilizing</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal vii</p><p>viii Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>mankind. This leads us to the reflection and the reception of Bruno’s intel-<br>

The last section of the book, Visibility of the Invisible: About the Sculpture<br>
Giordano Bruno by Alexander Polzin [2008], is dedicated to the statue of<br>
Giordano Bruno that was recently erected in Berlin. Besides a description<br>
of the statue and its pendants at Nola and Budapest made by the sculptor,<br>
Alexander Polzin, himself, the author Durs Grünbein gives a poet’s inter-<br>
pretation of the statue at the moment of its unveiling at Potsdamer Platz. He<br>
construes the heretic as an emblematic figure of a young, independent<br>
Europe and asks himself why Berlin—a city which Bruno, this great tra -<br>
veller, has never been to—and, specifically, an underground station could be</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 9</p><p>the right place to commemorate the philosopher from Nola. For Grün bein,<br>
the statue is an iconographic alarm signal, visualizing a rhetoric of fire, the<br>
language of alchemy and metamorphoses that characterizes Bruno’s think-<br>
ing. Finally, Grünbein brings thinkers and poets together in a virtual con-<br>
versation across time and space: Bruno, Nietzsche, Scho pen hau er, and<br>
Czesław Miłosz.</p><p>Anything but virtual were the exchanges we—philosophers, historians, and<br>
literary scholars—had about Giordano Bruno in the congenial and inspiring<br>
atmosphere of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin,<br>

There are two passages worth mentioning to delineate the results of<br>
Bruno’s meditation on the ars. In one of his most mature reflections,<br>
Bruno, echoing a Platonic theme, writes: “These ‘furori’ we are reasoning<br>
about […] are not an oblivion, but a memory; are not self-negligence, but<br>
love and longing for good and beauty, by which we may transform and<br>
become perfect.”16 Still, this interpretation of ‘furore’ as ‘memory’ and not<br>
‘oblivion’ (if we want to escape from a condition of servitude and passi vity,</p><p>“…per speculum et in aenigmate…”</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 43</p><p>44 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>even when we are possessed by the ‘divine spirit’) has its roots precisely in<br>
Bruno’s works of 1582 and 1583. Bruno explicitly refers to them and then<br>
defines the general theoretical view in which his interpretation of ‘furore’<br>
must be considered. In another emblematic text, Bruno delineates the<br>
twofold way to truth disclosed to man, taking into consideration the “dis-<br>
proportion of our cognitive means to the cognizable.” “In order to con-<br>
template divine things,” says Bruno, “we must open our eyes via figures,<br>
semblances, and other reasons that the Peripatetics collect under the name<br>
of ‘phantasmata,’ or, through being, proceed to the speculation of the<br>
essence, from the effects to the knowledge of the cause.”17 It is perfectly<br>
clear to Bruno that, due to this ‘disproportion,’ this second way is pre-<br>
cluded: “These means, far from being useful for the accomplishment of<br>
this purpose, are rather obstacles, if we maintain that the highest and<br>
deepest cognition of divine things takes place through negation, and not<br>
through affirmation, knowing that the divine beauty and goodness does<br>
not and cannot fall under our concepts but is beyond and beyond incom-<br>
prehensible; particularly in this condition, called ‘speculator of phantas-<br>
mata’ by philosophers and ‘vision through secular similitude and enigma’<br>
by theologians, because,” he concludes, “we do not truly see the effects<br>
and the real species of things, or the substance of ideas, but the shadows,<br>
vestiges and simulacra of ideas, like those who are in the cave and, from<br>
their birth, turn their backs to the point of entrance of light and their faces<br>
to the bottom of the cavern, where they do not see what really exists, but<br>
only the shadows of what substantially exists outside the cave.”18</p><p>Commenting on this passage, Tocco stresses in the Furori that Bruno<br>
“goes back to the philosophical views of De umbris” and is more a disciple<br>
of Plotinus than of Plato.19 Gentile quotes this assertion without com-<br>
ments, embracing the interpretation of his Florentine magister. Yet, this is<br>
a general problem, not confined to a matter concerning sources (although<br>
Tocco was inclined to stress the Plotinian influence in the light of his vision<br>
of the development of Bruno’s thought).<br>

Nolan.” Deconstructing the relationship between God and the outside world gave distinction to <br>
his life—and his refusal to recant when facing the stake somehow set him apart from the world. <br>
Since then, the debate about the Nolan has been dominated by the interest in the comprehensive <br>
oeuvre of the philosopher, and by attempts to make him a protagonist of the freedom of thought.<br>

These positions shed light on another key-point of Bruno’s meditation:<br>
In the relationship between God and the universe, he is interested in the<br>
latter, in the ‘image,’ the ‘portrait,’ the ‘vestige,’ the ‘effect,’ and not in the<br>
‘cause.’ Bruno has no special interest in the dimension of divinity per se.<br>
He is instead looking for the ‘punto de l’unione’ and reflecting on the<br>
forms of ‘mediation’ from a specific perspective: He consistently focuses<br>
on the universe, the ‘effect’. It is exactly on these grounds that Bruno<br>
emphasizes, to a greater extent, the specific ontological function of images<br>
in a context that leads him in De imaginum compositione (with a consider-<br>
able shift in his theory) to intertwine his studies of mnemotechnics and<br>
magic. Both are essential factors in a true ‘theory of being’ that is specifi-<br>
cally aimed at analyzing the ‘explicated,’ the ‘dispersed,’ the ‘universe,’ (or<br>
whatever must be brought back to unity in order to be ‘apprehended’),<br>
forcing the ‘limits’ of man to the highest degree.</p><p>Considering all this, it is easy to realize the inadequacy of the ‘tran-<br>
scendent’ interpretation of Bruno’s thought: the iter that he follows, on all<br>
levels, is precisely the opposite. If man’s main objective were God, or a<br>
proper meditation on God, he would not take a step forward in the quest</p><p>“…per speculum et in aenigmate…”</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 47</p><p>48 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>for truth, which is within his reach if he is able to understand the system-<br>
atic and unavoidable connection between ‘truth’ and ‘image.’ He must<br>
analyze it in the different fields on which he concentrates (including, as we<br>
have already mentioned, the dimension of magic, which fits this funda-<br>
mental theoretical frame as demonstrated by all the Brunian works, from<br>
the Spaccio de la bestia trionfante to the magic works stricto sensu).<br>

Bruno is particularly attentive to the technical dimension of his ars, to<br>
its ‘scientific’ (and consequently demonstrable and teachable) character.<br>
As we mentioned before, his works often originated as drafts for public<br>
and private lessons, but are defined by the theoretical foundation (i.e., the<br>
theory of being) on which they are based. A technique, indeed, but also a<br>
philosophically-grounded technique able, as such, to overwhelm and van-<br>
quish traditional artes. Using a ‘seal’ dear to Bruno, we could say that the<br>
theory is the ‘tree’ from which stem the branches of the ars that, at the<br>
same time, bestows meaning on the ars and gives it its roots.</p><p>“…per speculum et in aenigmate…”</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:08  Oldal 55</p><p>56 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>We read in the commentary on the Explicatio that: “It is not enough to<br>
use the different seals (that is, the mnemotechnical expedients suggested<br>
by them) in order to organize the mnemonic material according to specific<br>
modalities; it is necessary to understand their functioning in depth, and<br>
comprehend the ‘mechanisms’ which animate them, so as to figure out<br>
their ‘formula,’ namely the technical and theoretical principles on which<br>
they are based.”45</p><p>This is the reason why it is possible, or rather unavoidable, when read-<br>
ing the mnemotechnical works, to come upon the structural constituents of<br>
the nova filosofia, which are also the founding principles of Bruno’s theo-<br>
ry on mnemotechnics (from the vision of shadow to that of natural vicissi-<br>
tude and universal metamorphosis; from the idea of the mutual connection<br>
of each thing to each other thing to that of the structural and bi-univocal<br>
relation between the infinite plasticity and changeability of the ‘fantastic’<br>
potency and matter, and the ordinative, yet creative, power of the intel-<br>
lect;46 from the relation between the natural ‘unity’ and the ‘innumerable<br>
differences,’ which we have to master—as he explains in his magical texts),<br>
if we want to establish a truly functioning ars, able to decipher and see into<br>
the structure of reality, and understand the ‘principles’ that determine its<br>
infinite transformations.47 In this context, Bruno’s strong encyclopedic<br>
interests—revolving around the principles of order, proportion, interde-<br>
pendence, and regularity—should not be neglected, as they are interests<br>
that lead him to deal with the theories of the Lullian tradition that inter-<br>
laced, in an innovative and fruitful way, mnemotechnics and the combina-<br>
tory (in Bruno’s vision, the art of Lull is aimed precisely at achieving a<br>
complexity of effects that imitates the manifold and perpetual course of<br>
natural becoming).48<br>

This text, in fact, has strong philosophical caliber and is perhaps one of<br>
the most relevant in Bruno’s œuvre. Yet, due to its composite structure, it<br>
also has the important merit of taking us straight into Bruno’s ‘workshop,’<br>
allowing us to both understand the manner in which his texts must be deci-<br>
phered in general and to define (or confirm) at least four specific points.<br>
These include the articulated theoretical basis of his ars, which tackles a<br>
number of gnosiologial, ontological, and ethical issues, evenly introducing<br>
them into the frame of the nova filosofia; the fact that ethico-political and<br>
religious issues are already established in his mnemotechnical works and<br>
destined to find a fuller development in the Spaccio (where the contro -<br>
versy against Puritans becomes central as much as vehement); the possi-<br>
bility, as a consequence, of dating the genesis of Bruno’s first conception<br>
of the Spaccio to the last period of his stay in Paris, though in the frame of<br>
a polemic that, in the Sigillus, is aimed against Protestants as well as<br>
against monastic orders; and, last but not least, the text allows us to figure<br>
out Bruno’s modus operandi.</p><p>Yet, one needs not exaggerate the relation between the Sigillus and the<br>
Spaccio. The persistency of these topics, even if in a short time span,<br>
attests to the continuity of some main themes and also to the incessant<br>
revision to which Bruno subjected his works.</p><p>One must not stop at this consideration, however important it may be.<br>
The original ‘secret’ of Bruno’s mind lies in the perpetual interlacing—in<br>
changing virtually infinite shapes—of the original ‘cells’ of his thought, as<br>
exemplified in his mnemotechnical works. Without an understanding of<br>
this ‘movement’ and its pattern, it is impossible to understand the strictly<br>
systematizing function of the main constituents of the nova filosofia, and<br>
the variations they are subjected to, as well as the following central theo-</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 50</p><p>51</p><p>retical point: the paradigm of the ars memoriae directly reflects Bruno’s<br>
way of thinking and operating. In other words, the ars memoriae is funda-<br>
mental, but also something more than a generative source of the nova<br>
filosofia: it is the form of Bruno’s mind itself, the ‘structure’ through which<br>
his mind finds expression. By understanding the ars, therefore, it is possi-<br>
ble to decipher the functioning of his mind. Consequently, the ‘continuity’<br>
between the Sigillus and the Spaccio previously referred to is not an excep-<br>
tion; it is in fact the rule. Bruno’s mind follows a spiral rather than a<br>
straight line—a ‘metaphysical’ rather than a ‘physical movement’ (to use a<br>
noteworthy distinction made, symptomatically, in the Furori,35 where it is<br>
also possible to catch an autobiographical allusion).<br>

Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.</p><p>In his essay “…per speculum et in aenigmate…,” Michele Ciliberto dis-<br>
plays how “thinking through images” is the central point in Bruno’s nova<br>
filosofia. It is the topic not only of his meditations on the ars memoriae, but<br>
is continuously discussed both in his Italian as well as in his later Latin<br>
works. For Bruno, the use of images is a condition preceding every act of<br>
thinking. This leads him to a new conceptualisation of the process of cog-<br>
nition: Images or mental phantastic figures are like an interface between<br>
mind and nature, between the logical, abstract operations and the innu-<br>
merable appearances of the visible world. At the same time, the inex-<br>
haustible potency of fantasy to produce images makes us aware of the idea<br>
of infinity. In this context, the dialectic between fantasy and intellect,<br>
abstract synthesis and creative analysis is, as Ciliberto points out, vitally<br>
important: it shows the way of man’s approximation to the eternal truth,<br>
an infinite itinerarium, i.e., a metaphysical movement of man who by<br>
descending into himself tries to know the One, a way which allows him to<br>
touch the divine cause indirectly “through the mirror and in enigma.” </p><p>Following this, Anne Eusterschulte attempts to delineate Bruno’s assi -<br>
milation of heterogeneous elements of ancient philosophy and shows how,</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 4</p><p>5<br>

his life—and his refusal to recant when facing the stake somehow set him apart from the world. <br>

Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné<br>
of his time, the Scholastic Aristotelian philosophy that presented a view of<br>
man and cosmos, which Bruno had been dissatisfied with since his time in a<br>
Dominican convent in Naples. For his project of philosophical reform, Bruno<br>
draws on a large variety of sources: on Platonic, pre-Socratic, Py tha   gorean,<br>
and Hermetic ideas, on thinkers such as Plotinus, Averroes, Nicholas of<br>
Cusa, Raimundus Lullus and Ficino. He builds on the metho do  logy, flour-<br>
ishing during the Renaissance, of mnemotechnics. And he uses all these</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 1</p><p>2 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>traditions in a highly original, idiosyncratic way. In ven tively blending “ars<br>
lulliana” and “ars memoriae,” Bruno introduces combinatory elements<br>
into the art of memory and refines it into an epistemology which, at the<br>
same time, is an ontology. For he postulates the analogy of mind and<br>
world, being and thought—an analogy which he ultimately sees as a unity.<br>
This idea of unity leads to the concept of the metaphysical One, central to<br>
Bruno’s philosophy: a unity preceding all differences, prior even to the<br>
Aristotelian principles of form and matter, and therefore unintelligible, at<br>
least in any direct way, to a singular being like man. As the One is the ori-<br>
gin of all realities and all possibilities, it is directly linked to the second<br>
concept central to Bruno: infinity. Infinity is the key concept in Bruno’s<br>
cosmology, discarding its Aristotelian-Ptolemaic predecessor, which was<br>
constructed in a closed and carefully graduated hierarchy of spheres<br>
around the Earth. Based on Copernicus’ heliocentric system, Bru no pos -<br>
tu lates an unlimited, infinite universe containing innumerable inhabited<br>
worlds, all made of the same matter, all of the same importance, and moving<br>
in a homogeneous space, following the same governing principle. However,<br>
not only does Bruno formulate the metaphysics of an infinite universe, he<br>
also reflects the anthropological consequences of such a cosmology; for it<br>
is clear that, in Bruno’s universe, there is no place for the idea of a per-<br>
sonal creator god. Accordingly, he attempts to formulate a new ethics—an<br>
ethics that, propounding a metaphysically “heroic life,” simultaneously<br>
opens a way to approximate cognition of the One.</p><p>Right from the beginning, Bruno was an “academico di nulla aca de mia,”<br>
an “academic of no academy,” as he calls himself in his comedy Candle-<br>
bearer. Soon enough, he became not only institutionally, but literally home-<br>
less, wandering from Italy to France, to England, to Germany and back<br>
again over the Alps, watched by suspicious eyes because of his radical visi -<br>
ons of intellectual reform. At last the prominent “universally learned man<br>
who did not, however, have any religion,” as one contemporary de scribed<br>
him, fell victim to denunciation in Venice and, after a nearly eight-year-<br>
long trial, was condemned by the Roman inquisition to be burnt at the<br>
stake. The verdict was executed on the Campo de’ Fiori in Rome, on Feb -<br>
ruary 17, 1600. The stench of burnt flesh is said to have lingered for days.<br>

analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.<br>

It is in this context that Warburg acquired, with the aid of Leonardo<br>
Olschki, a Library of Brunian studies that was initially assembled by<br>
Virgilio Salvestrini (1873–1954).29 Salvestrini was a studious bookseller<br>
whose shop, on Via XXIX Maggio, in front of the University of Pisa, was<br>
frequented by students and professors.30 The Salvestrini books—150 titles</p><p>From Paris to Rome, Hamburg and London</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:09  Oldal 243</p><p>244 Reflections of an Intellectual Burning</p><p>of which are now available online—include the main nineteenth-century<br>
editions of the complete works, as well as the principal studies on the<br>
philosopher’s life and thought. Salvestrini also collected various pamphlets<br>
and occasional papers echoing the intense controversies surrounding the<br>
erection of the Campo de’ Fiori monument, unveiled on June 9, 1889.</p><p>Warburg died before he could make use of this freshly acquired mate-<br>
rial and complete these projects. The remains are sparse notes in the K.B.W.<br>
Tagebuch which he took to Italy, as well as a folder entitled “Giordano<br>
Bruno,” kept in the Warburg Institute archive, which contains some leaves<br>
of notes and sketches.31 After the migration of the Warburg Institute to<br>
England in 1933, the library continued acquiring Bruno material, especial-<br>
ly from the late 1940s onwards when Frances A. Yates, who had already<br>
encountered the philosopher in her John Florio (1934), began the research<br>
that would produce her two most influential books: Giordano Bruno and<br>
the Hermetic Tradition (1964) and The Art of Memory (1966).</p><p>Frances A. Yates’s intellectual program intersected rather than merged<br>
with Warburg’s own orientations. Even if one of the main thrusts of her<br>
research on the Hermetic tradition aimed at showing the irrational magi-<br>

philosophical questions which occupied Warburg. She saw herself as a cul-<br>
tural historian, and her inner certitudes seem to have leaned towards mys-<br>
ticism.32 When she wrote histories—be they histories of the hermetic<br>
traditi on or the art of memory—the Renaissance and early Baroque periods,<br>
rather than the present, were her points of departure. Frances A. Yates’s<br>
studies on Giordano Bruno—and, in particular, his mnemonic works—<br>
were indebted to Warburg’s posthumous influence, as much as to the Bru -<br>
nian pre sence brought about by the Salvestrini books. Her research,<br>
never theless, led her to propose a radically different image of Bruno, as a<br>

modernity. </p><p>Now, the impact of Yates’s vision of Bruno as a Renaissance magus is<br>

anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.</p><p>Wolfgang Neuser presents an alternative interpretation of Bruno’s the-<br>
ory of matter. Against the backdrop of the controversial medieval debates<br>
about atomism concerning the attributes or qualities of atoms, their cor-<br>
puscular or essential substantiality, and the appreciation of them as dis-<br>
tinct particles, Bruno develops an understanding of matter that merges the<br>
Aristotelian concept of substance with atomistic ideas and the Neo-Pla -<br>
tonic concept of matter, according to which matter is filled with spirit.<br>
Bruno differentiates three manifestations of the metaphysical monad, i.e.,<br>
the undivided, infinite unum that systematically underlies everything.<br>
These manifestations are the constituents of matter: spiritus, based on the<br>
neo-Platonic concept of a spiritual virtue inherent in all matter; spatium,<br>
or the structural explication of the indivisible, un-extended point, which<br>
emerges in a process of self-generation; and atomus, the smallest indivisi-<br>
ble or the physical minimum. Spirit, space, and atom are the structural<br>
modes of the expansion of infinite unity. Based on this conceptualisation<br>
of matter, Neuser characterizes Bruno as a Renaissance philosopher who,<br>
at the end of the post-traditional stage in history, anticipates the subject-<br>
based foundation of knowledge, representative for thinkers from the Mo -<br>
dern Age like Descartes, Spinoza or Leibniz. </p><p>Enrico Giannetto’s chapter emphasizes no less than the astonishing fact<br>
that Giordano Bruno—notwithstanding the significant differences in theo-<br>
retical premises—presents a theory of relativity of time and motion three<br>
hundred years before Poincaré and Einstein. While his non-mechanistic<br>
conception of nature was an obstacle in recognizing Bruno as a serious sci-<br>
entist, according to Giannetto, Bruno’s importance within the history of<br>
theoretical physics is irrefutable. He argues that the relativity of time is<br>
one consequence of Bruno’s concept of cosmic infinity, also entailing the<br>
relativity of the localisation of planets or stars and of their motion, rota-<br>
tion and orbits within a uniform space. Rejecting the Aristotelian assump-<br>
tion of a primum mobile, Bruno argues for the plurality of incommensu-<br>
rable times due to the infinity of uniform motions within the universe.<br>

motion as the measure of time.</p><p>Arcangelo Rossi, comparing the cosmological theories of Copernicus,<br>
Bruno, and Galilei, attests a striking correspondence between the Nolan<br>

The following days are characterized by feverish activities. He reports<br>
that Ernst Steinmann wants him to lecture in the large hall of the Hert zi -<br>
ana. He accepts, but insists on using pin boards with photographs, not<br>
slides. He has reached a crossroad “where the attempt by the historian of<br>
pure thought meets the attempt by the historian of pure un-reason” in<br>
Giordano Bruno. Bruno’s “strange ambivalence” has become clear to him<br>
only now. He has to travel to Naples and Nola […], wants to give a lecture<br>
on Bruno as a thinker in images, and adds that, without Gertrud Bing’s<br>
assistance, he would never have been able to proceed with his research, the<br>
result of which is the “Kulturwissenschaftlicher Typen Atlas.”28</p><p>His projected essay approached Bruno not as a wandering knight, but as<br>
Perseus, the winged slayer of Medusa. The projected title runs as follows:<br>

Olschki, a Library of Brunian studies that was initially assembled by<br>
Virgilio Salvestrini (1873–1954).29 Salvestrini was a studious bookseller<br>
whose shop, on Via XXIX Maggio, in front of the University of Pisa, was<br>
frequented by students and professors.30 The Salvestrini books—150 titles</p><p>From Paris to Rome, Hamburg and London</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:09  Oldal 243</p><p>244 Reflections of an Intellectual Burning</p><p>of which are now available online—include the main nineteenth-century<br>
editions of the complete works, as well as the principal studies on the<br>
philosopher’s life and thought. Salvestrini also collected various pamphlets<br>
and occasional papers echoing the intense controversies surrounding the<br>
erection of the Campo de’ Fiori monument, unveiled on June 9, 1889.</p><p>Warburg died before he could make use of this freshly acquired mate-<br>
rial and complete these projects. The remains are sparse notes in the K.B.W.<br>
Tagebuch which he took to Italy, as well as a folder entitled “Giordano<br>
Bruno,” kept in the Warburg Institute archive, which contains some leaves<br>
of notes and sketches.31 After the migration of the Warburg Institute to<br>
England in 1933, the library continued acquiring Bruno material, especial-<br>
ly from the late 1940s onwards when Frances A. Yates, who had already<br>
encountered the philosopher in her John Florio (1934), began the research<br>
that would produce her two most influential books: Giordano Bruno and<br>
the Hermetic Tradition (1964) and The Art of Memory (1966).<br>

This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to have worked on Giordano <br>
Bruno and his epoch. In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of his <br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary thinking upside down, <br>
and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as the theoretical consequences of his thought, <br>
the contributions all start from an exemplary passage drawn from Bruno’s great range of work <br>
or from texts close to his person and oeuvre. Presenting and elucidating pivotal points of the <br>
philosophia nolana, the essays both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy <br>
and provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual reflections that <br>
will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s works. They reconstruct his deconstruction <br>
and rearrangement of philosophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his <br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They explore the topics <br>
and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and point out the variance of his reception <br>
up to the present, both inside and outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and <br>
continuing fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>Central European University Press<br>

Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.</p><p>In his essay “…per speculum et in aenigmate…,” Michele Ciliberto dis-<br>
plays how “thinking through images” is the central point in Bruno’s nova<br>
filosofia. It is the topic not only of his meditations on the ars memoriae, but<br>
is continuously discussed both in his Italian as well as in his later Latin<br>
works. For Bruno, the use of images is a condition preceding every act of<br>
thinking. This leads him to a new conceptualisation of the process of cog-<br>
nition: Images or mental phantastic figures are like an interface between<br>
mind and nature, between the logical, abstract operations and the innu-<br>
merable appearances of the visible world. At the same time, the inex-<br>
haustible potency of fantasy to produce images makes us aware of the idea<br>
of infinity. In this context, the dialectic between fantasy and intellect,<br>
abstract synthesis and creative analysis is, as Ciliberto points out, vitally<br>
important: it shows the way of man’s approximation to the eternal truth,<br>
an infinite itinerarium, i.e., a metaphysical movement of man who by<br>
descending into himself tries to know the One, a way which allows him to<br>
touch the divine cause indirectly “through the mirror and in enigma.” </p><p>Following this, Anne Eusterschulte attempts to delineate Bruno’s assi -<br>
milation of heterogeneous elements of ancient philosophy and shows how,</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 4</p><p>5<br>

The last section of the book, Visibility of the Invisible: About the Sculpture<br>
Giordano Bruno by Alexander Polzin [2008], is dedicated to the statue of<br>
Giordano Bruno that was recently erected in Berlin. Besides a description<br>
of the statue and its pendants at Nola and Budapest made by the sculptor,<br>
Alexander Polzin, himself, the author Durs Grünbein gives a poet’s inter-<br>
pretation of the statue at the moment of its unveiling at Potsdamer Platz. He<br>
construes the heretic as an emblematic figure of a young, independent<br>
Europe and asks himself why Berlin—a city which Bruno, this great tra -<br>
veller, has never been to—and, specifically, an underground station could be</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 9</p><p>the right place to commemorate the philosopher from Nola. For Grün bein,<br>
the statue is an iconographic alarm signal, visualizing a rhetoric of fire, the<br>
language of alchemy and metamorphoses that characterizes Bruno’s think-<br>
ing. Finally, Grünbein brings thinkers and poets together in a virtual con-<br>
versation across time and space: Bruno, Nietzsche, Scho pen hau er, and<br>
Czesław Miłosz.</p><p>Anything but virtual were the exchanges we—philosophers, historians, and<br>
literary scholars—had about Giordano Bruno in the congenial and inspiring<br>
atmosphere of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin,<br>
and our discussions and debates sowed many seeds. We are proud to see<br>
how they have matured and grown now into this volume. At the end of this<br>
project, we want to express our gratitude towards several individuals and<br>
institutions for their unflinching support, financial as well as moral and in -<br>
tel lectual: Jürgen Renn and Yehuda Elkana, the Max Planck Insti tute for the<br>
History of Science, the Central European Uni versity, the Cent ral European<br>
University Press, and, last but definitely not least, to Andreas Edel.</p><p>Finally, we would like to thank the students who assisted us in the com-<br>
pletion of this volume with untiring effort, Fanny Neumann, Jussuf Spie gel,<br>
Charlotte Wetzel and, especially, Oliver Schumacher, who also translated<br>
Durs Grünbein’s contribution.</p><p>Freiburg and Berlin, September 2012 <br>

This theme is important to Bruno, who symptomatically picks it up<br>
again in the poem at the beginning of the Explicatio triginta sigillorum and<br>
“intimates his hope for the advent of a ‘mythical’ age when the world, wise<br>
at last, though late (sero sapiens), will see ignorance and hostile prejudices<br>
removed from its surface.”34 These ideas are rooted in a philosophy of his-<br>
tory inspired by Hermeticism that finds complete expression in the Spaccio,<br>
where Bruno even translates (while modifying deeply) the Lament of<br>
Hermes Trismegistus. In other words, these ideas are central in Bruno’s</p><p>“…per speculum et in aenigmate…”</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 49</p><p>50 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>mind and, although they emerge for the first time at this stage of his<br>
research, they are constantly considered right up to his last works, for<br>
example in some remarkable pages of the De immenso.</p><p>To investigate the reasons for the recurrence of these issues from both<br>
linguistic and conceptual viewpoints means to face the problem of the<br>
dynamics of Bruno’s ‘mind,’ a task that cannot be accomplished here. In<br>
the context of our line of reasoning, however, some elements can be point-<br>
ed out: First, these subjects, also outlined in De umbris, appear in a text<br>
that, for a long time, has been counted amongst the mnemotechnical works<br>
and implicitly dismissed due to an obsolete idea of Renaissance culture<br>
and philosophy. However, we must drop this misinterpretation if we want<br>
to understand Bruno’s theories, in this particular text and in general.</p><p>This text, in fact, has strong philosophical caliber and is perhaps one of<br>
the most relevant in Bruno’s œuvre. Yet, due to its composite structure, it<br>
also has the important merit of taking us straight into Bruno’s ‘workshop,’<br>
allowing us to both understand the manner in which his texts must be deci-<br>
phered in general and to define (or confirm) at least four specific points.<br>
These include the articulated theoretical basis of his ars, which tackles a<br>
number of gnosiologial, ontological, and ethical issues, evenly introducing<br>
them into the frame of the nova filosofia; the fact that ethico-political and<br>
religious issues are already established in his mnemotechnical works and<br>
destined to find a fuller development in the Spaccio (where the contro -<br>
versy against Puritans becomes central as much as vehement); the possi-<br>
bility, as a consequence, of dating the genesis of Bruno’s first conception<br>
of the Spaccio to the last period of his stay in Paris, though in the frame of<br>
a polemic that, in the Sigillus, is aimed against Protestants as well as<br>
against monastic orders; and, last but not least, the text allows us to figure<br>
out Bruno’s modus operandi.</p><p>Yet, one needs not exaggerate the relation between the Sigillus and the<br>
Spaccio. The persistency of these topics, even if in a short time span,<br>
attests to the continuity of some main themes and also to the incessant<br>
revision to which Bruno subjected his works.<br>

Sergius Kodera also examines Candelaio in his essay. He uncovers a<br>
line of political thought, an implicit commentary on important historical,<br>
political affairs, running throughout the whole comedy, leading up to<br>
Machiavelli. Although Bruno never even mentions the name of the philo -<br>
sopher-politician from Florence, Kodera detects the subterranean pre sence<br>
of Machiavelli in strategically important passages of Candelaio. He shows</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 7</p><p>8 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>how Bruno adapts the Machiavellian notions of vicissitudo and occasione<br>
and parallels Bruno’s re-evaluation of the sense of touch with Machi a -<br>
velli’s ideas: For both authors, it is hands-on knowledge rather than de -<br>
tached vision that is conducive to true insight and acquisition of power.<br>
Whereas Bruno makes it clear that this re-evaluation involves heavy meta-<br>
physical implications, Machiavelli and Bruno do share common ground<br>
again in their vehement criticism of Christianity as harmful to the commu-<br>
nity.</p><p>This section concludes with Henning Hufnagel’s analysis of Bruno’s<br>
shortest dialogue, Cabala del cavallo pegaseo. Hufnagel focuses on the dia-<br>
logue’s twisted structure. Cabala is one of the most disputed of Bruno’s<br>
texts and scholars have made many attempts to fix a positive theoretical<br>
me aning in the dialogue. Hufnagel shows that this is a hopeless fight<br>
because Bruno blends the dialogue with forms of paradoxical epideixis:<br>
Bruno piles up paradoxes until all claims negate and cancel each other.<br>
Hufnagel proposes Cabala should instead be read as a satire of knowledge.<br>
The transmission of alleged knowledge between the interlocutors collapses<br>
continually and Bruno lays bare their modes of argumentation. If anything<br>
is to be learned from Cabala, it is how the literary form of the dialogue can<br>
acquire the value of an argument. Thus, Cabala can be understood as a<br>
reflection on the dialectical possibilities of the dialogue as a genre.</p><p>In the fourth section in this volume, Reflections of an Intellectual Burning:<br>
Bruno’s Reception and Literary Afterlife, the horizon widens both themat-<br>
ically and temporally. This section looks at some of the traces Bruno’s life<br>
and work left in other philosophical, or even theological contexts, presents<br>
aspects of his sometimes curious literary afterlife—which extends to<br>
Bertolt Brecht and beyond—and tries to come to terms with the truly last-<br>
ing fascination exerted by the man from Nola.</p><p>Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann explores the possibilities of picturing me -<br>
ta  physics by analysing a copper engraving in Heinrich Khunrath’s Amphi -<br>
theatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. In this image, the Kabbalistic foundation of<br>
all being, both the divine and the creatural, is symbolically depicted. For<br>
Bruno, the externalization of the first cause—which is in itself unknow-<br>
able, because it only reveals itself in its expression—is, at the same time,<br>
the beginning of all spatiality. This idea corresponds materially to the<br>
imaging of the first cause, as it is represented in the Leipzig theosopher<br>
Khunrath’s great work Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. He goes beyond<br>
Bruno, however, when he problematizes the question of the symbolism of<br>
the divine externalizations.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 8<br>

5</p><p>by transforming traditions, he expounds a theory of a heroic philosophical<br>
life. The Platonic allegory of the soul living in a cave of intellectual blind-<br>
ness serves as a central symbol demonstrating the ignorance and philo-<br>
sophical narrowness of traditional as well as contemporary thought, which<br>
avoids looking at the truth through the “eyes of reason.” Following the<br>
antique model, Bruno takes the interconnection of natural philosophy,<br>
epistemology and moral philosophy as a starting point to criticize a false<br>
and delimited cosmology, to establish the theory of the infinite universe<br>
containing innumerable worlds and to reject a short-sighted interpretation<br>
of sensory perceptions as a basis for epistemic evidence. Referring to the<br>
philosophy of Epicurus and his poetical follower Lucretius, combined with<br>
neo-Platonic motifs of the soul’s ascent to the One, Bruno breaks through<br>
the limited caves of the physical and epistemological as well as the misin-<br>
terpreted moral world. The self-awareness of the true philosophical exis-<br>
tence, engaged in an infinite process of venture and vicissitude, opens the<br>
eyes to the manifestation of the One, which is the deepest ground inside<br>
the soul. </p><p>The second section of this volume is entitled Experience and Vision of a<br>
New Cosmic Order: Giordano Bruno’s Natural Philosophy. Here, central<br>
aspects of Bruno’s cosmology and his transformation of classical concepts<br>
of natural philosophy are explored. It focuses on problems of cosmic order<br>
and the conceptualization of infinity in a physical, mathematical, and<br>
metaphysical sense. Re-formulating traditional concepts of space and loca-<br>
tion, extensive and intensive infinity, motion and time, Bruno confronts us<br>
with a comprehensive transformation of philosophical and scientific<br>
thought.</p><p>Commenting the third chapter of De immenso et innumerabilibus,<br>
Miguel A. Granada elucidates how Bruno, after having presented the the-<br>
ological and anthropological impact of cosmic infinity, conceptualizes the<br>
structure of the infinite universe, embracing innumerable planetary sys-<br>
tems. Referring to the Epicurean concept of a homogenous infinite uni-<br>
verse, Bruno argues that in this infinite cosmic space there is no centre or<br>
periphery but only a relativity of positions. Due to this Epicurean homo-<br>
geneity, there must be a similarity of structures in the whole universe. And<br>
for that reason, due to a specific point of view, every star can be seen as the<br>
centre of an orbicular system of surrounding planets. As Granada points<br>
out, Bruno is the first philosopher who postulates a plurality of “worlds”<br>
or planetary systems, affirming at the same time that there is one law of<br>
nature regulating all cosmic movements. He, therefore, goes beyond tradi-</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 5</p><p>6 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>tional restrictions—which are still binding Kepler, e.g.—and, in doing so,<br>
anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.<br>

serious contemporary of Galilei. Although there are deep philosophical<br>
and methodological differences, both agree that Copernicus’s heliocentric<br>
system is not just a mathematical hypothesis but an explanation of the real<br>
cosmic structures. Whereas Bruno’s convictions are based on the study of<br>
ancient philosophy, the basis of Galilei’s theories are innovative instru-<br>
mental practices that allow him to make precise observations and calcula-<br>
tions. Both share an anti-Aristotelian impetus, abolishing the distinction<br>
between supralunar and sublunar physics: Both attest there is but one<br>
homogeneous world, governed by one natural law. Finally, they analogo -<br>
usly interpret the Scriptures regarding natural knowledge. In fact, Bru no<br>
literally anticipates the allegoric interpretation of the Scriptures later<br>
adopted by Galilei: The aim of the Bible and of religious dogma in gener-<br>
al is social and moral discipline and not the description of natural truth.</p><p>The third section of this volume, Forms of Non-Conformity: Bruno’s Works<br>
as Literary Texts, shifts the focus from Bruno’s ideas to his texts. Bruno<br>
was a versatile, highly experimental writer, well-experienced in many gen-<br>
res and styles and familiar with numerous, especially heterodox and eccen-<br>
tric traditions. His disposition for polemics, satire and paradox, his lin-<br>
guistic inventiveness and scorn of literary decorum make his texts<br>
colourful and compelling reading. The essays presented here take a look at<br>
the literary aspect of Bruno’s philosophy and examine how the form of<br>
Bruno’s texts determines their meaning. </p><p>Nuccio Ordine takes on the tripartite structure of Bruno’s comedy<br>
Candelaio, and asks why not only one, as in other plays, but three stock<br>
characters of Renaissance comedy are ridiculed here. He argues that the<br>
answer is to be found in the theory of the comic as set forth in Plato’s<br>
Philebus. Here, Socrates identifies three basic situations of ridicule—situ-<br>
ations perfectly embodied by the three protagonists of Candelaio. Thus,<br>
Ordine sheds light on the way Bruno works when writing his texts. Stres -<br>
sing the gnoseological function of the comic in Bruno’s text, he finally indi-<br>
cates some central elements of Bruno’s philosophy.</p><p>Sergius Kodera also examines Candelaio in his essay. He uncovers a<br>
line of political thought, an implicit commentary on important historical,<br>
political affairs, running throughout the whole comedy, leading up to<br>
Machiavelli. Although Bruno never even mentions the name of the philo -<br>
sopher-politician from Florence, Kodera detects the subterranean pre sence<br>
of Machiavelli in strategically important passages of Candelaio. He shows</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 7</p><p>8 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>how Bruno adapts the Machiavellian notions of vicissitudo and occasione<br>
and parallels Bruno’s re-evaluation of the sense of touch with Machi a -<br>
velli’s ideas: For both authors, it is hands-on knowledge rather than de -<br>
tached vision that is conducive to true insight and acquisition of power.<br>
Whereas Bruno makes it clear that this re-evaluation involves heavy meta-<br>
physical implications, Machiavelli and Bruno do share common ground<br>
again in their vehement criticism of Christianity as harmful to the commu-<br>
nity.<br>

Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.<br>

To rescue the mnemotechnical texts from oblivion, scholars had to<br>
eliminate the interpretations that dominated the nineteenth-century (and<br>
first half of the twentieth) as they were mostly concerned with identifying<br>
Bruno as a forerunner of various modern schools of thought. To reaffirm<br>
the value and centrality of the mnemotechnical works, it was important to<br>
get rid of a stereotyped image of the Renaissance, of outdated views con-<br>
cerning the relationship between the Renaissance and modernity, and—in<br>
primis—of a unilateral and static view of modernity. This task was neither<br>
simple nor short; however, it is thanks to the pioneering investigations car-<br>
ried out in the course of the twentieth-century by scholars like Warburg,<br>
Garin, Rossi, Vasoli, and Frances A. Yates that magic and mnemotechnics<br>
are now commonly perceived as central features of the Renaissance med-<br>
itation on mankind, nature, and experience. The constitutive core of<br>
Giordano Bruno’s thought would be impossible to decipher without taking<br>
his mnemotechnical works into consideration.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 36</p><p>37</p><p>Bruno’s idea of the impossibility of a process of thinking which is not<br>
“thinking through images” is the operating and unfolding “principle” in<br>
his mnemotechnical works, making them the most fascinating, ingenious<br>
and arduous text of the nova filosofia. It is a sort of Urtext, essential to the<br>
understanding of the genesis, features, and development of his philosophy.<br>
Studying his experiments with mnemotechnics means gaining direct access<br>
to Bruno’s “philosophical workshop” and access to this workshop is an<br>
indispensable tool for comprehending Bruno’s “mind” and for following<br>
the patterns from which the key elements of the nova filosofia matured.<br>
These texts are very complex, sometimes obscure, and difficult to inter-<br>
pret. Still, how they were reduced to mere extravagant oddities that placed<br>
Bruno in the category of “pre-modernity” is one of those mysteries that<br>
only historians are able to deconstruct. This is not surprising; after all,<br>
there is no historiography without categories or, indeed, without ideolo-<br>
gies. It would be enough to keep in mind (as a preventive therapy) that the<br>
Past is another Present, and should be studied accordingly.3</p><p>In a passage from a recent commentary to Explicatio triginta sigillorum,<br>
there is a statement, which can be espoused in every respect: </p><p>The brain thinks through images, because all abstract and conceptu-<br>
al information originates from the reading and interpretation of fan-<br>
tastic figures—either natural or artificial—and the fantastic dimen-<br>
sion acts as interface between the logic dimension and Nature, since<br>
all the experience of the world is seen through it, as in a mirror; it is<br>
not, however, a passive and uncontrolled magma: in fact, since it<br>
“bor ders” on the cogitative faculty, it is constantly open to the ratio-<br>
nal dimension, which incessantly derives from and pours into the<br>
partial and progressive impressions that are the object of its elabo-<br>
rations. In conclusion, mnemonic loci and the images of memories,<br>
ideated by Bruno, are but peculiar and defined modalities – regulat-<br>
ed by the laws and principles of a specific ars—of a cognitive opera-<br>
tive principle spontaneous and innate in man which also receives a<br>
sort of enhancement and optimization when rationality ‘descends<br>
upon’ it to regulate its actions.4<br>

the universe decrees that as this divine horse in the celestial region cannot show<br>
itself except to the navel (where the star that terminates there is placed in dispute<br>

    <p>Here’s a detailed analysis of the discussion of Frances Yates in the book <strong>&quot;Turning Traditions Upside Down&quot;</strong> regarding her interpretation of Giordano Bruno:</p><p><h3><strong>Context of Yates&#x27;s Influence</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li>Frances Yates is acknowledged for her pivotal role in bringing Bruno’s connection to Hermeticism to the forefront of modern scholarship.</li><br>
<li>In her work, particularly <em>Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition</em> (1964), Yates portrays Bruno as a mystical thinker deeply rooted in the Hermetic tradition, emphasizing his role as a magus rather than a philosopher or scientist.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h3><strong>Critique of Yates in the Volume</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Reduction to Hermeticism:</strong> The volume critiques Yates for overly simplifying Bruno’s intellectual profile by centering Hermeticism as the dominant framework for his thought. The editors argue that while Hermeticism was significant, Bruno’s synthesis of ideas is broader, incorporating Neo-Platonism, Copernican cosmology, and Aristotelian critique alongside Hermetic elements.</li><br>
<li><strong>Misrepresentation of Modernity:</strong> Yates is seen as positioning Bruno as a figure looking backward to mystical traditions rather than forward to modern philosophy and science. In contrast, this volume argues that Bruno&#x27;s Hermeticism was a vehicle for his forward-looking vision of an infinite and dynamic universe.</li><br>
<li><strong>Philosophical Depth vs. Mysticism:</strong> The book contends that Yates underappreciates the philosophical rigor of Bruno’s work, presenting Hermeticism primarily as a mystical, magical tradition. The authors highlight how Bruno reinterpreted Hermetic ideas in service of a systematic cosmology and epistemology.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h3><strong>Key Differences in Interpretation</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Focus on Hermetic Texts:</strong> Yates emphasizes Bruno’s use of texts like the <em>Corpus Hermeticum</em> to develop a magical cosmology. This volume points out that Bruno’s engagement with Hermeticism is not merely mystical but philosophical, using its symbolic language to explore concepts like infinity, unity, and cosmic order.</li><br>
<li><strong>Integration of Traditions:</strong> Yates’s reading isolates Hermeticism as a standalone influence. The volume argues for a more integrated perspective, where Hermeticism interacts with Neo-Platonism, Epicurean physics, and Renaissance natural philosophy to inform Bruno’s ideas.</li><br>
<li><strong>Modern Scientific Relevance:</strong> While Yates casts Bruno as outside the trajectory of modern science, this volume positions him as a proto-modern thinker, with Hermeticism providing a metaphorical framework rather than a mystical doctrine.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h3><strong>Support from the Text</strong></h3><br>
The discussion explicitly situates Yates within the historiography of Bruno scholarship, acknowledging her contributions while critiquing her tendency to overstate Hermeticism&#x27;s dominance. Several essays in the volume address this tension, particularly in the context of Bruno’s <em>Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante</em> and <em>De immenso et innumerabilibus</em>, where Hermeticism is interwoven with broader metaphysical and cosmological arguments【22:3†source】【22:11†source】.</p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>Takeaway</strong></h3><br>
The book respects Yates&#x27;s influence but seeks to revise her interpretation, presenting Bruno as a thinker who transcends Hermeticism to engage in a more universal intellectual project. This nuanced view highlights Bruno’s role in the transition from Renaissance traditions to early modern philosophy.</p><p>Let me know if you’d like further details or specific quotes!</p>

reconfiguration of classical traditions.</td><td>Frames Bruno as a disruptor of established epistemic and metaphysical norms, particularly through his critique of geocentrism and finite cosmologies.</td><td>Risks positioning Bruno’s deconstruction as wholly oppositional rather than as part of a dialectical engagement with inherited traditions.</td><td>Bruno’s critique of tradition is not simply a rejection but a reconstruction, integrating elements of older systems into a radically new framework.</td><td>&quot;To understand Bruno is to see how he reconstructs what he deconstructs, offering a new synthesis of old traditions.&quot;</td><td>Essays on epistemology and cosmology in <em>Turning Traditions Upside Down</em>, particularly the sections addressing Bruno’s critique of Scholasticism.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cosmological Modernity</strong></td><td>Examines Bruno’s concept of an infinite, centerless universe and its implications for the scientific and philosophical thought of his time and beyond.</td><td>Demonstrates Bruno’s contribution to modern cosmology by rejecting anthropocentric and hierarchical models of the universe.</td><td>Engages with debates on whether Bruno’s cosmology was scientific or philosophical, and whether it prefigures or diverges from modern physics.</td><td>Bruno’s cosmology bridges Renaissance metaphysics and modern scientific thought, positioning him as a precursor to the infinite universe models in science.</td><td>&quot;Bruno conceives a universe without center or periphery, where all worlds are of equal importance.&quot;</td><td>References to Bruno’s <em>De immenso et innumerabilibus</em> and comparisons to Copernican and Newtonian ideas throughout the volume.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Philosophy and

    <p><table><tr><th><strong>Section</strong></th><th><strong>Contents</strong></th><th><strong>Contributions</strong></th><th><strong>Challenges</strong></th><th><strong>Argument</strong></th><th><strong>Quotation</strong></th><th><strong>Sources</strong></th></tr><tr><td><strong>Aristotelian Substance Theory</strong></td><td>Scholasticism’s reliance on Aristotelian metaphysics, where reality is understood in terms of substances and accidents.</td><td>Provides a framework for analyzing the composition of the natural world and the interactions of matter and form.</td><td>Bruno critiques the static nature of substance theory, proposing instead a dynamic unity where matter and form are inseparable and interconnected.</td><td>Scholastic ideas of substance and accident are too rigid to accommodate Bruno’s vision of a living, infinite cosmos.</td><td>&quot;Substance, as defined in Aristotelian terms, cannot capture the fluid and dynamic nature of reality.&quot;</td><td>Aristotelian philosophy and its Scholastic interpretations in Bruno’s critiques, particularly in <em>De la causa, principio et uno</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hierarchical Cosmos</strong></td><td>Scholastic cosmology upholds a finite, hierarchical universe with Earth at the center, based on Aristotelian-Ptolemaic models.</td><td>Reinforces the medieval worldview and the coherence of the geocentric system.</td><td>Bruno rejects the geocentric, finite cosmos, advocating for an infinite, centerless universe governed by universal laws rather than divine hierarchy.</td><td>Scholastic cosmology is incompatible with Bruno’s infinite universe, which decentralizes humanity and Earth.</td><td>&quot;The universe has no center, no periphery, and no fixed hierarchy of being.&quot;</td><td>Ptolemaic-Aristotelian influences evident in the cosmological debates of the Renaissance and Bruno’s responses in <em>De immenso et innumerabilibus</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Faith and Reason</strong></td><td>Scholasticism emphasizes the harmony between faith and reason, where philosophical inquiry serves to clarify and support religious doctrine.</td><td>Establishes a structured approach to reconciling theological and philosophical principles.</td><td>Bruno challenges the dominance of theological doctrine over free inquiry, advocating for the independence of philosophy from religious constraints.</td><td>Faith and reason should operate independently, as Bruno argues for a philosophy unrestricted by religious dogma.</td><td>&quot;Philosophy should not serve theology but should seek truth on its own terms.&quot;</td><td>Discussions in <em>Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante</em> and <em>De la causa, principio et uno</em>, where Bruno critiques the subjugation of philosophy to theology.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Causality and Teleology</strong></td><td>Scholasticism emphasizes final causes, where natural phenomena are explained in terms of their ultimate purpose within a divine plan.</td><td>Provides a teleological framework for understanding natural and metaphysical processes.</td><td>Bruno rejects final causes as limiting, proposing instead a naturalistic explanation of phenomena based on intrinsic principles and infinite motion.</td><td>Teleological explanations are inadequate for Bruno’s vision of a universe governed by intrinsic, dynamic principles rather than predetermined purposes.</td><td>&quot;Nature’s movements are infinite, without end or preordained purpose.&quot;</td><td>Aristotelian teleology adapted by Scholastic thinkers, critiqued in Bruno’s works such as <em>De immenso et innumerabilibus</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Analogy of Being (Analogia Entis)</strong></td><td>Scholasticism’s principle that being exists analogically across different levels, reflecting divine order.</td><td>Reinforces the hierarchical structure of the cosmos, linking all levels of existence through a divine order.</td><td>Bruno reinterprets analogy to emphasize unity over hierarchy, rejecting the strict levels of being in favor of a dynamic continuum of existence.</td><td>Analogy should reflect the unity and interconnectedness of all things rather than reinforce rigid hierarchical divisions.</td><td>&quot;Being is not divided into discrete hierarchies but flows continuously across all existence.&quot;</td><td>Scholastic interpretations of analogy critiqued and transformed in Bruno’s metaphysical works, especially <em>De la causa, principio et uno</em>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Prime Mover</strong></td><td>Scholastic thought incorporates Aristotle’s concept of the Prime Mover, a divine force responsible for the motion and order of the cosmos.</td><td>Aligns natural motion with divine intention, creating a coherent cosmological framework tied to theological principles.</td><td>Bruno critiques the necessity of a Prime Mover, proposing instead a self-sustaining, infinite universe governed by immanent principles of motion and change.</td><td>The infinite universe operates without the need for a Prime Mover, as motion is intrinsic to nature itself.</td><td>&quot;The universe moves by its own principles, not by the dictates of a distant Prime Mover.&quot;</td><td>Aristotelian and Scholastic cosmology critiqued in Bruno’s <em>De immenso et innumerabilibus</em> and <em>De la causa, principio et uno</em>.</td></tr></table></p><p>This table

inaugurated at Potsdamer Platz in the center of Berlin. The statue depicts<br>
the vulnerable body of a philosopher who is turning the world upside-down<br>

Bruno’s tragedy, a man who dared to reconsider the fundamentals of the<br>
world as they had been passed down throughout the ages and who struggled<br>
to find his place in Europe. Yet, after peregrination across the con tin ent, he<br>
ended up cast as a heretic in all three Christian churches of the occident.<br>

transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary<br>
thinking upside down, and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as<br>
the theoretical consequences of his thought, the contributions of this vol-<br>
ume all start from a selected text, an exemplary passage drawn from Bru -<br>
no’s great range of work or from texts close to his person and œuvre. Pre -<br>
senting and elucidating pivotal points of the philosophia nolana, the essays<br>
both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy and<br>
provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual<br>
reflections that will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s<br>
works. They reconstruct Bruno’s deconstruction and rearrangement of<br>
phi  lo  sophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his<br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They<br>
ex plore the topics and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and<br>
point out the variance of his reception up to the present, both inside and<br>
outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and continuing<br>
fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>The results of the contributor’s investigations are presented in four sec-<br>
tions, according to four main fields of research interest. The first section<br>
entitled Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary: Bruno’s Methods and Thin -<br>
king, examines Bruno’s methodological procedures. The essays show how<br>
the Nolan undermined traditional positions, by a subtle reflexion on epis-<br>
temological principles, logical structures, or metaphysical presuppositions,<br>
to secure evidence for his philosophy of the infinite and its inherent con-<br>
sequences which revolutionized the fields of metaphysics and epistemolo-<br>
gy, physics, cosmology and anthropology. Bruno’s method of appropriat-<br>
ing and concatenating older philosophical concepts appears to be both a<br>
method of critical revision as well as systematic transformation.</p><p>Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>

anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.</p><p>Wolfgang Neuser presents an alternative interpretation of Bruno’s the-<br>
ory of matter. Against the backdrop of the controversial medieval debates<br>
about atomism concerning the attributes or qualities of atoms, their cor-<br>
puscular or essential substantiality, and the appreciation of them as dis-<br>
tinct particles, Bruno develops an understanding of matter that merges the<br>
Aristotelian concept of substance with atomistic ideas and the Neo-Pla -<br>
tonic concept of matter, according to which matter is filled with spirit.<br>
Bruno differentiates three manifestations of the metaphysical monad, i.e.,<br>
the undivided, infinite unum that systematically underlies everything.<br>
These manifestations are the constituents of matter: spiritus, based on the<br>
neo-Platonic concept of a spiritual virtue inherent in all matter; spatium,<br>
or the structural explication of the indivisible, un-extended point, which<br>
emerges in a process of self-generation; and atomus, the smallest indivisi-<br>
ble or the physical minimum. Spirit, space, and atom are the structural<br>
modes of the expansion of infinite unity. Based on this conceptualisation<br>
of matter, Neuser characterizes Bruno as a Renaissance philosopher who,<br>

based foundation of knowledge, representative for thinkers from the Mo -<br>
dern Age like Descartes, Spinoza or Leibniz. </p><p>Enrico Giannetto’s chapter emphasizes no less than the astonishing fact<br>
that Giordano Bruno—notwithstanding the significant differences in theo-<br>
retical premises—presents a theory of relativity of time and motion three<br>
hundred years before Poincaré and Einstein. While his non-mechanistic<br>
conception of nature was an obstacle in recognizing Bruno as a serious sci-<br>
entist, according to Giannetto, Bruno’s importance within the history of<br>
theoretical physics is irrefutable. He argues that the relativity of time is<br>
one consequence of Bruno’s concept of cosmic infinity, also entailing the<br>
relativity of the localisation of planets or stars and of their motion, rota-<br>
tion and orbits within a uniform space. Rejecting the Aristotelian assump-<br>
tion of a primum mobile, Bruno argues for the plurality of incommensu-<br>
rable times due to the infinity of uniform motions within the universe.<br>
Turning the Aristotelian doctrine upside down, Bruno regards (relative)<br>
motion as the measure of time.</p><p>Arcangelo Rossi, comparing the cosmological theories of Copernicus,<br>
Bruno, and Galilei, attests a striking correspondence between the Nolan<br>

The last section of the book, Visibility of the Invisible: About the Sculpture<br>
Giordano Bruno by Alexander Polzin [2008], is dedicated to the statue of<br>
Giordano Bruno that was recently erected in Berlin. Besides a description<br>
of the statue and its pendants at Nola and Budapest made by the sculptor,<br>
Alexander Polzin, himself, the author Durs Grünbein gives a poet’s inter-<br>
pretation of the statue at the moment of its unveiling at Potsdamer Platz. He<br>
construes the heretic as an emblematic figure of a young, independent<br>
Europe and asks himself why Berlin—a city which Bruno, this great tra -<br>
veller, has never been to—and, specifically, an underground station could be</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 9</p><p>the right place to commemorate the philosopher from Nola. For Grün bein,<br>
the statue is an iconographic alarm signal, visualizing a rhetoric of fire, the<br>
language of alchemy and metamorphoses that characterizes Bruno’s think-<br>
ing. Finally, Grünbein brings thinkers and poets together in a virtual con-<br>
versation across time and space: Bruno, Nietzsche, Scho pen hau er, and<br>
Czesław Miłosz.</p><p>Anything but virtual were the exchanges we—philosophers, historians, and<br>

ing point for rethinking Giordano Bruno’s philosophy and his provocative<br>
aspirations in the world of letters. It certainly would have been to Bruno’s<br>
liking; someone who, in his writings, often presented himself as a Mercu ri -<br>
an, larger-than-life figure who has come to put things straight: the No lan,<br>
enlightening his contemporaries about the misleading paths of traditional<br>
doctrines and opening minds for the discovery of true philosophy. </p><p>Born in 1548 near the town of Nola in the Kingdom of Naples, Gior -<br>
dano Bruno is known today as an exceptional, yet ambivalent figure with-<br>
in the history of ideas. As a great scholar, celebrated for his comprehen-<br>
sive erudition, famous for his emphatic defence of philosophical inquiry<br>
against religious doctrine and his rigid attacks against reputed authorities,<br>
he caused an intellectual stir wherever he went. Sometimes his interventi -<br>
ons were received with great éclat; more often, however, they created aca -<br>
de mic scandal. Bruno impressed the French King Henri III who made him<br>
one of his “lecteurs royaux”; three years later, he had to leave Paris in<br>
tumultuous circumstances after a disputation had grown out of control. In<br>
the meantime, Bruno had upset the intellectual scene in Elizabethan<br>
England with his six Italian dialogues. Moving between different frontiers,<br>
confessional beliefs, philosophical schools, academic parties and institu-<br>
tional interests, Bruno—who did not mince matters—came under attack<br>
from many sides. </p><p>Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné<br>
of his time, the Scholastic Aristotelian philosophy that presented a view of<br>
man and cosmos, which Bruno had been dissatisfied with since his time in a<br>
Dominican convent in Naples. For his project of philosophical reform, Bruno<br>
draws on a large variety of sources: on Platonic, pre-Socratic, Py tha   gorean,<br>
and Hermetic ideas, on thinkers such as Plotinus, Averroes, Nicholas of<br>
Cusa, Raimundus Lullus and Ficino. He builds on the metho do  logy, flour-<br>
ishing during the Renaissance, of mnemotechnics. And he uses all these</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 1</p><p>2 Turning Traditions Upside Down<br>

HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 6</p><p>7</p><p>no’s position within the history of natural sciences. He presents him as a<br>
serious contemporary of Galilei. Although there are deep philosophical<br>
and methodological differences, both agree that Copernicus’s heliocentric<br>
system is not just a mathematical hypothesis but an explanation of the real<br>
cosmic structures. Whereas Bruno’s convictions are based on the study of<br>
ancient philosophy, the basis of Galilei’s theories are innovative instru-<br>
mental practices that allow him to make precise observations and calcula-<br>
tions. Both share an anti-Aristotelian impetus, abolishing the distinction<br>
between supralunar and sublunar physics: Both attest there is but one<br>
homogeneous world, governed by one natural law. Finally, they analogo -<br>
usly interpret the Scriptures regarding natural knowledge. In fact, Bru no<br>
literally anticipates the allegoric interpretation of the Scriptures later<br>
adopted by Galilei: The aim of the Bible and of religious dogma in gener-<br>
al is social and moral discipline and not the description of natural truth.</p><p>The third section of this volume, Forms of Non-Conformity: Bruno’s Works<br>
as Literary Texts, shifts the focus from Bruno’s ideas to his texts. Bruno<br>
was a versatile, highly experimental writer, well-experienced in many gen-<br>
res and styles and familiar with numerous, especially heterodox and eccen-<br>
tric traditions. His disposition for polemics, satire and paradox, his lin-<br>
guistic inventiveness and scorn of literary decorum make his texts<br>
colourful and compelling reading. The essays presented here take a look at<br>
the literary aspect of Bruno’s philosophy and examine how the form of<br>
Bruno’s texts determines their meaning. </p><p>Nuccio Ordine takes on the tripartite structure of Bruno’s comedy<br>
Candelaio, and asks why not only one, as in other plays, but three stock<br>
characters of Renaissance comedy are ridiculed here. He argues that the<br>
answer is to be found in the theory of the comic as set forth in Plato’s<br>
Philebus. Here, Socrates identifies three basic situations of ridicule—situ-<br>
ations perfectly embodied by the three protagonists of Candelaio. Thus,<br>
Ordine sheds light on the way Bruno works when writing his texts. Stres -<br>
sing the gnoseological function of the comic in Bruno’s text, he finally indi-<br>
cates some central elements of Bruno’s philosophy.</p><p>Sergius Kodera also examines Candelaio in his essay. He uncovers a<br>
line of political thought, an implicit commentary on important historical,<br>
political affairs, running throughout the whole comedy, leading up to<br>
Machiavelli. Although Bruno never even mentions the name of the philo -<br>
sopher-politician from Florence, Kodera detects the subterranean pre sence<br>
of Machiavelli in strategically important passages of Candelaio. He shows</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 7</p><p>8 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>how Bruno adapts the Machiavellian notions of vicissitudo and occasione<br>
and parallels Bruno’s re-evaluation of the sense of touch with Machi a -<br>
velli’s ideas: For both authors, it is hands-on knowledge rather than de -<br>
tached vision that is conducive to true insight and acquisition of power.<br>
Whereas Bruno makes it clear that this re-evaluation involves heavy meta-<br>
physical implications, Machiavelli and Bruno do share common ground<br>
again in their vehement criticism of Christianity as harmful to the commu-<br>
nity.<br>

Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.<br>

polemic controvert? Descriptions of this kind fall short of grasping the multifold character of “the <br>
Nolan.” Deconstructing the relationship between God and the outside world gave distinction to <br>
his life—and his refusal to recant when facing the stake somehow set him apart from the world. <br>
Since then, the debate about the Nolan has been dominated by the interest in the comprehensive <br>
oeuvre of the philosopher, and by attempts to make him a protagonist of the freedom of thought.</p><p>This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to have worked on Giordano <br>
Bruno and his epoch. In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of his <br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary thinking upside down, <br>
and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as the theoretical consequences of his thought, <br>
the contributions all start from an exemplary passage drawn from Bruno’s great range of work <br>
or from texts close to his person and oeuvre. Presenting and elucidating pivotal points of the <br>
philosophia nolana, the essays both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy <br>
and provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual reflections that <br>
will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s works. They reconstruct his deconstruction <br>
and rearrangement of philosophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his <br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They explore the topics <br>
and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and point out the variance of his reception <br>
up to the present, both inside and outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and <br>
continuing fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>Central European University Press<br>

shortest dialogue, Cabala del cavallo pegaseo. Hufnagel focuses on the dia-<br>
logue’s twisted structure. Cabala is one of the most disputed of Bruno’s<br>
texts and scholars have made many attempts to fix a positive theoretical<br>
me aning in the dialogue. Hufnagel shows that this is a hopeless fight<br>
because Bruno blends the dialogue with forms of paradoxical epideixis:<br>
Bruno piles up paradoxes until all claims negate and cancel each other.<br>
Hufnagel proposes Cabala should instead be read as a satire of knowledge.<br>
The transmission of alleged knowledge between the interlocutors collapses<br>
continually and Bruno lays bare their modes of argumentation. If anything<br>
is to be learned from Cabala, it is how the literary form of the dialogue can<br>
acquire the value of an argument. Thus, Cabala can be understood as a<br>
reflection on the dialectical possibilities of the dialogue as a genre.</p><p>In the fourth section in this volume, Reflections of an Intellectual Burning:<br>
Bruno’s Reception and Literary Afterlife, the horizon widens both themat-<br>
ically and temporally. This section looks at some of the traces Bruno’s life<br>
and work left in other philosophical, or even theological contexts, presents<br>
aspects of his sometimes curious literary afterlife—which extends to<br>
Bertolt Brecht and beyond—and tries to come to terms with the truly last-<br>
ing fascination exerted by the man from Nola.</p><p>Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann explores the possibilities of picturing me -<br>
ta  physics by analysing a copper engraving in Heinrich Khunrath’s Amphi -<br>
theatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. In this image, the Kabbalistic foundation of<br>
all being, both the divine and the creatural, is symbolically depicted. For<br>
Bruno, the externalization of the first cause—which is in itself unknow-<br>
able, because it only reveals itself in its expression—is, at the same time,<br>
the beginning of all spatiality. This idea corresponds materially to the<br>
imaging of the first cause, as it is represented in the Leipzig theosopher<br>
Khunrath’s great work Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. He goes beyond<br>
Bruno, however, when he problematizes the question of the symbolism of<br>
the divine externalizations.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 8<br>

Right from the beginning, Bruno was an “academico di nulla aca de mia,”<br>
an “academic of no academy,” as he calls himself in his comedy Candle-<br>
bearer. Soon enough, he became not only institutionally, but literally home-<br>
less, wandering from Italy to France, to England, to Germany and back<br>
again over the Alps, watched by suspicious eyes because of his radical visi -<br>
ons of intellectual reform. At last the prominent “universally learned man<br>
who did not, however, have any religion,” as one contemporary de scribed<br>
him, fell victim to denunciation in Venice and, after a nearly eight-year-<br>
long trial, was condemned by the Roman inquisition to be burnt at the<br>
stake. The verdict was executed on the Campo de’ Fiori in Rome, on Feb -<br>
ruary 17, 1600. The stench of burnt flesh is said to have lingered for days.</p><p>The tragedy of Bruno’s life and thought may be seen as a radical sym-<br>
bol of the human struggle for knowledge, rising to the challenge of free-<br>
dom of thought at the risk of losing ground. It is upside down, therefore,<br>
that Alexander Polzin’s sculpture shows Bruno.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 2</p><p>3</p><p>In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary<br>
thinking upside down, and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as<br>
the theoretical consequences of his thought, the contributions of this vol-<br>
ume all start from a selected text, an exemplary passage drawn from Bru -<br>
no’s great range of work or from texts close to his person and œuvre. Pre -<br>
senting and elucidating pivotal points of the philosophia nolana, the essays<br>
both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy and<br>
provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual<br>
reflections that will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s<br>
works. They reconstruct Bruno’s deconstruction and rearrangement of<br>
phi  lo  sophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his<br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They<br>
ex plore the topics and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and<br>
point out the variance of his reception up to the present, both inside and<br>
outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and continuing<br>
fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>The results of the contributor’s investigations are presented in four sec-<br>
tions, according to four main fields of research interest. The first section<br>
entitled Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary: Bruno’s Methods and Thin -<br>
king, examines Bruno’s methodological procedures. The essays show how<br>
the Nolan undermined traditional positions, by a subtle reflexion on epis-<br>
temological principles, logical structures, or metaphysical presuppositions,<br>
to secure evidence for his philosophy of the infinite and its inherent con-<br>
sequences which revolutionized the fields of metaphysics and epistemolo-<br>
gy, physics, cosmology and anthropology. Bruno’s method of appropriat-<br>
ing and concatenating older philosophical concepts appears to be both a<br>
method of critical revision as well as systematic transformation.<br>

world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.</p><p>In his essay “…per speculum et in aenigmate…,” Michele Ciliberto dis-<br>
plays how “thinking through images” is the central point in Bruno’s nova<br>
filosofia. It is the topic not only of his meditations on the ars memoriae, but<br>
is continuously discussed both in his Italian as well as in his later Latin<br>
works. For Bruno, the use of images is a condition preceding every act of<br>
thinking. This leads him to a new conceptualisation of the process of cog-<br>
nition: Images or mental phantastic figures are like an interface between<br>
mind and nature, between the logical, abstract operations and the innu-<br>
merable appearances of the visible world. At the same time, the inex-<br>
haustible potency of fantasy to produce images makes us aware of the idea<br>
of infinity. In this context, the dialectic between fantasy and intellect,<br>
abstract synthesis and creative analysis is, as Ciliberto points out, vitally<br>
important: it shows the way of man’s approximation to the eternal truth,<br>
an infinite itinerarium, i.e., a metaphysical movement of man who by<br>
descending into himself tries to know the One, a way which allows him to<br>
touch the divine cause indirectly “through the mirror and in enigma.” </p><p>Following this, Anne Eusterschulte attempts to delineate Bruno’s assi -<br>
milation of heterogeneous elements of ancient philosophy and shows how,</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 4</p><p>5<br>

This theme is important to Bruno, who symptomatically picks it up<br>
again in the poem at the beginning of the Explicatio triginta sigillorum and<br>
“intimates his hope for the advent of a ‘mythical’ age when the world, wise<br>
at last, though late (sero sapiens), will see ignorance and hostile prejudices<br>
removed from its surface.”34 These ideas are rooted in a philosophy of his-<br>
tory inspired by Hermeticism that finds complete expression in the Spaccio,<br>
where Bruno even translates (while modifying deeply) the Lament of<br>
Hermes Trismegistus. In other words, these ideas are central in Bruno’s</p><p>“…per speculum et in aenigmate…”</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 49</p><p>50 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>mind and, although they emerge for the first time at this stage of his<br>
research, they are constantly considered right up to his last works, for<br>
example in some remarkable pages of the De immenso.</p><p>To investigate the reasons for the recurrence of these issues from both<br>
linguistic and conceptual viewpoints means to face the problem of the<br>
dynamics of Bruno’s ‘mind,’ a task that cannot be accomplished here. In<br>
the context of our line of reasoning, however, some elements can be point-<br>
ed out: First, these subjects, also outlined in De umbris, appear in a text<br>
that, for a long time, has been counted amongst the mnemotechnical works<br>
and implicitly dismissed due to an obsolete idea of Renaissance culture<br>
and philosophy. However, we must drop this misinterpretation if we want<br>
to understand Bruno’s theories, in this particular text and in general.</p><p>This text, in fact, has strong philosophical caliber and is perhaps one of<br>
the most relevant in Bruno’s œuvre. Yet, due to its composite structure, it<br>
also has the important merit of taking us straight into Bruno’s ‘workshop,’<br>
allowing us to both understand the manner in which his texts must be deci-<br>
phered in general and to define (or confirm) at least four specific points.<br>
These include the articulated theoretical basis of his ars, which tackles a<br>
number of gnosiologial, ontological, and ethical issues, evenly introducing<br>
them into the frame of the nova filosofia; the fact that ethico-political and<br>
religious issues are already established in his mnemotechnical works and<br>
destined to find a fuller development in the Spaccio (where the contro -<br>
versy against Puritans becomes central as much as vehement); the possi-<br>
bility, as a consequence, of dating the genesis of Bruno’s first conception<br>
of the Spaccio to the last period of his stay in Paris, though in the frame of<br>
a polemic that, in the Sigillus, is aimed against Protestants as well as<br>
against monastic orders; and, last but not least, the text allows us to figure<br>
out Bruno’s modus operandi.</p><p>Yet, one needs not exaggerate the relation between the Sigillus and the<br>
Spaccio. The persistency of these topics, even if in a short time span,<br>
attests to the continuity of some main themes and also to the incessant<br>
revision to which Bruno subjected his works.<br>

58 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>historians in order to discuss the figure of Giordano Bruno as a ‘thinker<br>
through images.’51 Some fragments of his research are still extant, being<br>
“entrusted to a notebook with a black cover, bearing the title of Giordano<br>
Bruno” and consisting of “45 pages of notes and observations written<br>
between the autumn of 1928 and June 1929, during his stay in Rome with<br>
Gertrude Bing.”52 This material, now made available to scholars,53 is of<br>
extreme interest. However, shortly after writing this letter and embarking<br>
on his project, Warburg passed away and could not accomplish this plan.<br>
Even so, his intuition about ‘thinking through images,’ is still at the center<br>
of the research on Bruno’s philosophy and still represents a necessary<br>
touchstone, on a conceptual as well as historiographical level. The interest<br>
in Bruno’s mnemonics, as attested to by the recent publication of his<br>
mnemotechnical works, arises from a belief similar to that of Warburg.<br>
Better still, it aspires to be the confirmation of the intuition that crossed<br>
Warburg’s mind almost a century ago.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Primary sources <br>

the Nolan undermined traditional positions, by a subtle reflexion on epis-<br>

to secure evidence for his philosophy of the infinite and its inherent con-<br>
sequences which revolutionized the fields of metaphysics and epistemolo-<br>

on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>

Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>

This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to<br>
have worked on Giordano Bruno and his epoch. Their contributions—<br>
inspired by a colloquium on Giordano Bruno organized by the Max Planck<br>
Institute for the History of Science and the Central European University<br>
in 2008—represent a critical inventory of our knowledge of the Nolan’s life<br>
and work as well as shedding light on the many dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
thinking. His radical rationality, starting with attempts to reinvent the<br>
roots of religion but ending with a break in the doctrines of trinity and<br>
monotheism; his natural philosophy, including the cosmology of the infini-<br>
ty of the universe and of the unlimited number of worlds, or his thinking<br>
on the vital character of all the objects on earth; his vision of a new cosmic<br>
order and his place in the Copernican revolution, breaking with the domi-<br>
nant heliocentric and anthropocentric system in a way more radical than<br>
any contemporary thinker had before; his scientific methods, his analogies,<br>
speculations, metaphors, his intuitive as well as practical knowledge,<br>
reflecting the epistemic practices of a revolutionary; his idiosyncratic<br>
blending of traditions, both philosophical and literary; his linguistic exu-<br>
berance and conceptual boldness; the textual structures, genres, and forms<br>
of non-conformity Bruno continuously experimented with, from the trac-<br>
tate to comedy, from dialogue to poetry; and finally, his gusto for paradox<br>
and satirical panache. Attention has also to be given to Bruno’s consider-<br>
ation of the role of philosophy in society—either as a way to give coher-<br>
ence to a world thrown off track, or simply as an instrument for civilizing</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal vii</p><p>viii Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>mankind. This leads us to the reflection and the reception of Bruno’s intel-<br>

The citation comes in a highly specific context: discussing whether or<br>
not the Moon is possessed of an atmosphere. Bruno was, in fact, one of the<br>
first natural philosophers to discuss the Earth’s atmosphere at length,<br>
describing it at one point, with his usual poetic verve, as a lung.13 Since<br>
Bruno saw the universe itself as an infinite system of constantly recombin-<br>
ing atoms, he concluded that the Moon, composed of the same elements as<br>
Earth, should also exhibit the same basic structure, with continents, seas<br>
and an enveloping mantle of air.14</p><p>Kircher’s Itinerarium Extaticum accepted most of these premises in one<br>
form or another; the research by his contemporary Evangelista Torricelli<br>
had gone far toward proving the existence of an atmosphere, and he him-<br>
self was no less convinced than his angel Cosmiel that Earth and heaven<br>
were made of the same basic stuff. Schott bolsters Kircher’s contentions<br>
about the Moon’s atmosphere by naming some of the modern natural<br>
philosophers who agree with him:</p><p>The question, then, is: Does the Moon have an atmosphere, just as<br>
our Earth has one of its own? For many more recent scholars, after<br>
the discovery of the telescope, have identified a layer surrounding<br>
[the Moon] of air or a denser sort of aether, like Kepler, Maestlin,<br>
Galileo, Longomontanus, Giordano Bruno, David Fabricius, Anto nio<br>
Maria de Rheita, Mario Bettini, Langrenius, Wendelin, Johannes<br>
Bapt ista Cysatus, and Scheiner; our Author [that is, Kircher] cited<br>
these last two in his Preface, and agreed with them.15</p><p>Bruno, then, is set comfortably, if somewhat anachronistically, among a<br>
group of modern astronomers (he died before the invention of the tele-<br>
scope). He may not appear explicitly as the Giordano Bruno who pro-<br>
claimed the infinite size of the universe, but no one who read the heretic’s<br>
opinions on the lunar atmosphere could do so without also taking in his<br>
larger ideas, ideas relevant, moreover, to the Iter Extaticum’s later discus-<br>
sions of the size of the universe and panspermia rerum. In effect, both<br>

to prefer the free development of philosophical inquiry to the preservation<br>

made in writing his Itinerarium Extaticum in the first place.<br>

ing point for rethinking Giordano Bruno’s philosophy and his provocative<br>
aspirations in the world of letters. It certainly would have been to Bruno’s<br>
liking; someone who, in his writings, often presented himself as a Mercu ri -<br>
an, larger-than-life figure who has come to put things straight: the No lan,<br>
enlightening his contemporaries about the misleading paths of traditional<br>
doctrines and opening minds for the discovery of true philosophy. </p><p>Born in 1548 near the town of Nola in the Kingdom of Naples, Gior -<br>
dano Bruno is known today as an exceptional, yet ambivalent figure with-<br>
in the history of ideas. As a great scholar, celebrated for his comprehen-<br>
sive erudition, famous for his emphatic defence of philosophical inquiry<br>
against religious doctrine and his rigid attacks against reputed authorities,<br>
he caused an intellectual stir wherever he went. Sometimes his interventi -<br>
ons were received with great éclat; more often, however, they created aca -<br>
de mic scandal. Bruno impressed the French King Henri III who made him<br>
one of his “lecteurs royaux”; three years later, he had to leave Paris in<br>
tumultuous circumstances after a disputation had grown out of control. In<br>
the meantime, Bruno had upset the intellectual scene in Elizabethan<br>
England with his six Italian dialogues. Moving between different frontiers,<br>
confessional beliefs, philosophical schools, academic parties and institu-<br>
tional interests, Bruno—who did not mince matters—came under attack<br>
from many sides. </p><p>Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné<br>
of his time, the Scholastic Aristotelian philosophy that presented a view of<br>
man and cosmos, which Bruno had been dissatisfied with since his time in a<br>
Dominican convent in Naples. For his project of philosophical reform, Bruno<br>
draws on a large variety of sources: on Platonic, pre-Socratic, Py tha   gorean,<br>
and Hermetic ideas, on thinkers such as Plotinus, Averroes, Nicholas of<br>
Cusa, Raimundus Lullus and Ficino. He builds on the metho do  logy, flour-<br>
ishing during the Renaissance, of mnemotechnics. And he uses all these</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 1</p><p>2 Turning Traditions Upside Down<br>

ings—this is the focus of Ingrid Rowland’s essay. Rowland displays how<br>
Giordano Bruno, surprisingly, continued to exert his influence in Catholic<br>
Europe, even in the midst of the Counter-Reformation: half a century<br>
after his death, his name appears in the work of the German-born Jesuit<br>
Athanasius Kircher, clearly unafraid to cite Giordano Bruno openly in his<br>
own publications. Rowland traces Bruno’s subliminal presence in the writ-<br>
ings of this polymath and polygraph, ranging from the structure of the uni-<br>
verse to its small-scale composition and even to mnemonics. How did<br>
Kircher get hold of Bruno’s books? Rowland explains that Jesuits had bet-<br>
ter access than most of their peers to controversial books, e.g., through a<br>
system of internal censorship. Drawing on documents from the archive of<br>
the Jesuit Order in Rome, Rowland is able to show that Kircher and his<br>
fellow Jesuits enjoyed remarkable freedom in philosophical inquiry as the<br>
censors aimed less at doctrinal purity and were more concerned that their<br>
writings could superare mediocritatem, were “exceeding the average.”</p><p>François Quiviger tracks aspects of Bruno’s afterlife in the twentieth-<br>
century from Paris to Rome, Hamburg and London. He starts with a musi-<br>
cal drama about Bruno’s life by a certain Charles Clair, a work that ironi-<br>
cally brought about the excommunication of the author. Quiviger<br>
examines the image of Bruno in fiction and points out that in novels and<br>
dramas, Bruno often is presented as a Christ-like figure. He then follows<br>
the material history of Clair’s book, acquired by Aby Warburg in 1929. In<br>
the last year before his death, Warburg was particularly interested in<br>
Bruno; he hoped that in Bruno’s works he might find a link between pagan<br>
image-based thought and modern symbol-based thought. The material on<br>
Bruno that Warburg had collected but had not been able to exploit,<br>
eventu ally sustained the seminal research of Frances A. Yates at the<br>
Warburg Institute in London, although her perspective on the Nolan dif-<br>
fered completely from Warburg’s.</p><p>The last section of the book, Visibility of the Invisible: About the Sculpture<br>

Sergius Kodera also examines Candelaio in his essay. He uncovers a<br>
line of political thought, an implicit commentary on important historical,<br>
political affairs, running throughout the whole comedy, leading up to<br>
Machiavelli. Although Bruno never even mentions the name of the philo -<br>
sopher-politician from Florence, Kodera detects the subterranean pre sence<br>
of Machiavelli in strategically important passages of Candelaio. He shows</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 7</p><p>8 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>how Bruno adapts the Machiavellian notions of vicissitudo and occasione<br>
and parallels Bruno’s re-evaluation of the sense of touch with Machi a -<br>
velli’s ideas: For both authors, it is hands-on knowledge rather than de -<br>
tached vision that is conducive to true insight and acquisition of power.<br>
Whereas Bruno makes it clear that this re-evaluation involves heavy meta-<br>
physical implications, Machiavelli and Bruno do share common ground<br>
again in their vehement criticism of Christianity as harmful to the commu-<br>
nity.</p><p>This section concludes with Henning Hufnagel’s analysis of Bruno’s<br>
shortest dialogue, Cabala del cavallo pegaseo. Hufnagel focuses on the dia-<br>
logue’s twisted structure. Cabala is one of the most disputed of Bruno’s<br>
texts and scholars have made many attempts to fix a positive theoretical<br>
me aning in the dialogue. Hufnagel shows that this is a hopeless fight<br>
because Bruno blends the dialogue with forms of paradoxical epideixis:<br>
Bruno piles up paradoxes until all claims negate and cancel each other.<br>
Hufnagel proposes Cabala should instead be read as a satire of knowledge.<br>
The transmission of alleged knowledge between the interlocutors collapses<br>
continually and Bruno lays bare their modes of argumentation. If anything<br>
is to be learned from Cabala, it is how the literary form of the dialogue can<br>
acquire the value of an argument. Thus, Cabala can be understood as a<br>
reflection on the dialectical possibilities of the dialogue as a genre.</p><p>In the fourth section in this volume, Reflections of an Intellectual Burning:<br>
Bruno’s Reception and Literary Afterlife, the horizon widens both themat-<br>
ically and temporally. This section looks at some of the traces Bruno’s life<br>
and work left in other philosophical, or even theological contexts, presents<br>
aspects of his sometimes curious literary afterlife—which extends to<br>
Bertolt Brecht and beyond—and tries to come to terms with the truly last-<br>
ing fascination exerted by the man from Nola.</p><p>Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann explores the possibilities of picturing me -<br>
ta  physics by analysing a copper engraving in Heinrich Khunrath’s Amphi -<br>
theatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. In this image, the Kabbalistic foundation of<br>
all being, both the divine and the creatural, is symbolically depicted. For<br>
Bruno, the externalization of the first cause—which is in itself unknow-<br>
able, because it only reveals itself in its expression—is, at the same time,<br>
the beginning of all spatiality. This idea corresponds materially to the<br>
imaging of the first cause, as it is represented in the Leipzig theosopher<br>
Khunrath’s great work Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. He goes beyond<br>
Bruno, however, when he problematizes the question of the symbolism of<br>
the divine externalizations.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 8<br>

Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.<br>

anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.</p><p>Wolfgang Neuser presents an alternative interpretation of Bruno’s the-<br>
ory of matter. Against the backdrop of the controversial medieval debates<br>
about atomism concerning the attributes or qualities of atoms, their cor-<br>
puscular or essential substantiality, and the appreciation of them as dis-<br>
tinct particles, Bruno develops an understanding of matter that merges the<br>
Aristotelian concept of substance with atomistic ideas and the Neo-Pla -<br>
tonic concept of matter, according to which matter is filled with spirit.<br>
Bruno differentiates three manifestations of the metaphysical monad, i.e.,<br>
the undivided, infinite unum that systematically underlies everything.<br>
These manifestations are the constituents of matter: spiritus, based on the<br>
neo-Platonic concept of a spiritual virtue inherent in all matter; spatium,<br>
or the structural explication of the indivisible, un-extended point, which<br>
emerges in a process of self-generation; and atomus, the smallest indivisi-<br>
ble or the physical minimum. Spirit, space, and atom are the structural<br>
modes of the expansion of infinite unity. Based on this conceptualisation<br>
of matter, Neuser characterizes Bruno as a Renaissance philosopher who,<br>
at the end of the post-traditional stage in history, anticipates the subject-<br>
based foundation of knowledge, representative for thinkers from the Mo -<br>
dern Age like Descartes, Spinoza or Leibniz. </p><p>Enrico Giannetto’s chapter emphasizes no less than the astonishing fact<br>
that Giordano Bruno—notwithstanding the significant differences in theo-<br>
retical premises—presents a theory of relativity of time and motion three<br>
hundred years before Poincaré and Einstein. While his non-mechanistic<br>
conception of nature was an obstacle in recognizing Bruno as a serious sci-<br>
entist, according to Giannetto, Bruno’s importance within the history of<br>
theoretical physics is irrefutable. He argues that the relativity of time is<br>
one consequence of Bruno’s concept of cosmic infinity, also entailing the<br>
relativity of the localisation of planets or stars and of their motion, rota-<br>
tion and orbits within a uniform space. Rejecting the Aristotelian assump-<br>
tion of a primum mobile, Bruno argues for the plurality of incommensu-<br>
rable times due to the infinity of uniform motions within the universe.<br>
Turning the Aristotelian doctrine upside down, Bruno regards (relative)<br>
motion as the measure of time.</p><p>Arcangelo Rossi, comparing the cosmological theories of Copernicus,<br>
Bruno, and Galilei, attests a striking correspondence between the Nolan<br>
and the Galilean doctrines. Like Giannetto, Rossi aims at restoring Bru -</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 6</p><p>7<br>

Bruno, then, is set comfortably, if somewhat anachronistically, among a<br>
group of modern astronomers (he died before the invention of the tele-<br>
scope). He may not appear explicitly as the Giordano Bruno who pro-<br>
claimed the infinite size of the universe, but no one who read the heretic’s<br>
opinions on the lunar atmosphere could do so without also taking in his<br>
larger ideas, ideas relevant, moreover, to the Iter Extaticum’s later discus-<br>
sions of the size of the universe and panspermia rerum. In effect, both<br>

to prefer the free development of philosophical inquiry to the preservation<br>
of doctrinal purity, and this was the same decision that Kircher himself had<br>
made in writing his Itinerarium Extaticum in the first place.</p><p>As the vicissitudes of the Iter Extaticum demonstrate, the Society of<br>
Jesus had once stood at the forefront of research in natural philosophy; in<br>
the days when Christoph Clavius and Giordano Bruno were neighbors in<br>
Rome (as they were in 1576) and in the early days of Galileo’s career. By<br>
the middle of the seven teenth century, however, the Fathers were begin-<br>
ning to feel the pressures of its religious restrictions. One way to alleviate<br>
these pressures was to ignore them, as happened to some extent at every<br>
stage in the publication of Kircher’s book on cosmology; Dunel’s mention<br>
of collusion was not out of place. Kircher was also known to publish his<br>
work without ever incorporating the Revisores’ suggestions, further proof<br>
that his status within his order was privileged indeed.16</p><p>Fiction offered another means of escape from the pressures of hewing<br>
to an orthodox line of thought; by putting his ideas about cosmology into<br>
a dream vision, Kircher could argue, along with his Revisores, that the<br>
visions had nothing to do with factual truth. This was simply a more<br>
extreme version of reasoning ex hypothesi, as Galileo had been urged to do<br>
with Copernicus: discussing a controversial idea by insisting that it bore no<br>
relationship to reality.</p><p>Kircher also resorted on many occasions to self-contradiction, making a<br>
doc trinally acceptable point in order to argue its opposite in subsequent dis  -<br>
cussion. This tactic, interestingly, met with particular scorn from the Revi -<br>
sores, one of the proverbial lapses, like his bragging and his failure to in cor -<br>
porate suggestions, for which the Society’s illustrious author was pre  dic tably<br>
accused in every censura—his own complaints about the jealousy of his<br>
peers seem as well-founded as their own complaints about his boasting.17<br>

58 Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary</p><p>historians in order to discuss the figure of Giordano Bruno as a ‘thinker<br>
through images.’51 Some fragments of his research are still extant, being<br>
“entrusted to a notebook with a black cover, bearing the title of Giordano<br>
Bruno” and consisting of “45 pages of notes and observations written<br>
between the autumn of 1928 and June 1929, during his stay in Rome with<br>
Gertrude Bing.”52 This material, now made available to scholars,53 is of<br>
extreme interest. However, shortly after writing this letter and embarking<br>
on his project, Warburg passed away and could not accomplish this plan.<br>
Even so, his intuition about ‘thinking through images,’ is still at the center<br>
of the research on Bruno’s philosophy and still represents a necessary<br>
touchstone, on a conceptual as well as historiographical level. The interest<br>
in Bruno’s mnemonics, as attested to by the recent publication of his<br>
mnemotechnical works, arises from a belief similar to that of Warburg.<br>
Better still, it aspires to be the confirmation of the intuition that crossed<br>
Warburg’s mind almost a century ago.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Primary sources <br>

viii Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>mankind. This leads us to the reflection and the reception of Bruno’s intel-<br>
lectual fire. Bruno has been received in literature and art as well as in pub-<br>
lic spaces in a way that has been as versatile as the philosopher himself.<br>
The sculpture created by Berlin artist Alexander Polzin, entitled Giordano<br>
Bruno, is the subject of the final chapter of this volume. This artwork was<br>
originally commissioned by the Central European University in Budapest<br>
to celebrate George Soros’s seventieth birthday and copies were erected in<br>
Budapest and Nola. On the occasion of our colloquium, the statue was also<br>
inaugurated at Potsdamer Platz in the center of Berlin. The statue depicts<br>
the vulnerable body of a philosopher who is turning the world upside-down<br>
and attempting to dislodge the borders of the universe—a fitting symbol of<br>
Bruno’s tragedy, a man who dared to reconsider the fundamentals of the<br>
world as they had been passed down throughout the ages and who struggled<br>
to find his place in Europe. Yet, after peregrination across the con tin ent, he<br>
ended up cast as a heretic in all three Christian churches of the occident.<br>
He is now honored in a place, at the centre of modern Eu rope, which also<br>
once served as the stage for the tragedy of a world divided. </p><p>We would like to conclude by thanking all the authors who contributed<br>
to this volume. Most of all, we would like to thank the editors, Henning<br>
Hufnagel and Anne Eusterschulte, for their substantial contributions and<br>
the great work they have achieved. We hope that this volume will help cre-<br>
ate a better understanding of a philosopher whose thinking is more preva-<br>
lent today than any of his contemporaries might have foreseen. </p><p>Berlin and Budapest, September 2012 <br>

3</p><p>In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary<br>
thinking upside down, and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as<br>
the theoretical consequences of his thought, the contributions of this vol-<br>
ume all start from a selected text, an exemplary passage drawn from Bru -<br>
no’s great range of work or from texts close to his person and œuvre. Pre -<br>
senting and elucidating pivotal points of the philosophia nolana, the essays<br>
both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy and<br>
provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual<br>
reflections that will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s<br>
works. They reconstruct Bruno’s deconstruction and rearrangement of<br>
phi  lo  sophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his<br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They<br>
ex plore the topics and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and<br>
point out the variance of his reception up to the present, both inside and<br>
outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and continuing<br>
fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>The results of the contributor’s investigations are presented in four sec-<br>
tions, according to four main fields of research interest. The first section<br>
entitled Epistemic Practices of a Revolutionary: Bruno’s Methods and Thin -<br>
king, examines Bruno’s methodological procedures. The essays show how<br>
the Nolan undermined traditional positions, by a subtle reflexion on epis-<br>
temological principles, logical structures, or metaphysical presuppositions,<br>
to secure evidence for his philosophy of the infinite and its inherent con-<br>
sequences which revolutionized the fields of metaphysics and epistemolo-<br>
gy, physics, cosmology and anthropology. Bruno’s method of appropriat-<br>
ing and concatenating older philosophical concepts appears to be both a<br>
method of critical revision as well as systematic transformation.</p><p>Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>

Sergius Kodera also examines Candelaio in his essay. He uncovers a<br>
line of political thought, an implicit commentary on important historical,<br>
political affairs, running throughout the whole comedy, leading up to<br>
Machiavelli. Although Bruno never even mentions the name of the philo -<br>
sopher-politician from Florence, Kodera detects the subterranean pre sence<br>
of Machiavelli in strategically important passages of Candelaio. He shows</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 7</p><p>8 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>how Bruno adapts the Machiavellian notions of vicissitudo and occasione<br>
and parallels Bruno’s re-evaluation of the sense of touch with Machi a -<br>
velli’s ideas: For both authors, it is hands-on knowledge rather than de -<br>
tached vision that is conducive to true insight and acquisition of power.<br>
Whereas Bruno makes it clear that this re-evaluation involves heavy meta-<br>
physical implications, Machiavelli and Bruno do share common ground<br>
again in their vehement criticism of Christianity as harmful to the commu-<br>
nity.</p><p>This section concludes with Henning Hufnagel’s analysis of Bruno’s<br>
shortest dialogue, Cabala del cavallo pegaseo. Hufnagel focuses on the dia-<br>
logue’s twisted structure. Cabala is one of the most disputed of Bruno’s<br>
texts and scholars have made many attempts to fix a positive theoretical<br>
me aning in the dialogue. Hufnagel shows that this is a hopeless fight<br>
because Bruno blends the dialogue with forms of paradoxical epideixis:<br>
Bruno piles up paradoxes until all claims negate and cancel each other.<br>
Hufnagel proposes Cabala should instead be read as a satire of knowledge.<br>
The transmission of alleged knowledge between the interlocutors collapses<br>
continually and Bruno lays bare their modes of argumentation. If anything<br>
is to be learned from Cabala, it is how the literary form of the dialogue can<br>
acquire the value of an argument. Thus, Cabala can be understood as a<br>
reflection on the dialectical possibilities of the dialogue as a genre.</p><p>In the fourth section in this volume, Reflections of an Intellectual Burning:<br>

ically and temporally. This section looks at some of the traces Bruno’s life<br>
and work left in other philosophical, or even theological contexts, presents<br>
aspects of his sometimes curious literary afterlife—which extends to<br>
Bertolt Brecht and beyond—and tries to come to terms with the truly last-<br>
ing fascination exerted by the man from Nola.</p><p>Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann explores the possibilities of picturing me -<br>
ta  physics by analysing a copper engraving in Heinrich Khunrath’s Amphi -<br>
theatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. In this image, the Kabbalistic foundation of<br>
all being, both the divine and the creatural, is symbolically depicted. For<br>
Bruno, the externalization of the first cause—which is in itself unknow-<br>
able, because it only reveals itself in its expression—is, at the same time,<br>
the beginning of all spatiality. This idea corresponds materially to the<br>
imaging of the first cause, as it is represented in the Leipzig theosopher<br>
Khunrath’s great work Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae. He goes beyond<br>
Bruno, however, when he problematizes the question of the symbolism of<br>
the divine externalizations.</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 8<br>

anticipates the cosmological reforms of the seventeenth-century as repre-<br>
sented by Huygens or Newton.</p><p>Wolfgang Neuser presents an alternative interpretation of Bruno’s the-<br>
ory of matter. Against the backdrop of the controversial medieval debates<br>
about atomism concerning the attributes or qualities of atoms, their cor-<br>
puscular or essential substantiality, and the appreciation of them as dis-<br>
tinct particles, Bruno develops an understanding of matter that merges the<br>
Aristotelian concept of substance with atomistic ideas and the Neo-Pla -<br>
tonic concept of matter, according to which matter is filled with spirit.<br>
Bruno differentiates three manifestations of the metaphysical monad, i.e.,<br>
the undivided, infinite unum that systematically underlies everything.<br>
These manifestations are the constituents of matter: spiritus, based on the<br>
neo-Platonic concept of a spiritual virtue inherent in all matter; spatium,<br>
or the structural explication of the indivisible, un-extended point, which<br>
emerges in a process of self-generation; and atomus, the smallest indivisi-<br>
ble or the physical minimum. Spirit, space, and atom are the structural<br>
modes of the expansion of infinite unity. Based on this conceptualisation<br>
of matter, Neuser characterizes Bruno as a Renaissance philosopher who,<br>
at the end of the post-traditional stage in history, anticipates the subject-<br>
based foundation of knowledge, representative for thinkers from the Mo -<br>
dern Age like Descartes, Spinoza or Leibniz. </p><p>Enrico Giannetto’s chapter emphasizes no less than the astonishing fact<br>
that Giordano Bruno—notwithstanding the significant differences in theo-<br>
retical premises—presents a theory of relativity of time and motion three<br>
hundred years before Poincaré and Einstein. While his non-mechanistic<br>
conception of nature was an obstacle in recognizing Bruno as a serious sci-<br>
entist, according to Giannetto, Bruno’s importance within the history of<br>
theoretical physics is irrefutable. He argues that the relativity of time is<br>
one consequence of Bruno’s concept of cosmic infinity, also entailing the<br>
relativity of the localisation of planets or stars and of their motion, rota-<br>
tion and orbits within a uniform space. Rejecting the Aristotelian assump-<br>
tion of a primum mobile, Bruno argues for the plurality of incommensu-<br>
rable times due to the infinity of uniform motions within the universe.<br>
Turning the Aristotelian doctrine upside down, Bruno regards (relative)<br>
motion as the measure of time.</p><p>Arcangelo Rossi, comparing the cosmological theories of Copernicus,<br>
Bruno, and Galilei, attests a striking correspondence between the Nolan<br>
and the Galilean doctrines. Like Giannetto, Rossi aims at restoring Bru -</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 6</p><p>7<br>

This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to<br>
have worked on Giordano Bruno and his epoch. Their contributions—<br>
inspired by a colloquium on Giordano Bruno organized by the Max Planck<br>
Institute for the History of Science and the Central European University<br>
in 2008—represent a critical inventory of our knowledge of the Nolan’s life<br>
and work as well as shedding light on the many dimensions of Bruno’s<br>
thinking. His radical rationality, starting with attempts to reinvent the<br>
roots of religion but ending with a break in the doctrines of trinity and<br>
monotheism; his natural philosophy, including the cosmology of the infini-<br>
ty of the universe and of the unlimited number of worlds, or his thinking<br>
on the vital character of all the objects on earth; his vision of a new cosmic<br>
order and his place in the Copernican revolution, breaking with the domi-<br>
nant heliocentric and anthropocentric system in a way more radical than<br>
any contemporary thinker had before; his scientific methods, his analogies,<br>
speculations, metaphors, his intuitive as well as practical knowledge,<br>
reflecting the epistemic practices of a revolutionary; his idiosyncratic<br>
blending of traditions, both philosophical and literary; his linguistic exu-<br>
berance and conceptual boldness; the textual structures, genres, and forms<br>
of non-conformity Bruno continuously experimented with, from the trac-<br>
tate to comedy, from dialogue to poetry; and finally, his gusto for paradox<br>
and satirical panache. Attention has also to be given to Bruno’s consider-<br>
ation of the role of philosophy in society—either as a way to give coher-<br>
ence to a world thrown off track, or simply as an instrument for civilizing</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal vii</p><p>viii Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>mankind. This leads us to the reflection and the reception of Bruno’s intel-<br>
lectual fire. Bruno has been received in literature and art as well as in pub-<br>
lic spaces in a way that has been as versatile as the philosopher himself.<br>
The sculpture created by Berlin artist Alexander Polzin, entitled Giordano<br>
Bruno, is the subject of the final chapter of this volume. This artwork was<br>
originally commissioned by the Central European University in Budapest<br>
to celebrate George Soros’s seventieth birthday and copies were erected in<br>
Budapest and Nola. On the occasion of our colloquium, the statue was also<br>
inaugurated at Potsdamer Platz in the center of Berlin. The statue depicts<br>
the vulnerable body of a philosopher who is turning the world upside-down<br>
and attempting to dislodge the borders of the universe—a fitting symbol of<br>
Bruno’s tragedy, a man who dared to reconsider the fundamentals of the<br>
world as they had been passed down throughout the ages and who struggled<br>
to find his place in Europe. Yet, after peregrination across the con tin ent, he<br>
ended up cast as a heretic in all three Christian churches of the occident.<br>
He is now honored in a place, at the centre of modern Eu rope, which also<br>
once served as the stage for the tragedy of a world divided. </p><p>We would like to conclude by thanking all the authors who contributed<br>
to this volume. Most of all, we would like to thank the editors, Henning<br>
Hufnagel and Anne Eusterschulte, for their substantial contributions and<br>
the great work they have achieved. We hope that this volume will help cre-<br>
ate a better understanding of a philosopher whose thinking is more preva-<br>
lent today than any of his contemporaries might have foreseen.<br>

Nolan.” Deconstructing the relationship between God and the outside world gave distinction to <br>
his life—and his refusal to recant when facing the stake somehow set him apart from the world. <br>
Since then, the debate about the Nolan has been dominated by the interest in the comprehensive <br>
oeuvre of the philosopher, and by attempts to make him a protagonist of the freedom of thought.</p><p>This volume brings together some of the most eminent researchers to have worked on Giordano <br>
Bruno and his epoch. In order to bring into focus the horizon and the dimensions of his <br>
transformation of traditions, to demonstrate how he turned contemporary thinking upside down, <br>
and to delineate his persuasive strategies, as well as the theoretical consequences of his thought, <br>
the contributions all start from an exemplary passage drawn from Bruno’s great range of work <br>
or from texts close to his person and oeuvre. Presenting and elucidating pivotal points of the <br>
philosophia nolana, the essays both invite readers to become acquainted with Bruno’s philosophy <br>
and provide them with innovative dissections, interpretations and conceptual reflections that <br>
will prepare the way for a revised reading of Bruno’s works. They reconstruct his deconstruction <br>
and rearrangement of philosophical systems, his understanding of nature and the cosmos, his <br>
methods of thinking and writing, his aesthetic and literary categories. They explore the topics <br>
and modi operandi of the great Renaissance thinker and point out the variance of his reception <br>
up to the present, both inside and outside academia, exhibiting the ever-changing relevance and <br>
continuing fascination of Bruno’s work.</p><p>Central European University Press<br>

ing point for rethinking Giordano Bruno’s philosophy and his provocative<br>
aspirations in the world of letters. It certainly would have been to Bruno’s<br>
liking; someone who, in his writings, often presented himself as a Mercu ri -<br>
an, larger-than-life figure who has come to put things straight: the No lan,<br>
enlightening his contemporaries about the misleading paths of traditional<br>
doctrines and opening minds for the discovery of true philosophy. </p><p>Born in 1548 near the town of Nola in the Kingdom of Naples, Gior -<br>
dano Bruno is known today as an exceptional, yet ambivalent figure with-<br>
in the history of ideas. As a great scholar, celebrated for his comprehen-<br>
sive erudition, famous for his emphatic defence of philosophical inquiry<br>
against religious doctrine and his rigid attacks against reputed authorities,<br>
he caused an intellectual stir wherever he went. Sometimes his interventi -<br>
ons were received with great éclat; more often, however, they created aca -<br>
de mic scandal. Bruno impressed the French King Henri III who made him<br>
one of his “lecteurs royaux”; three years later, he had to leave Paris in<br>
tumultuous circumstances after a disputation had grown out of control. In<br>
the meantime, Bruno had upset the intellectual scene in Elizabethan<br>
England with his six Italian dialogues. Moving between different frontiers,<br>
confessional beliefs, philosophical schools, academic parties and institu-<br>
tional interests, Bruno—who did not mince matters—came under attack<br>
from many sides. </p><p>Bruno argued relentlessly for a replacement of the philosophical koiné<br>
of his time, the Scholastic Aristotelian philosophy that presented a view of<br>
man and cosmos, which Bruno had been dissatisfied with since his time in a<br>
Dominican convent in Naples. For his project of philosophical reform, Bruno<br>
draws on a large variety of sources: on Platonic, pre-Socratic, Py tha   gorean,<br>
and Hermetic ideas, on thinkers such as Plotinus, Averroes, Nicholas of<br>
Cusa, Raimundus Lullus and Ficino. He builds on the metho do  logy, flour-<br>
ishing during the Renaissance, of mnemotechnics. And he uses all these</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 1</p><p>2 Turning Traditions Upside Down<br>

Paul Richard Blum opens the volume with an epistemological reflection<br>
on default values, in reference to a passage from Bruno’s Latin poem De<br>
immenso. While default settings are constitutive instruments of every cog-<br>
nitive process—they function as a sort of practical, temporary prejudice—<br>
Blum accentuates Bruno’s request for an epistemic meta-operation. In his<br>
poem, Bruno reminds us to be conscious of the tentativeness of mental de -<br>
fault values in the same way as children are aware of the fact that changing<br>
sights of one and the same object are related to their point of view. If the<br>
in tellect fails to realize the infinity of the universe, it is not the fault of the<br>
visual sense, but of the unconsidered reliance on vision as an epistemic de -<br>
fault value. Bruno advocates a change in the standard principles of thought.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 3</p><p>4 Turning Traditions Upside Down</p><p>This mental operation leads to facing up to a radically altered view of the<br>
world, resulting in the discovery of the philosophy of the infinite.</p><p>Covering Bruno’s so-called Frankfurt Trilogy, Angelika Bönker-Vallon<br>
analyses Bruno’s intention to demonstrate the systematic interrelation<br>
bet ween metaphysical, mathematical and physical thought. In these three<br>
Latin poems, Bruno delineates a universal concept of science which<br>
embraces all branches of scientific knowledge. Within this tripartite ency-<br>
clopaedia, De triplici minimo et mensura is of the utmost significance, as<br>
Bönker-Vallon points out, because in this work Bruno tries to conceptual-<br>
ize a mathematical theory for measuring the infinite cosmos or, in a com-<br>
prehensive sense, to create a theoretical substructure of the encyclopaedic<br>
sciences. Based on the concept of a threefold minimum—i.e., God as the<br>
monad of monads, the mathematical point and the physical atom—Bruno<br>
demonstrates the metaphysical implications and qualities of point and<br>
atom as primary functional minima, redefined as first and elementary spa-<br>
tial structures comprising the coincidental relationship of maximum and<br>
minimum, essential for conceiving the relationship between the infinite<br>
space and its fundamental entities. The interconnection of metaphysical,<br>
mathematical and physical minima provides accessibility to the systematic<br>
nature of Bruno’s threefold theory of the infinite, which based on the idea<br>
of a universal measure, allows for the development of the idea of univer-<br>
sal science.<br>

The last section of the book, Visibility of the Invisible: About the Sculpture<br>
Giordano Bruno by Alexander Polzin [2008], is dedicated to the statue of<br>
Giordano Bruno that was recently erected in Berlin. Besides a description<br>
of the statue and its pendants at Nola and Budapest made by the sculptor,<br>
Alexander Polzin, himself, the author Durs Grünbein gives a poet’s inter-<br>
pretation of the statue at the moment of its unveiling at Potsdamer Platz. He<br>
construes the heretic as an emblematic figure of a young, independent<br>
Europe and asks himself why Berlin—a city which Bruno, this great tra -<br>
veller, has never been to—and, specifically, an underground station could be</p><p>Introduction</p><p>HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:07  Oldal 9</p><p>the right place to commemorate the philosopher from Nola. For Grün bein,<br>
the statue is an iconographic alarm signal, visualizing a rhetoric of fire, the<br>

Divided in four acts, each act subdivided into tableaux, Clair’s musical<br>
focuses on the early and final years of Bruno’s wandering life from Naples<br>
(Act I), to Venice (Acts II &amp; III) and Rome (Act IV). Unlike most histori -<br>
cal fictions, the first edition includes notes with references to a bibliography<br>
of eight monographs on Bruno by Bartholmèss, Kuhlenbeck, McIntyre,<br>
Frith, Berti, Gentile, Brunnofer, and Mariano. The subtitle of the musical,<br>
Le Chevalier errant de la philosophie, originates from Pierre Bayle’s ob ser -<br>
vation that Bruno engaged in philosophical jousting wherever he trav-<br>
elled.3 With Bartholmèss (1847), however, the image of Bruno as a wan-<br>
dering knight alluded not only to his travels, but also to his powerful<br>
imagination and to the chivalrous values of courage and audacity which he<br>
practiced throughout his life and writings—a portrait somehow reminis-<br>

death as a martyr of free-thought. Among the examples collected by<br>
Salvestrini and now present in the Warburg Library are two novels,5 six<br>
plays,6 and two musical dramas composed between the 1870s and 1920s.7</p><p>Although Bruno had, in these years, become an anticlerical rather than<br>
a Catholic hero, his fictional representations included numerous Christo -<br>
logical allusions,8 ranging from the scene of betrayal which authors attri -<br>
bute to various Judas-like figures—Mocenigo or an old friend or a disciple<br>
jealous of his fiancée’s affection for the philosopher—to his last moments.<br>
Sometimes the words of Christ are placed in Bruno’s mouth. Bruno’s pan-<br>
theism, a recurring theme of nineteenth-century scholarship—ex pres sed<br>
through a hymn to nature in Clair’s drama—also features prominently.</p><p>Bruno’s martyrdom began in the inquisition jails. Like most authors,<br>
Clair assumed that Bruno was tortured. Interrogated by the Pope, Bruno<br>
points out that nine years of torture have not weakened his faith and that<br>
he even prefers death to the dignity of the cardinal’s position.9 Other<br>
plays, such as that of José Fola Igúrbide, feature entire scenes taking place<br>
in the Inquisitional torture chamber.10 Scheffer’s novel also alludes to tor-<br>
ture, but best of all is Davide Levi, who quoted passages from the Furori<br>
Eroici to describe Bruno’s state of mind during torture sessions.11</p><p>In this context, and to anyone remotely familiar with the image of<br>
Bruno in Risorgimento Italy, the first edition of Charles Clair’s drama be -<br>
gins with a singular piece of earnest wishful thinking. It is a letter to Pope<br>
Pius X, dated July 13, 1913, written from a luxury hotel near Lugano<br>
(Stella d’Italia, San Mamette), in which the author apologizes for delays in<br>
sending him his text. Clair writes that it is a question of Truth, a question<br>
of rehabilitating a man so calumniated by the sixteenth century. The letter<br>
appears in the first edition in French and Italian versions. In the second<br>
edition, it features only in French.<br>

HUFNAGEL.nyomdai.imprimált.:...  2.4.2013  14:09  Oldal 238</p><p>239</p><p>Charles Clair published his Giordano Bruno ou le Chevalier errant de la<br>
philosophie twice. The first edition is the princeps of 1914. The copy of the<br>
second edition, kept in the Warburg Library and dated 1925, is a num-<br>
bered copy—No. 297—printed for Virgilio Salvestrini and signed and ded-<br>
icated by the author. The second edition also contains a preface by Paul<br>
Fort (1872–1960). Paul Fort was a friend of the author—at least, since<br>
1914—as suggested by a copy of his Nocturnes (1914) which recently sur-<br>
faced on the market. It bears a dedication to Clair. Paul Fort was also one<br>
of the most important poets of his time, as well the founder and director of<br>
the review Vers et Prose, which published such luminaries as Rimbaud,<br>
Verlaine, Mallarmé, Lautréamont, and Guillaume Apollinaire. His avant-<br>
propos to Clair’s Giordano Bruno thus stands out as a strong and eloquent<br>
endorsement from a respected and charismatic figure of French Letters.</p><p>Hardly anything is known of Charles Clair outside the evidence pro-<br>
vided by these two editions. He is absent from the Dictionnaire de Bio -<br>
graphi es Françaises and all musical and literary bibliographies I have con-<br>
sulted. His Giordano Bruno is the only work he ever published. No score<br>
accompanies the text, and no evidence has yet surfaced to confirm whether<br>
his musical drama was ever performed. Library catalogues sometimes con-<br>
fuse our author with a Jesuit priest who lived between 1835 and 1899, and<br>
who wrote on religion and religious art—an unlikely candidate for the<br>
authorship of a musical drama on Giordano Bruno. Our Charles Clair held<br>
the Ancient-Régime title of Comm. Visconte, with which he signed the let-<br>
ter to the Pope accompanying his text. There he refers to the favors his<br>
family has received from Pope Pius X and alludes to a telegram he had<br>
already sent from Bordighera in 1912, announcing the imminent comple-<br>
tion of the text.2</p><p>Divided in four acts, each act subdivided into tableaux, Clair’s musical<br>
focuses on the early and final years of Bruno’s wandering life from Naples<br>
(Act I), to Venice (Acts II &amp; III) and Rome (Act IV). Unlike most histori -<br>

or, more recently, Rowland, Giordano Bruno. For a concise recent summary of<br>
research on Bruno, see Saiber, Geometry, 9–12. For a summary and analysis of the<br>
Candelaio, see Moliterno, “Introduction,” in Bruno, Candle-bearer, 9–49; and Kodera,<br>
“Einleitung zum Candelaio,” VII–LV. </p><p>3 Most notably perhaps is Pietro Aretino’s Cortigiana. (See also note 6 below.)<br>
4 Ordine, Soglia, 45; cf. also Ciliberto, Bruno, 25.<br>
5 On Bruno’s art of memory, see Sturlese, “Per un’interpretazione”; Clucas, “De</p><p>imaginum”; and Clucas, “Simulacra.”<br>
6 With the possible exception of Aretino’s Cortigiana. Messer Maco, a painter from</p><p>Venice, was actually a friend of Aretino’s. Boccaccio’s Decameron (VII, 3 and 6; IX,<br>
3 and 5) recounts delightful stories about the beffe that were played to Calandrino,<br>
a simpleton and painter, by Bruno and Buffalmaco, two clever Florentine artists and<br>
historical figures. </p><p>7 As stated by the title page.<br>
8 This is a plot of ancient Indian origins which was well known in Italy at least since</p><p>the Decameron, cf. Doninger, The Bedtrick, 30 and passim. This trick also figures in<br>
Bibbiena’s Calandria. Kodera, “Einleitung zum Candelaio,” XXXII–XXXVI, argues<br>
that this scene can be read as an enactment of Bruno’s doctrine of shadows and a<br>
parody of the Platonic myth of the cave. See also Kodera, “Un fallo.” </p><p>9 Bruno frequently fails to name authors with whom he has an intellectual affinity.<br>
Granada, Universo infinito, 179 (with many references) has shown that when Bruno<br>
mentions authors such as Ficino, Nicholas of Cusa, or Copernicus, then this is often<br>
indicative of both a dependence and an intellectual rupture with the author in ques-<br>
tion. The entire chapter of Granada’s book (169–96) is a valuable introduction to the<br>
relationship between Bruno and Machiavelli. See also Ordine, “Teatro e conoscen-<br>
za,” 532sq. On the presence of Machiavelli in Bruno’s Cabala, see Kodera, “Ein -<br>
leitung zur Cabala,” LXXXVIIIsqq. </p><p>10 “Notwithstanding that what I enjoyed tonight had not been given to me by the gods<br>
or nature and had been denied to me by Fortune, judgement made me recognise the<br>
opportunity, diligence made me grab it by the hair, and perseverance allowed me to<br>
hold it fast” (V, 19; Bruno, Candle-bearer, 177, modi fied).<br>

The citation comes in a highly specific context: discussing whether or<br>
not the Moon is possessed of an atmosphere. Bruno was, in fact, one of the<br>
first natural philosophers to discuss the Earth’s atmosphere at length,<br>
describing it at one point, with his usual poetic verve, as a lung.13 Since<br>
Bruno saw the universe itself as an infinite system of constantly recombin-<br>
ing atoms, he concluded that the Moon, composed of the same elements as<br>
Earth, should also exhibit the same basic structure, with continents, seas<br>
and an enveloping mantle of air.14</p><p>Kircher’s Itinerarium Extaticum accepted most of these premises in one<br>
form or another; the research by his contemporary Evangelista Torricelli<br>
had gone far toward proving the existence of an atmosphere, and he him-<br>
self was no less convinced than his angel Cosmiel that Earth and heaven<br>
were made of the same basic stuff. Schott bolsters Kircher’s contentions<br>
about the Moon’s atmosphere by naming some of the modern natural<br>
philosophers who agree with him:</p><p>The question, then, is: Does the Moon have an atmosphere, just as<br>
our Earth has one of its own? For many more recent scholars, after<br>
the discovery of the telescope, have identified a layer surrounding<br>
[the Moon] of air or a denser sort of aether, like Kepler, Maestlin,<br>
Galileo, Longomontanus, Giordano Bruno, David Fabricius, Anto nio<br>
Maria de Rheita, Mario Bettini, Langrenius, Wendelin, Johannes<br>
Bapt ista Cysatus, and Scheiner; our Author [that is, Kircher] cited<br>
these last two in his Preface, and agreed with them.15</p><p>Bruno, then, is set comfortably, if somewhat anachronistically, among a<br>
group of modern astronomers (he died before the invention of the tele-<br>
scope). He may not appear explicitly as the Giordano Bruno who pro-<br>
claimed the infinite size of the universe, but no one who read the heretic’s<br>
opinions on the lunar atmosphere could do so without also taking in his<br>
larger ideas, ideas relevant, moreover, to the Iter Extaticum’s later discus-<br>
sions of the size of the universe and panspermia rerum. In effect, both<br>

to prefer the free development of philosophical inquiry to the preservation<br>
of doctrinal purity, and this was the same decision that Kircher himself had<br>
made in writing his Itinerarium Extaticum in the first place.<br>
