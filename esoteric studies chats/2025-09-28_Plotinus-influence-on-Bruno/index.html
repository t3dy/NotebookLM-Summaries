syncretic, eclectic and pluralist nature of Brunian thought. ere is less stress on<br>
grounding Bruno’s philosophy in a single philosophical outlook, but rather an emphasis<br>
on his diverse strategies of intellectual filiation. Karen De León-Jones, for instance, in<br>
her recent book, Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah, sees Bruno as an ‘example of<br>
Renaissance syncretism at its most extreme’. In reality, she says, ‘Bruno is Bruno; he<br>
proselytizes his own philosophy’. De León-Jones is correct, I believe, to suggest that it is<br>
reductive to ‘limit the Nolan philosophy by labelling it according to pre-established<br>
categories convenient to solars of the Renaissance su as “Hermeticist”, “Kabbalist”</p><p>or “Neoplatonist”’.104 Leen Spruit also places particular emphasis on Bruno’s<br>
eclecticism, comparing his strategies (and their aendant problems) to those of that</p><p>other great Renaissance syncretist, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola.105 Spruit sees<br>

Leibniz’s sources here have been the subject of speculation. Bruno is an unlikely<br>
source since Leibniz was not familiar with the relevant works as early as 1671. His use<br>
of the term ‘Kern’ in the writings on the resurrection of the body of 1671 has been<br>
linked with the monadological doctrine of J.B. van Helmont and indirectly with that of</p><p>Augustine,85 according to whi God in the beginning scaered the invisible seeds of<br>
all things. Leibniz was content, mu later, to claim that his reasoning about all brute<br>
souls being created at one time ‘agrees well with the Holy Scriptures, whi suggest</p><p>that there were seeds (semences) in the beginning’.86 But it is possible that his earlier<br>
view derives from Augustine’s interpretation of Genesis, perhaps mediated by J.B. van</p><p>Helmont.87 It may be, then, that he was already disposed to hold that the ‘hidden seeds<br>
of all things that are born corporeally and visibly are concealed in the corporeal<br>
elements of this world’, the hidden seeds being created at the beginning by God</p><p>himself.88</p><p>Leibniz’s early theories of how the resurrection is possible are linked with his<br>
constantly repeated doctrine that there is something indestructible about all living<br>
things and that, strictly speaking, there is no su thing as death – nor, for that maer,<br>
is there su a thing, strictly speaking, as birth. But though his views converge with<br>
those of Bruno at this point, I do not think they derived from his distinguished<br>
predecessor.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I have concentrated in this apter on aspects of Leibniz’s early monadology that are, I<br>
believe, common to the later philosophy. On many of the points where the later<br>
philosophy is at least ostensibly different, it is the younger Leibniz who is closer to<br>
Bruno. He was closer to pantheism and determinism, indeed Spinozism, than he sought</p><p>to be and believed he succeeded in being in his mature philosophy.89 He was still</p><p>willing to defend, albeit residually, some form of atomism.90 ere are, as I have tried<br>
to bring out, many points of similarity between the doctrines of the two philosophers.<br>
e explanations for those similarities are various. Very lile that I can discover is due</p><p>to the direct influence of Bruno. But Bruno was a contributory and indirect influence on<br>
the young Leibniz both because of his influence on the Herborn sool and because of<br>
his influence on earlier Modern philosophers. Perhaps the most important explanation<br>
for the similarities between Bruno and the young Leibniz, however, is due to their both<br>
belonging to a common intellectual tradition, in whi ideas stemming ultimately from<br>
Pythagoras, Plato and Plotinus were taken for granted: ideas su as the perfection,<br>
harmony and plenitude of the world: ideas su as that a true being is simple and<br>
irreducible. Bruno anticipated the Moderns in a number of his preoccupations, as<br>
Leibniz saw it, with his revival of Democritus and his advocacy of an infinite universe,<br>
as well as his interest in the deeper mathematics. He no doubt influenced, at least to<br>
some extent, the intellectual culture of modern philosophy in these respects.<br>

applicable to the De umbris idearum.’95</p><p>is seems to me directly to contradict the agential dimension of the De umbris with<br>
its insistence on transformatio as the ultimate objective of the Plotinian programme. To<br>
reduce the mnemonic works to an ‘epistemological problematic’ is to reduce the<br>
complexity of the practices (logical, gnostic, religious and magical) whi they imply to<br>
the level of mere theory. Compare, for example, his insistence in the Triginta Sigilli</p><p>that ‘art is not consummated in discourse’ but ‘perfects itself in the moment in whi it</p><p>is connected to a natural agent’,96 and his statement towards the end of his discussion<br>
of magia where he says that by ‘the emulation of omnipotent nature’ (naturae</p><p>cunctipotentis aemula), magic can become its ‘director and governess’ (directrix et</p><p>gubernatrix).97 For Bruno, to understand the universe – whi was the aim of the<br>
mnemonic system – was to act upon it.</p><p>While Spruit, Rossi and Vasoli all give clearer-sighted accounts of Brunian<br>
mnemonics and its intellectual context than Yates, there are moments of overlap where</p><p>she does seem to be aware of Bruno’s encyclopaedic theory of knowledge,98 but<br>
distorts these insights by diverting them into arguments about the talismanic<br>
annelling of astral influences, conjuration and the primary importance of<br>
Hermeticism, all of whi suffer from a la of textual evidence to support them.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to suggest that the fruitful development of Brunian<br>
mnemonics aer Yates’s pioneering speculations, have all indicated a need to take<br>
account of the profoundly eclectic nature of Bruno’s philosophy as a synthesis. I do not<br>
mean to argue here, for example, that we must simply recategorize Bruno as a<br>
‘Plotinian’ rather than a ‘Hermetic’ philosopher or magus. at would be a rather<br>

Bruno and Lull, as well as Cusanus, were<br>
mediated to Leibniz as part of a particular Platonist tradition carried forward by a<br>
group known as the Herborn encyclopaedists. Some of the striking similarities between<br>
Bruno and Leibniz are, I try to show, due to the fact that they belonged to this same<br>
tradition and therefore not only shared some very important presuppositions but also<br>
drew some of the same conclusions from them. I consider, in particular, two<br>
assumptions that are important for both Bruno and Leibniz, as well as others in this<br>
tradition: first, that the universe, being the work of a perfect Creator, is itself perfect;<br>
and, second, that the world is composed fundamentally of indivisibles whi are<br>
therefore indestructible. e first of these assumptions, whi I refer to as ‘the principle<br>
of perfection’, is full of implications for the nature of the world. In the fih section I<br>
look at the way in whi Leibniz developed the implications of the principle for the<br>
harmony of the universe, making comparisons with both Bruno and Cusanus. In the<br>
sixth section I consider the inferences Bruno and Leibniz drew from the Principle of<br>
Perfection for their views on plenitude and the infinite. Finally, I look at some of the<br>
aracteristics of their monads, in particular their view that there are fundamental<br>
entities whi underlie the transient world and whi endure despite the constant<br>
anges material things undergo.</p><p>It will be evident that I do not think there is a single answer to the question about<br>
the connection between Bruno and Leibniz. ere may be some direct influence of<br>
Bruno on Leibniz. ere is probably more indirect influence. But, as I argue, the main<br>
reason for the similarities between the two philosophers is their debt to common<br>
sources and their membership of a common philosophical tradition.</p><p>e Debate about Bruno’s Influence on Leibniz</p><p>In the late nineteenth century many claims were made about Leibniz’s sources and</p><p>Bruno was only one of several candidates7 whose claims to being a key influence on<br>
Leibniz’s philosophy were being canvassed by solars. One of these was Hermann<br>
Brunnhofer, who noted that many of Leibniz’s distinctive monadological doctrines are</p><p>also to be found in Bruno.8 Brunnhofer was particularly concerned to show that Leibniz<br>
derived his doctrine that monads have no windows from various casual remarks by<br>
Bruno.</p><p>Brunnhofer assumed, in his arguments, that Leibniz was thoroughly versed in<br>
Bruno’s writings. is assumption was disputed by Ludwig Stein (1890). Against<br>
Brunnhofer, Stein argued that, prior to 1700, Leibniz’s knowledge of Bruno was very<br>
limited, confined to a book on Lull and perhaps some of his mathematical writings.<br>
Stein, I think, went too far the other way. But he was right to raise the question as to<br>

However, just as Diana’s headlong arges through the Forest of Maer represent only</p><p>partial enlightenment for Egidio da Viterbo, so the figure of Actaeon, even resurrected,</p><p>expresses only imperfect enlightenment for Giordano Bruno – as indeed he did for</p><p>Egidio in the ‘Caccia Bellissima dell’Amore’. e real transformation of the individual</p><p>from mortality to divinity takes place instead by a riverside, where in Egidio’s</p><p>Sententiae as in the Eroici Furori the baptismal sprinkling with divine waters presages</p><p>the mystical union with a transcendental beloved, described in both contexts in</p><p>language profoundly shaped by the Song of Songs. e river in Egidio’s Sententiae can</p><p>only be the Jordan. For the Nine Blind Men of the Eroici Furori it is the ames, but it</p><p>is, of course, also the great river of Giordano’s eloquence.</p><p>What we definitely know about Giordano Bruno and Neoplatonism in Naples are the</p><p>following facts: that a very young Filippo Bruno went to learn logic from the</p><p>Augustinian friar Teofilo da Vairano, and that Teofilo’s impact on his pupil went beyond</p><p>simple instruction in logic, that this hypercritical philosopher regarded Teofilo as ‘his</p><p>greatest master in philosophy’. We know in addition that Bruno’s own idea of</p><p>philosophy owed so profound a debt to Marsilio Ficino that he was accused of outright</p><p>plagiarism when be began to lecture at Oxford on a philosophy that Giordano himself</p><p>regarded as Nolan. e riest hoard of Ficinian texts in Naples was gathered in the</p><p>Seripando collection that formed a special jewel within the Augustinian library of San</p><p>Giovanni a Carbonara. We cannot as yet place Giordano Bruno firmly within that</p><p>library. Instead we must perform the same action that Marsilio Ficino develops from his</p><p>own readings of Plato: traing, vestigatio, looking for tell-tale traces that allow us to</p><p>re-create a more full idea about the real object of our pursuit.</p><p>And here the most striking traces are those le in Bruno’s writings on the one hand</p><p>and the writings of Egidio da Viterbo on the other. at Teofilo da Vairano was himself</p><p>a visionary Neoplatonist in the Ficinian mold cannot be established from his one</p><p>surviving treatise, De Gratia Novi Testamenti (On the Grace of the New Testament)<br>
although there are tantalizing suggestions that he was a radical thinker in his own right.</p><p>e parallels between Bruno and Egidio da Viterbo appear most pointedly in De umbris<br>
idearum and in his Italian dialogues, especially the Eroici Furori, works in whi the</p><p>Nolan philosopher’s debt to Neoplatonism is particularly evident. e commanding</p><p>influence of Marsilio Ficino, of course, was so clear that Giordano stood accused of</p><p>plagiarism in Oxford. But there are also types of imagery that Ficino explored only</p><p>superficially, whereas Egidio pursued them in depth, and so, in his turn, did the Nolan.</p><p>Perhaps the quality that most profoundly links Egidio da Viterbo to Giordano Bruno</p><p>is the sheer ravening intensity of their quest for God, a quest they both gladly liken to<br>

Yates, who in The Art of Memory and Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition</p><p>pursued a sustained and serious investigation of Brunian mnemonics whi had, up to<br>
that point, received scant aention from intellectual historians despite the publication</p><p>of Tocco’s monumental edition of the Latin works in the 1880s.2</p><p>Yates made Brunian mnemonics a centrepiece of her influential study of the<br>
‘Hermetic tradition’ in the Renaissance, arguing that Bruno had transformed the<br>
mnemotenic theories of the pseudo-Ciceronian Ad Herennium, and the medieval<br>
tradition whi arose from it, into a ‘magical … Hermetic art’, deriving directly from<br>
the Hermetic motif of ‘reflecting the universe in the mind’. ‘It was now understood’, she<br>
argued, ‘as a method of printing basic or aretypal images on the memory, with the<br>
cosmic order itself as the “place” system, a kind of inner way of knowing the</p><p>universe.’3</p><p>Developing an idea alluded to by Eugenio Garin, she argued that Bruno’s first</p><p>surviving work on the art of memory,4 De umbris idearum, published in Paris in 1582,5</p><p>was a magical memory art ‘about a very strong solar magic’ derived from Marsilio<br>
Ficino’s De vita coelitus comparanda, although apparently ‘making no direct quotations</p><p>from it’ and ‘alluding’ to it ‘in a confused way’.6 Realizing that the long descriptions of<br>
astrological and mythological images given in the work were designed to be used in<br>
conjunction with the Lullist wheels, Yates set about proving how these figures were<br>
functioning as talismans, that is to say ‘images designed to obtain universally</p><p>favourable influences’ from the planets.7 In particular, she noted Bruno’s selection of a<br>
group of astrological images, including the signs of the zodiac and ‘the images of the<br>
Egyptian decan demons’, taken directly from Henricus Cornelius Agrippa’s De occulta</p><p>philosophia.8</p><p>11.1  Handwrien dedication to Alexander Dicson in Bruno’s first work on the art of<br>

it.78 e shadow is, in fact, an act of benevolence, or solicitude on the part of the<br>
Divinity: ‘By means of the Shadow the Divinity tempers and offers the nuncial species</p><p>of things to the dim-sighted eye of the hungry and thirsty soul.’79</p><p>is benevolence of divinity towards mortals is mated by a gnostic elevation of<br>
the soul whi takes up this offer. To ascend to the One through the shadows of ideas, is<br>
to transform and elevate the soul to a superior state; it is ‘raised above the height of</p><p>bodies into the proximity of the intelligences’.80 In discussing the various kinds of<br>
aitude towards the sciences in Antiquity, Bruno notes that the peripatetic philosophy<br>
based its beliefs upon undemonstrable things (de non demonstrabilibus), while the<br>
Pythagoreans based theirs upon undemonstrated things (de non demonstratis). e</p><p>Platonists, he said, based their philosophy upon both of these kinds of principle.81 It is<br>
perhaps in this light that we should view Bruno’s own philosophy: as a kind of Platonic<br>
science (or scientia). us, while he insists that ‘we must progress through a natural and</p><p>rational course towards the explication of forms’,82 the final objective of this progress</p><p>is to trace the analogical series of a ‘divine and natural order’ through the mind.83 An<br>
important model for Bruno’s ‘Platonic science’ at this point is Plotinus’s Enneades, as</p><p>mediated by Marsilio Ficino’s In Plotini Enneades commentatio.84 ‘Plotinus<br>
understood’, Bruno says,</p><p>that the ladder through whi we rise to the principle is composed of seven<br>
steps (to whi we add two further steps); of these the first is the purgation of<br>
the soul, the second is aention, the third intention, the fourth contemplation of<br>
order, the fih the proportional comparison [of things] from [that] order, the<br>
sixth negation or separation, the seventh prayer, the eighth the transformation<br>
of oneself into the thing, the ninth, the transformation of the thing into<br>
oneself.85</p><p>If one were looking for a philosophical ‘key’ to the De umbris idearum, it is surely to<br>
this passage that one would look. Rather than an ‘Egyptian revelation’, one would find<br>
a Plotinian magic – if one wishes to construe the ‘transformation of the thing into<br>
oneself’ as ‘magic’. e transformative power of imagination was a constant theme of<br>
Renaissance magic, and while Bruno’s system does not contain references to the<br>
talismanic instruments or conjurations referred to by Yates, it can still be construed as<br>
magical, albeit a Plotinian rather than a Hermetic magic. It was a magic whi wedded<br>
itself to the Lullian synthesis of logic and metaphysics, to pseudo-Ciceronian<br>
mnemotenics (appropriating the idea of the striking memory image to the<br>
metaphysical idea of a universal structure of analogous similitudes), to religious<br>
practices (purgation and prayer), and supported its claims with a wealth of<br>
subordinated (or mediating) references to the Cabbala, Pythagoreanism and<br>
Aristotelianism.</p><p>So, as Yates once asked, ‘How did the system work?’86 I would suggest that the Ars<br>

the imagination to the stars, or reproducing the celestial world within’.16 e planetary</p><p>‘influences’, Yates believed, were ‘imprinted on memory through magic images’,17 and<br>
‘arranging or manipulating’ the images would allow the practitioner of the art to ‘act</p><p>on the inferior world, ange the stellar influences on it’,18 the images were, in fact,</p><p>‘transmiers of … astral forces’.19 At another juncture, on a sudden inspiration, Yates<br>
declared that she was ‘inclined to think’ that the reason for Bruno’s oice of divisions<br>
of 30 in his groups of images, had its source in Trithemius’ Steganographia ‘in whi<br>
thirty-one spirits are listed with recipes for conjuring them’. is leads directly to<br>
another speculation that Bruno’s lost mnemotenical work, the Clavis Magna ‘might<br>
have explained how to use Lullian wheels as conjuring for summoning the spirits of the<br>
air’. His Lullian devices are, thus, seen as ‘“practical Cabala” or conjuring for reaing</p><p>the demons, or angels, beyond the stars’.20</p><p>Using her analysis of De umbris idearum as a foundation, Yates proceeded to judge<br>
Bruno’s later mnemotenical writings using the same yardsti. us she sees the<br>
Triginta Sigilli as an ‘astrologized and magicized classical art of memory’, whi was</p><p>‘galvanized … through being affiliated to astral systems’.21 Bruno’s art was to be used</p><p>to ‘get inside the astrological system’;22 in this work ‘the exercises in Hermetic</p><p>mnemonics have become the spiritual exercises of a religion’,23 ‘part of a Hermetic</p><p>mystery cult’.24 She sees Bruno’s final work, De imaginum, signorum et idearum</p><p>compositione, as something of a departure in tenical terms, especially in its</p><p>‘elaboration of pseudo-mathematical, or “mathesistical”, place systems’.25 Where the<br>
earlier mnemonic systems had capitalized on the Lullian wheel, the De imaginum</p><p>focused on the ‘aritectural memory system’ whi was the mainstay of the Pseudo-<br>
Ciceronian memory art, although Yates adds, ‘Bruno is using it in a highly abnormal<br>
way in whi the distribution of the rooms is involved with magical geometry and the</p><p>system is worked from above by celestial meanics’.26 While she speculates briefly on<br>
the encyclopaedic nature of Bruno’s memory art and the possibility that it was a</p><p>‘memory code’ used by a secret society,27 her primary theme is still that Ficinian</p><p>talismanic magic is the basis of the system.28</p><p>We will look more closely at Bruno’s texts later, but a number of points are worth<br>
making now. First, Yates consistently de-emphasizes the diversity of Bruno’s sources in</p><p>order to present his mnemonic works as Hermetic: ‘Bruno’s philosophy’,29 Yates<br>
insisted, ‘was the Hermetic philosophy’. Brushing aside views whi suggested that the</p><p>De umbris was ‘some kind of Neoplatonic mysticism’,30 or down-playing the influence</p><p>of Plotinus on that work (in whi Bruno refers to him as Platonicorum princeps)31 by<br>

Bruno, and to act as the youth’s ‘greatest master in philosophy’, that philosophy’s</p><p>Neoplatonic aspects must surely have been shaped by the leading Augustinian</p><p>exponent of Christian Neoplatonism, by Egidio da Viterbo in addition to Egidio’s own</p><p>inspiration, Marsilio Ficino. e possible traces of su influence in Naples are easy to</p><p>spot, in manuscripts that come largely from the special reading room endowed by the</p><p>Seripando family for the Augustinian congregation at San Giovanni a Carbonara.33 e</p><p>originator of this library within a library was Girolamo Seripando himself; when he</p><p>moved to Rome to take up his position as Prior General of the order, responsibility for</p><p>the reading room passed to his brother Antonio. To this important collection, Teofilo da</p><p>Vairano would certainly have had access. Filippo or Giordano Bruno may have as well.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking resemblance between Teofilo da Vairano and Egidio da</p><p>Viterbo lies in their aitude towards the Jews: Egidio kept a rabbi in his house to tea</p><p>him Hebrew and, like Teofilo aer him, anowledged the validity of the Jews’</p><p>covenant with God. Both, to be sure, embraced their Jewish brethren as devout</p><p>Christians, convinced that the Messiah had already come to Judaea in the reigns of</p><p>Augustus and Tiberius Caesar, but they were respectful of their brethren in the faith –</p><p>and indeed of all others. Egidio preaed Crusade by papal request, but he read Arabic</p><p>solars. So did Teofilo da Vairano.</p><p>More elusive, yet more striking, are the parallels between Egidio da Viterbo and</p><p>Giordano Bruno. e Nolan’s encounter with philosophy occurred when he, with his</p><p>extraordinary memory and his brilliant visual imagination, was still a very young man,</p><p>at that time of life when both memory and sensory impressions are stimulated and</p><p>preserved with especial intensity, and critical faculties are in their infancy. Whatever</p><p>Egidio da Viterbo’s shortcomings as a philosopher may have been, and they were</p><p>many, his ability to create imagery in words, refined by his own immersion in the</p><p>classical art of memory, was an ability of the very highest order.34 He could give</p><p>imaginative form to philosophical abstractions with almost unparalleled success in his</p><p>own day, and this skill made his career as a preaer, as well as supplying definite</p><p>impetus to the development of the visual arts in sixteenth-century Italy.35 Like</p><p>Raphael’s exactly contemporary frescos in the pope’s private library, the School of<br>
Athens, Parnassus, Disputa del Sacramento and Wall of Justice, Egidio da Viterbo could</p><p>transform ideas and words into human figures, or as Frances Yates said of the School of</p><p>Athens, into very gods.36</p><p>e Giordano Bruno we know from the early 1580s, the author of works ranging</p><p>from De umbris idearum, wrien in Paris in 1582, to De gli heroici furori, penned in</p><p>England three years later, owes an evident debt to Ficino for his Neoplatonic</p><p>formulations. e story of Bruno’s alleged plagiarism of Ficino at Oxford in 1584 offers</p><p>telling proof of how closely the Nolan philosopher modelled his own thinking upon<br>

It will be evident that I do not think there is a single answer to the question about<br>
the connection between Bruno and Leibniz. ere may be some direct influence of<br>
Bruno on Leibniz. ere is probably more indirect influence. But, as I argue, the main<br>
reason for the similarities between the two philosophers is their debt to common<br>
sources and their membership of a common philosophical tradition.</p><p>e Debate about Bruno’s Influence on Leibniz</p><p>In the late nineteenth century many claims were made about Leibniz’s sources and</p><p>Bruno was only one of several candidates7 whose claims to being a key influence on<br>
Leibniz’s philosophy were being canvassed by solars. One of these was Hermann<br>
Brunnhofer, who noted that many of Leibniz’s distinctive monadological doctrines are</p><p>also to be found in Bruno.8 Brunnhofer was particularly concerned to show that Leibniz<br>
derived his doctrine that monads have no windows from various casual remarks by<br>
Bruno.</p><p>Brunnhofer assumed, in his arguments, that Leibniz was thoroughly versed in<br>
Bruno’s writings. is assumption was disputed by Ludwig Stein (1890). Against<br>
Brunnhofer, Stein argued that, prior to 1700, Leibniz’s knowledge of Bruno was very<br>
limited, confined to a book on Lull and perhaps some of his mathematical writings.<br>
Stein, I think, went too far the other way. But he was right to raise the question as to</p><p>how mu Leibniz actually knew of Bruno’s writings.9 Stein was stru by a blunder<br>
Leibniz made in leers to Lacroze and John Toland, in whi his knowledge of Bruno<br>
emerges as very limited indeed. is is particularly noticeable in a leer of April 1709,<br>
to Toland, where he seems to be parading as mu of his knowledge of Bruno as he can<br>
muster:</p><p>I have at some time read the two works10 – one in Latin, the other in Italian –<br>
whi Giordano Bruno has published on the universe and the infinite. ey<br>
show this author was not laing in penetration. But unhappily he went beyond<br>
the just limits of reason. He also went in for the imeras of the art of Raymond<br>
Lull. I have never read his Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante. I have the<br>
impression that someone spoke to me about it once in France, but I cannot be<br>
sure – it was a long time ago. Should one not say Specchio rather than Spaccio?<br>
Mr Lacroze tells me that you have shown him this book.11</p><p>is passage was taken by Stein, and has been taken by a number of solars since, to</p><p>show that Leibniz was far from being well versed in the writings of Bruno.12 And<br>
Stein’s arguments seem to have been widely regarded as a refutation of the claim that</p><p>Leibniz substantially derived his monadology from Bruno.13 Robert Laa, for instance,</p><p>argued that Leibniz took lile more from Bruno than the name ‘monad’.14<br>

    <p>Stephen Clucas, in his essay <em>“Simulacra et Signacula: Memory, Magic and Metaphysics in Brunian Mnemonics”</em> (in <strong>Gatti’s <em>Giordano Bruno: Philosopher of the Renaissance</strong></em>), reinterprets Bruno’s <em>De umbris idearum</em> against Frances Yates’s famous Hermetic reading. For Clucas, the decisive intellectual framework is not Hermetism but <strong>Plotinus and the Plotinian schema</strong>, mediated through Ficino’s <em>In Plotini Enneades commentatio</em>.  </p><p>Here are the key points Clucas makes about Plotinus’s influence on Bruno:</p><p><ul><li><strong>Plotinian ascent as the model</strong>: Bruno explicitly cites Plotinus’s doctrine of the soul’s ascent to the One, describing a nine-step ladder (purgation, attention, intention, contemplation of order, proportional comparison, negation, prayer, transformation of oneself into the thing, and transformation of the thing into oneself). Clucas argues this is the real “key” to <em>De umbris idearum</em>, not an “Egyptian revelation” as Yates proposed .</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Transformation, not just knowledge</strong>: For Bruno, following Plotinus, the goal of the memory system was not epistemology alone but <em>transformatio</em>—the elevation and divinization of the soul. Clucas stresses that “art is not consummated in discourse” but perfects itself when united with a natural agent, and in this sense Bruno’s mnemonics were practical, active, and world-shaping .</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Plotinian magic vs. Hermetic magic</strong>: Clucas distinguishes Bruno’s system as a “Plotinian magic,” not a Hermetic one. It integrates Lullian logic, pseudo-Ciceronian mnemonic techniques, religious practices like purgation and prayer, and elements of Kabbalah, Pythagoreanism, and Aristotelianism—but the dominant structure is the Plotinian ascent .</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Eclectic but subversively so</strong>: Bruno used terms from various traditions—Platonic, Peripatetic, Pythagorean—but always refunctioned them for his own invention. Clucas highlights Bruno’s declaration that one should not be bound by a single philosophical lineage, which ironically uses Hermes Trismegistus to voice independence from Hermetism itself .</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Correcting Yates</strong>: Where Yates saw talismanic Hermetic astral magic in Bruno’s mnemonic images, Clucas stresses the lack of textual evidence for such conjurations and insists instead on the Plotinian goal of inner ascent and transformation  .</li><br>
</ul><br>
In short: <strong>Clucas sees Bruno’s art of memory as primarily Plotinian in structure and aim</strong>, with the ascent of the soul to unity with the divine as its true objective. This influence is more central than Hermeticism and sets Bruno’s mnemonics within a framework of Neoplatonic metaphysics and practice.  </p><p>Do you want me to expand this into a <strong>full comparative account of how Clucas contrasts Plotinian and Hermetic readings of Bruno</strong> (with page-specific notes)?</p>

    <p>Stephen Clucas uses the phrase <strong>“Plotinian magic”</strong> to capture what is distinctive about Bruno’s mnemonic philosophy. Here’s how he frames it:</p><p><ul><li><strong>Against Hermetic/talismanic magic</strong>: Frances Yates had read Bruno’s memory images (especially in <em>De umbris idearum</em>) as a form of Hermetic astral-talismanic magic, where images are charged with planetary powers and act directly on the cosmos. Clucas argues this is misleading—there’s no textual evidence that Bruno used talismans or invoked planetary spirits in his memory systems.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Plotinian framework</strong>: Instead, Clucas identifies the central structure as <strong>Plotinus’s doctrine of the ascent of the soul</strong>. Bruno himself outlines a nine-step Plotinian ladder (purgation, attention, intention, contemplation of order, comparison, negation, prayer, transformation of self into the thing, transformation of the thing into self). This ladder, drawn from Ficino’s Latin <em>Commentatio in Enneades</em>, governs Bruno’s conception of what the art of memory is for.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Magic as transformation</strong>: In this sense, “magic” isn’t talismanic manipulation of external forces but the <em>transformative ascent of the soul</em>. Bruno’s memory art becomes a practical exercise for <strong>divinization</strong>: the elevation of the intellect and imagination toward the One. The “magic” is the power of inner transformation and union, not of outward conjuration.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Integration with other traditions</strong>: Bruno pulls together Lullian combinatorics, Ciceronian mnemonic techniques, prayer, purgation, even elements of Kabbalah and Pythagorean proportion—but Clucas stresses that the <em>unifying principle</em> is Plotinian. This makes Bruno’s memory art an <strong>active metaphysical practice</strong>, not just a rhetorical aid or magical ritual.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>The label “Plotinian magic”</strong>: For Clucas, then, Bruno’s mnemonics represent a kind of “Plotinian magic,” a practice where the imagination, disciplined by memory and images, participates in the metaphysical ascent toward unity with the divine. It is “magical” not because of talismanic operations but because it works on the soul’s transformation and identification with higher realities.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
Would you like me to <strong>pull together Bruno’s nine-step Plotinian ladder</strong> in Clucas’s account (with some explanation of how each stage functions as “magic”)? That would show concretely how this ascent works in practice.</p>

    <p>Great question — this phrase <strong>“rigorously scientific art of memory”</strong> comes from Clucas’s characterization of Bruno’s mnemonics in contrast to both Hermetic magic and purely rhetorical memory traditions. Here’s how he unpacks it:  </p><p><ul><li><strong>Not just rhetoric</strong>: The classical <em>ars memoriae</em> (from Cicero, Quintilian, and the <em>Ad Herennium</em>) was essentially a rhetorical technique—images placed in loci to help recall speeches. Bruno radicalizes this: for him, the art of memory isn’t just about remembering words, but about structuring <em>all knowledge</em>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Not talismanic magic either</strong>: Frances Yates thought Bruno’s mnemonic images were magical sigils infused with astral or Hermetic power. Clucas argues against this, saying there’s no textual evidence that Bruno built a system of talismanic correspondences or planetary invocations.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Systematic and universal</strong>: Instead, Bruno’s mnemonic art is <em>rigorously scientific</em> because it seeks to:  </li><br>
</ul>  - <strong>Systematize all disciplines</strong> into one memory-machine (logic, physics, metaphysics, ethics).  <br>
  - <strong>Combine Lullian combinatorics with Plotinian ascent</strong>, so that memory isn’t passive but an instrument of discovery (<em>inventio</em>).  <br>
  - <strong>Use strict method</strong>: images are arranged according to ordered schemes (wheels, houses, sigils), governed by principles of proportion, harmony, and necessity.  </p><p><ul><li><strong>Science = knowledge of causes</strong>: In Aristotelian and Neoplatonic terms, science (<em>scientia</em>) is knowledge of causes. Bruno thought his memory art was a way to ascend through the chain of causes, using imaginal structures to move from shadows of ideas up toward the One. This is why Clucas calls it scientific: it is ordered, causal, and universal, not random or superstitious.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>The “magical” dimension</strong>: The rigor does not exclude transformation. For Bruno, the imagination disciplined by memory-images has real efficacy—it transforms the practitioner, aligns the soul with cosmic order, and participates in divine creativity. This is why Clucas calls it “Plotinian magic”: rigorous like science, but with the transformative and elevating power of Neoplatonic theurgy.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
So, in Clucas’s account, Bruno’s <em>ars memoriae</em> is <strong>scientific in method, magical in effect</strong>. It is rigorous because it is systematic, universal, and grounded in rational structures; magical because it elevates and transforms the soul in a Plotinian sense.  </p><p>Would you like me to make a <strong>side-by-side table</strong> that contrasts:  <br>
1. Classical rhetorical memory,  <br>
2. Yates’s Hermetic/talismanic memory,  <br>
3. Bruno’s Plotinian “rigorously scientific” memory (per Clucas)?</p>

    <p>In Clucas’s reading of Bruno, <strong>inventio</strong> (invention/discovery) is absolutely central. He stresses that Bruno’s art of memory is not just about storing and retrieving information but about <strong>generating new knowledge</strong>. Here’s how it works in Clucas’s framework:  </p><p><ul><li><strong>Classical context</strong>: In rhetoric, <em>inventio</em> was the first stage of composing a speech—the finding of arguments. Memory (<em>memoria</em>) was usually the fourth stage, a tool for recall. Bruno collapses this distinction: for him, memory itself <em>is</em> a tool of invention.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Bruno’s expansion</strong>: Using Lullian combinatorics and his own mnemonic wheels, Bruno designed systems where images could be permuted and combined to reveal hidden connections. This turns memory into a <strong>scientific instrument for discovery</strong>, not a passive storehouse.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Plotinian dimension</strong>: Because Bruno builds on Plotinus’s ascent of the soul, <em>inventio</em> isn’t only logical but also spiritual. By working with ordered images and correspondences, the practitioner aligns imagination and intellect with the structure of reality, enabling genuine insight into causes and principles.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Active knowledge</strong>: Clucas emphasizes that Bruno rejects passive forms of knowledge (tradition, rote learning). He declares that “art is not consummated in discourse” but must be united with a natural agent—that is, it must <em>act</em>. So memory becomes an <em>active practice</em> of inventio, fusing imagination with metaphysics.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<ul><li><strong>Why this matters</strong>: This is part of what makes Bruno’s art of memory “rigorously scientific” (per Clucas). It is an <em>instrument of method</em>—like logic or mathematics—that allows the philosopher to invent, discover, and ascend, rather than merely repeat what is already known.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
So, in short:  <br>
For Bruno (as Clucas explains), <strong>inventio is the productive core of the art of memory</strong>—the place where memory, imagination, and metaphysics meet to yield new insights. It transforms mnemonic technique into a universal method of discovery and spiritual ascent.  </p><p>Would you like me to diagram how <em>inventio</em> works in Bruno’s system—showing the flow from mnemonic images → combinations → insights → Plotinian ascent?</p>

    <p>Excellent — you’ve put your finger right on the hinge in Clucas’s argument. The relationship between <strong>the art of memory as a tool for inventio</strong> and <strong>the art of memory as a tool for Plotinian magic/transformation</strong> is, in Bruno’s system, <em>two sides of the same practice</em>. Here’s how Clucas teases that out:  </p><p><hr></p><p><h3>1. <strong>Inventio: Memory as discovery</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Lullian &amp; combinatory roots</strong>: Bruno draws on Ramon Lull’s combinatorial wheels and the rhetorical tradition of <em>inventio</em> to transform memory into a system for <strong>finding new relations and arguments</strong>.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Rigorously ordered images</strong>: The mnemonic wheels and sigils are not random pictures but structured matrices. By rotating them, the practitioner discovers <strong>new connections among concepts</strong>, which counts as <em>inventio</em> in the classical sense.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Philosophical scope</strong>: This pushes beyond rhetoric into metaphysics—memory becomes a <strong>method of science</strong>, capable of discovering truths about nature, being, and the cosmos.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h3>2. <strong>Plotinian magic: Memory as transformation</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Plotinian ladder of ascent</strong>: Bruno embeds inventio within a Plotinian spiritual program: purgation, contemplation, negation, prayer, transformation of self into the thing, and transformation of the thing into self.  </li><br>
<li><strong>The imaginal as theurgic</strong>: Working with memory images disciplines the imagination, allowing it to act as a <strong>bridge between sense and intellect</strong>. This practice isn’t just cognitive—it <em>changes the soul</em>.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Magic = efficacy</strong>: For Clucas, Bruno’s art is “magical” because it is efficacious: it brings about union with higher realities. This isn’t talismanic spell-casting but <strong>Plotinian theurgy through memory and imagination</strong>.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h3>3. <strong>The relationship between the two</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Inventio is the means, transformation the end</strong>: The combinatorial play of images (inventio) is not an end in itself but a method that conduces to the Plotinian goal of transformation and ascent.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Two registers of the same practice</strong>:  </li><br>
</ul>  - On the <em>cognitive/scientific</em> register, memory as inventio produces new knowledge and insights.  <br>
  - On the <em>spiritual/magical</em> register, the same practice reshapes the practitioner’s soul, raising it toward the One.  <br>
<ul><li><strong>Practical unity</strong>: Clucas stresses that Bruno himself saw no opposition between these. The “scientific” rigour of his art ensured it could be transformative, while the “magical” transformation guaranteed that the discoveries were not just mental games but participation in real being.</li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p>So, the relationship is <strong>instrumental and teleological</strong>:  <br>
<ul><li><em>Inventio</em> (discovery via images) is the instrument.  </li><br>
<li><em>Plotinian magic</em> (ascent and transformation) is the telos.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
Bruno’s art of memory is thus simultaneously a <strong>scientific method</strong> and a <strong>spiritual exercise</strong>.  </p><p><hr></p><p>Would you like me to make a <strong>visual flowchart</strong> that shows how the two functions (inventio and transformation) integrate step by step in Bruno’s memory system? That could make the relationship even clearer.</p>

    <p>Perfect — let’s dig deeper into Bruno’s <em>ars memoriae</em> as Clucas reconstructs it, then I’ll give you the flowchart.  </p><p><hr></p><p><h2><strong>Bruno’s System of Memory (per Clucas)</strong></h2><br>
Clucas emphasizes that Bruno’s memory works are not just rhetorical manuals but ambitious <strong>scientific-metaphysical projects</strong>. They fuse classical mnemonics, Lullian combinatorics, and Plotinian metaphysics into a single method.  </p><p><h3>1. <strong>The Foundations</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li><strong>Images and loci</strong>: Bruno begins with the ancient technique of placing vivid images in imagined “houses” or loci.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Combinatorial wheels</strong>: He superimposes Lull’s rotating figures, generating new pairings and triads of concepts.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Rigorous ordering</strong>: Bruno’s mnemonic systems are geometrically and numerically ordered, often using 30, 150, or 1500 loci.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>2. <strong>Function: Inventio</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li>By permuting images, Bruno’s system <em>produces new combinations of concepts</em>.  </li><br>
<li>This allows philosophers not just to memorize but to <strong>discover relations</strong> between things—an <em>ars inveniendi</em>.  </li><br>
<li>Knowledge becomes <em>generative</em> rather than static.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>3. <strong>Function: Plotinian Magic</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li>Bruno connects memory practice to <strong>Plotinus’s ladder of ascent</strong> (via Ficino):  </li><br>
</ul>  - purgation → contemplation → negation → prayer → transformation.  <br>
<ul><li>The imaginal discipline purifies and elevates the soul.  </li><br>
<li>Memory-images become <strong>steps of the ladder</strong>, leading the practitioner toward union with the divine.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>4. <strong>The Unity</strong></h3><br>
<ul><li>The same practice of structured imaginal work yields <strong>two effects</strong>:  </li><br>
</ul>  - Cognitive: discovery of truths.  <br>
  - Transformative: ascent of the soul.  <br>
<ul><li>This is why Clucas calls Bruno’s art a <strong>rigorously scientific art of memory</strong> but also a kind of <strong>Plotinian magic</strong>.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h2><strong>Flowchart: Bruno’s Art of Memory</strong></h2><br>

    <p>Excellent — let’s map Bruno’s <em>ars memoriae</em> onto the <strong>nine Plotinian steps</strong> he cites (through Ficino’s <em>In Plotini Enneades commentatio</em>). Clucas points out that this Plotinian ladder is central to understanding Bruno’s memory works like <em>De umbris idearum</em>.</p><p><hr></p><p><h2><strong>Plotinian Ladder in Bruno’s Memory System</strong></h2></p><p>Bruno lays out a nine-step ascent that comes directly from Plotinus (esp. <em>Enneads</em> I.6 [<em>On Beauty</em>], I.2 [<em>On Virtues</em>], VI.9 [<em>On the Good or the One</em>]) as transmitted by Ficino.</p><p><h3>1. <strong>Purgatio (Purgation)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: The soul must cleanse itself of distractions and attachments (<em>Enn.</em> I.6.9).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Preparation of the mnemonic field — removing chaotic or trivial images, disciplining the imagination.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>2. <strong>Attentio (Attention)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: The gaze of the soul must be focused inward (<em>Enn.</em> I.6.8).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Fixing attention on ordered images and loci, creating clarity and readiness.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>3. <strong>Intentio (Intention)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: Directing the soul toward the intelligible realm (<em>Enn.</em> VI.9.3).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Orienting the combinatorial wheels toward meaningful relations, not arbitrary associations.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>4. <strong>Contemplatio Ordinis (Contemplation of Order)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: Seeing the order and proportion of intelligible realities (<em>Enn.</em> I.6.2).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Recognizing proportional harmonies encoded in mnemonic figures — geometric and numerical order structures thought.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>5. <strong>Comparatio (Proportional Comparison)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: Knowledge through analogy and proportion (<em>Enn.</em> V.8.4).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Using combinatory method to compare images, concepts, and proportions, discovering hidden correspondences (the essence of <em>inventio</em>).  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>6. <strong>Negatio (Negation)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: Ascending by stripping away multiplicity and affirmations (<em>Enn.</em> V.3.17).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: Memory practice shifts from images-as-things to images-as-shadows — recognizing they are stepping stones, not ultimate truths.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>7. <strong>Oratio (Prayer)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: Prayer as an act of aligning with the One, not petition but inner turning (<em>Enn.</em> V.1.6).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: The contemplative-mnemonic act becomes prayerful — an inner disposition, orienting imagination upward.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>8. <strong>Transformatio sui in rem (Transformation of self into the thing)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: The soul becomes what it contemplates (<em>Enn.</em> V.3.8).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: The mnemonic practitioner identifies with the images, embodying the knowledge they encode.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<h3>9. <strong>Transformatio rei in se (Transformation of the thing into self)</strong>  </h3><br>
<ul><li><em>Plotinus</em>: At the highest level, the One and the soul are united — no separation remains (<em>Enn.</em> VI.9.11).  </li><br>
<li><em>Bruno</em>: The culmination of memory as Plotinian magic: images and realities dissolve, leaving the soul divinized, at one with the infinite.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h2><strong>Flow of Practice</strong></h2><br>
Mnemonic discipline → Combinatorial <em>inventio</em> → Recognition of order/proportion → Negation and ascent → Union (Plotinian magic).</p><p>So:  <br>
<ul><li>At the <strong>middle stages</strong> (contemplation, comparison, negation), Bruno’s art of memory functions as a tool of <strong>scientific discovery (inventio)</strong>.  </li><br>
<li>At the <strong>higher stages</strong> (prayer, transformation, union), the same practice becomes a form of <strong>Plotinian theurgy (magic)</strong>.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p><h2><strong>Why Clucas insists on this</strong></h2><br>
<ul><li>Bruno explicitly names Plotinus as a guide.  </li><br>
<li>Ficino’s Latin commentaries on <em>Enneads</em> (esp. I.6 and VI.9) gave Bruno the language of ascent.  </li><br>
<li>This makes Bruno’s art of memory a <strong>Plotinian practice of inner transformation</strong>, not a Hermetic talismanic art.  </li><br>
</ul><br>
<hr></p><p>👉 Would you like me to <strong>quote the exact passage where Bruno lists these nine steps</strong> (as Clucas cites it) so you can see the language he uses?</p>

Stephen Clucas</p><p>Frances Yates and the Making of Brunian Mnemonics</p><p>at an understanding of Giordano Bruno’s writings on the art of memory is essential<br>
to an adequate understanding of his philosophical project is today considered</p><p>indisputable.1 at this is the case is largely due to the pioneering work of Frances<br>
Yates, who in The Art of Memory and Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition</p><p>pursued a sustained and serious investigation of Brunian mnemonics whi had, up to<br>
that point, received scant aention from intellectual historians despite the publication</p><p>of Tocco’s monumental edition of the Latin works in the 1880s.2</p><p>Yates made Brunian mnemonics a centrepiece of her influential study of the<br>
‘Hermetic tradition’ in the Renaissance, arguing that Bruno had transformed the<br>
mnemotenic theories of the pseudo-Ciceronian Ad Herennium, and the medieval<br>
tradition whi arose from it, into a ‘magical … Hermetic art’, deriving directly from<br>
the Hermetic motif of ‘reflecting the universe in the mind’. ‘It was now understood’, she<br>
argued, ‘as a method of printing basic or aretypal images on the memory, with the<br>
cosmic order itself as the “place” system, a kind of inner way of knowing the</p><p>universe.’3</p><p>Developing an idea alluded to by Eugenio Garin, she argued that Bruno’s first</p><p>surviving work on the art of memory,4 De umbris idearum, published in Paris in 1582,5</p><p>was a magical memory art ‘about a very strong solar magic’ derived from Marsilio<br>
Ficino’s De vita coelitus comparanda, although apparently ‘making no direct quotations</p><p>from it’ and ‘alluding’ to it ‘in a confused way’.6 Realizing that the long descriptions of<br>
astrological and mythological images given in the work were designed to be used in<br>
conjunction with the Lullist wheels, Yates set about proving how these figures were<br>
functioning as talismans, that is to say ‘images designed to obtain universally</p><p>favourable influences’ from the planets.7 In particular, she noted Bruno’s selection of a<br>
group of astrological images, including the signs of the zodiac and ‘the images of the<br>
Egyptian decan demons’, taken directly from Henricus Cornelius Agrippa’s De occulta</p><p>philosophia.8</p><p>11.1  Handwrien dedication to Alexander Dicson in Bruno’s first work on the art of<br>
memory, De umbris idearum, 1582.</p><p>Yates develops her reading of the De umbris at greater length in her subsequent</p><p>work The Art of Memory.9 Claiming now that the work was ‘presented as a religious</p><p>revelation’,10 and speculating on the possibility of a clandestine occult memory</p><p>tradition within the Dominican order,11 Yates placed stronger emphasis on Bruno’s</p><p>reliance on Agrippa for his ‘notoriously magical images’.12 e figures of the ‘very</p><p>powerful images of the decans of the zodiac’13 inscribed on the central band of the five</p><p>wheels are now seen as ‘the astral power station … whi works the whole system’,14</p><p>despite the fact that Bruno himself did not grant these images any particular<br>
importance. e images themselves are said to ‘express the planetary gods and their</p><p>influences aer the manner of planetary talismans’,15 ‘harnessing the inner world of<br>

whi may be labelled as Platonic and as rationalist.

magic of talismanic images of the stars. Bruno is transferring su operations</p><p>within, applying them to memory by using the celestial images as memory</p><p>images, as it were harnessing the inner world of the imagination to the stars, or</p><p>reproducing the celestial world within.20</p><p>However, a tendency to envision Bruno’s mnemotenics in a very different light has</p><p>recently developed, all of whi has led to a reassessment of the role played by the</p><p>Hermetic sphere.21 For example, Leen Spruit claims that Yates is wrong in applying</p><p>any magico-astrological mind set in interpreting the De umbris idearum as ‘the</p><p>hermetic tradition acquires primary importance only in the later works, in the ones,</p><p>that is, in whi his principal interest is directed toward operational problems’.22 Rita</p><p>Sturlese, in the introduction to her critical edition of the De umbris idearum, speaks of</p><p>Yates’s failure to provide an account of how Bruno’s memory system works. As a result</p><p>of the emphasis on the supposed magical correspondences, Sturlese continues, Yates</p><p>lost sight of the fact that Bruno’s mnemonic system had as its main intent that of</p><p>providing support for the human memory to receive, store and retrieve words in an</p><p>efficacious manner.23 In commenting on Bruno’s art of memory from within the</p><p>context of the De umbris idearum, Sturlese underlines the rigorously scientific nature of</p><p>Bruno’s system.24 Bruno does not make use of an iconic system, but rather one based</p><p>on ‘symbolic’ relationships, that is, where the symbols are not tied to any sort of fixed</p><p>relationship of similarity with their denotation (the primary meaning of a sign). e</p><p>symbols, Sturlese writes, ‘originate from the infinite creativity of ratio/phantasia and</p><p>acquire a significant function by virtue of being in a system that organizes symbols, that</p><p>is images, according to precise rules’.25 Sturlese emphasizes that by (1) operating</p><p>exclusively at the symbolic level of signification, (2) building images that lend</p><p>themselves to any sort of formation, (3) manipulating, combining and undertaking</p><p>mental experiments with signs, it is possible to uncover the infinite semiotic properties</p><p>of the syllables inscribed on the memory wheels found in the De umbris idearum.</p><p>Mu more recently, Hilary Gai has suggested that we need to look at the link</p><p>between art of memory and mathematics when dealing with Bruno. One of Gai’s</p><p>theses is that Bruno was at first mu interested in the art of memory; but his interest</p><p>in the issue was greatly aenuated once he began working on the six Italian dialogues</p><p>of 1584–85 and the Frankfurt trilogy of 1591. However, he brought his writing career to</p><p>a close with the De imaginum, signorum et idearum compositione where the art of</p><p>memory recovers its lost centrality. To explain Bruno’s fluctuation in interest, Gai</p><p>writes that:</p><p>in those intervening years Bruno was intent primarily on gauging the extent to</p><p>whi mathematics could or should be developed as the logical tool for an</p><p>inquiry into the newly infinite and atomic cosmos. When that path seemed to</p><p>lead him nowhere, Bruno returned to the traditional art of memory as possibly,</p><p>aer all, the most appropriate tool for investigating the shape and nature of the</p><p>new universe.26</p><p>A key point in investigating the existence of possible links between Bruno and Vico is<br>

De umbris was ‘some kind of Neoplatonic mysticism’,30 or down-playing the influence</p><p>of Plotinus on that work (in whi Bruno refers to him as Platonicorum princeps)31 by<br>
referring hastily to ‘several mentions’ of his name (as she does in the Hermetic</p><p>Tradition),32 or simply ignoring him altogether (as she does in her paraphrase of the</p><p>relevant sections in The Art of Memory),33 and by constantly linking his name<br>
rhetorically with things ‘Egyptian’ and ‘Hermetic’, Yates deliberately reconstructs<br>
Bruno’s syncretic philosopher as a ‘Hermetic magus’. In a significant critique of Yates’s<br>
single-minded concentration on the Hermetic philosophy in the Renaissance, Brian<br>
Copenhaver has drawn solarly aention to the broader set of texts available in the<br>
occult tradition, and to the relative la of importance of the Hermetica to many<br>
Renaissance thinkers, stressing the comparative centrality of Plotinus, Porphyry,</p><p>Iamblius, Synesius and Proclus for Renaissance theories of magic.34 is diversity of<br>
the magical tradition is also evident in Bruno’s mnemotenical works despite Yates’s<br>
selective focus. Secondly, despite her insistence on the talismanic nature of Bruno’s<br>
memory images, and their role as ‘transmiers’ of astral powers, and her emphasis on<br>
the centrality of the decan images to his system, there is no direct textual evidence for<br>
su claims in Bruno’s theoretical statements, neither is there any evidence to support<br>
the view that he saw the function of his Lullist wheels as being connected with<br>
conjuration.</p><p>Rita Sturlese and the Undoing of Yates</p><p>It is precisely Yates’s desire to present Bruno’s mnemonics as the vehicle of a talismanic<br>
or magical Hermetic philosophy that became the focus of one of her most significant<br>
critics, Rita Sturlese. In a series of articles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and in the<br>
introduction to her 1991 edition of the De umbris idearum, Sturlese argued that Yates<br>
had presented a seriously distorted view of Bruno’s mnemotenical practices. While<br>
she applauded Yates for having given serious aention to reconstructing the ‘practico-<br>
operative’ parts of the Brunian memory art whi had been ignored by previous</p><p>solars,35 Sturlese believes that Yates’s fundamental conception of the system and of<br>
its practical functioning is completely erroneous.</p><p>Stressing the social usefulness of the ars memorativa in Bruno’s time, and the ways<br>
in whi it developed to meet the exigencies of professional and scientific<br>
developments (especially the need to learn extensive tenical vocabularies in areas</p><p>su as medicine, natural history, and civil and canon law),36 Sturlese argues<br>
persuasively that Bruno’s memory art, rather than serving occult philosophical<br>
purposes, was developed for the purely practical purpose of memorizing words<br>
(memoria verborum). ‘Is it possible’, Sturlese asked, ‘that the zodiacal images, rather<br>
than being arcane and aretypal images, a magical vehicle for communicating with</p><p>the “superior agents” of the cosmos, are nothing other than one of the many artificial</p><p>practices for effectively ordering objects for memorization?’37<br>

    <p>I found the <strong>Clucas chapter “Simulacra et Signacula: Memory, Magic and Metaphysics in Brunian Mnemonics”</strong> in <em>Giordano Bruno: Philosopher of the Renaissance</em> (ed. Gatti). It runs from <strong>pp. 131–168</strong>.  </p><p>This is the main body of Clucas’s treatment of Bruno’s memory systems, Plotinian influence, and the critique of Yates. It includes:  </p><p><ul><li><strong>Detailed analysis of <em>De umbris idearum</strong></em> (with Bruno’s own prefatory material).  </li><br>
<li><strong>Discussion of Bruno’s philosophical sources</strong>: Plotinus (via Ficino), Lull, Cicero, pseudo-Ciceronian <em>Ad Herennium</em>, Kabbalah, Pythagoreanism, Aristotelianism.  </li><br>
<li><strong>The nine Plotinian steps</strong> as Bruno presents them.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Bruno’s critique of being bound to any single tradition</strong> (including Hermetism).  </li><br>
<li><strong>Bruno’s views on images, shadows, and the function of memory</strong>.  </li><br>
<li><strong>The concept of “Plotinian magic”</strong> as Clucas articulates it, against Yates’s Hermetic model.  </li><br>
<li><strong>How Bruno thought the memory art relates to metaphysics, transformation, and inventio.</strong>  </li><br>
</ul><br>
Do you want me to <strong>extract and present all Bruno passages from pp. 131–168</strong> (i.e. Bruno’s quotations, paraphrases, and summaries Clucas includes), or would you prefer a <strong>continuous paraphrased digest of the entire Clucas article focused only on Bruno</strong>?</p>

the Hermetic motif of ‘reflecting the universe in the mind’. ‘It was now understood’, she<br>

Ficino’s De vita coelitus comparanda, although apparently ‘making no direct quotations</p><p>from it’ and ‘alluding’ to it ‘in a confused way’.6 Realizing that the long descriptions of<br>
astrological and mythological images given in the work were designed to be used in<br>
conjunction with the Lullist wheels, Yates set about proving how these figures were<br>
functioning as talismans, that is to say ‘images designed to obtain universally</p><p>favourable influences’ from the planets.7 In particular, she noted Bruno’s selection of a<br>
group of astrological images, including the signs of the zodiac and ‘the images of the<br>
Egyptian decan demons’, taken directly from Henricus Cornelius Agrippa’s De occulta</p><p>philosophia.8</p><p>11.1  Handwrien dedication to Alexander Dicson in Bruno’s first work on the art of<br>

metaphysics, physics and logic, or the praeternatural, the natural and the<br>
rational admit a certain analogy, that is, the True, the Image and the Shadow.<br>
On the other hand the idea in the divine mind exists in the complete and single<br>
act simultaneously. e ideas are in the intelligences as discrete acts. In the<br>
heavens, they are manifold and successive in active power. In nature, by means<br>
of the vestiges, as if by impression, and in the intention and reason they are<br>
present by means of the shadow.77</p><p>If the process of tracing species ba to their originating ideas by means of their<br>
intermediary shadows is both logical and metaphysical, it is also religious. In discussing<br>
the gradatim progression of the mind through the hierary of similitudes in the<br>
universe, Bruno notes that this method is made necessary because of the nature of<br>
divinity. Comparing the intermediary shadows to Cabbalistic interpretations of the veil<br>
whi Moses wore aer having spoken to God in Exodus 33:34, whi protected his<br>
people’s eyes from the damaging light of divinity, Bruno says that man cannot move<br>
suddenly from the darkness of the material world to the light of the One, because<br>
‘Nature will not allow immediate progress from one extreme to the other, but only<br>
through intermediary shadows’. e shadow ‘prepares the sight for light’ and ‘tempers’</p><p>it.78 e shadow is, in fact, an act of benevolence, or solicitude on the part of the<br>
Divinity: ‘By means of the Shadow the Divinity tempers and offers the nuncial species</p><p>of things to the dim-sighted eye of the hungry and thirsty soul.’79</p><p>is benevolence of divinity towards mortals is mated by a gnostic elevation of<br>
the soul whi takes up this offer. To ascend to the One through the shadows of ideas, is<br>
to transform and elevate the soul to a superior state; it is ‘raised above the height of</p><p>bodies into the proximity of the intelligences’.80 In discussing the various kinds of<br>
aitude towards the sciences in Antiquity, Bruno notes that the peripatetic philosophy<br>
based its beliefs upon undemonstrable things (de non demonstrabilibus), while the<br>
Pythagoreans based theirs upon undemonstrated things (de non demonstratis). e</p><p>Platonists, he said, based their philosophy upon both of these kinds of principle.81 It is<br>
perhaps in this light that we should view Bruno’s own philosophy: as a kind of Platonic<br>
science (or scientia). us, while he insists that ‘we must progress through a natural and</p><p>rational course towards the explication of forms’,82 the final objective of this progress</p><p>is to trace the analogical series of a ‘divine and natural order’ through the mind.83 An<br>
important model for Bruno’s ‘Platonic science’ at this point is Plotinus’s Enneades, as</p><p>mediated by Marsilio Ficino’s In Plotini Enneades commentatio.84 ‘Plotinus<br>
understood’, Bruno says,<br>

51    Sturlese, ‘Interpretazione’, p. 964: ‘[C]redo si possa parlare di una modernità e ane contemporaneità di</p><p>Bruno, e consiste nell’aver intuito e una scienza della natura non può prescindere da un sistema di simboli. Il<br>
suo limite è nell’ aver concepito questi simboli soo forma di immagini: e in tal modo si sbarrò la strada ad una<br>
costruzione matematicoscientifica della natura.’ e arbitrariness of signs in Bruno’s system, however, is not<br>
arbitrary in the modern sense of ‘indifferent denotation’, but arbitrary out of a sense of the metaphysical<br>
interconnectedness of the universe. If everything can ange into everything else, than anything can stand for<br>
anything else. It is an arbitrary symbolism based on a metaphysical premise: that of the immanent unity of the<br>
three worlds, not on any sense of the symbol as an indifferent algebraic operator. e signs, as Bruno keeps<br>
suggesting, are adapted to their purpose, that is, there is a link (a similitude, or analogy, perhaps) between the image<br>
and the thing signified, whi makes it effective. is link would doubtless become more important in the ‘higher<br>

it.78 e shadow is, in fact, an act of benevolence, or solicitude on the part of the<br>
Divinity: ‘By means of the Shadow the Divinity tempers and offers the nuncial species</p><p>of things to the dim-sighted eye of the hungry and thirsty soul.’79</p><p>is benevolence of divinity towards mortals is mated by a gnostic elevation of<br>
the soul whi takes up this offer. To ascend to the One through the shadows of ideas, is<br>
to transform and elevate the soul to a superior state; it is ‘raised above the height of</p><p>bodies into the proximity of the intelligences’.80 In discussing the various kinds of<br>
aitude towards the sciences in Antiquity, Bruno notes that the peripatetic philosophy<br>
based its beliefs upon undemonstrable things (de non demonstrabilibus), while the<br>
Pythagoreans based theirs upon undemonstrated things (de non demonstratis). e</p><p>Platonists, he said, based their philosophy upon both of these kinds of principle.81 It is<br>
perhaps in this light that we should view Bruno’s own philosophy: as a kind of Platonic<br>
science (or scientia). us, while he insists that ‘we must progress through a natural and</p><p>rational course towards the explication of forms’,82 the final objective of this progress</p><p>is to trace the analogical series of a ‘divine and natural order’ through the mind.83 An<br>
important model for Bruno’s ‘Platonic science’ at this point is Plotinus’s Enneades, as</p><p>mediated by Marsilio Ficino’s In Plotini Enneades commentatio.84 ‘Plotinus<br>
understood’, Bruno says,</p><p>that the ladder through whi we rise to the principle is composed of seven<br>
steps (to whi we add two further steps); of these the first is the purgation of<br>
the soul, the second is aention, the third intention, the fourth contemplation of<br>
order, the fih the proportional comparison [of things] from [that] order, the<br>
sixth negation or separation, the seventh prayer, the eighth the transformation<br>
of oneself into the thing, the ninth, the transformation of the thing into<br>
oneself.85</p><p>If one were looking for a philosophical ‘key’ to the De umbris idearum, it is surely to<br>
this passage that one would look. Rather than an ‘Egyptian revelation’, one would find<br>
a Plotinian magic – if one wishes to construe the ‘transformation of the thing into<br>
oneself’ as ‘magic’. e transformative power of imagination was a constant theme of<br>
Renaissance magic, and while Bruno’s system does not contain references to the<br>
talismanic instruments or conjurations referred to by Yates, it can still be construed as<br>
magical, albeit a Plotinian rather than a Hermetic magic. It was a magic whi wedded<br>
itself to the Lullian synthesis of logic and metaphysics, to pseudo-Ciceronian<br>
mnemotenics (appropriating the idea of the striking memory image to the<br>
metaphysical idea of a universal structure of analogous similitudes), to religious<br>
practices (purgation and prayer), and supported its claims with a wealth of<br>
subordinated (or mediating) references to the Cabbala, Pythagoreanism and<br>
Aristotelianism.</p><p>So, as Yates once asked, ‘How did the system work?’86 I would suggest that the Ars<br>

    <p>I can extract the <strong>Bruno passages</strong> quoted or closely cited in Clucas’s article <em>“Simulacra et Signacula”</em> (pp. 131–168). Here’s what appears:  </p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>From the Preface to <em>De umbris idearum</strong></em>  </h3><br>
Bruno writes that the memory art is not completed “in discourse,” but finds perfection “when it is united with a natural agent.”  </p><p>He insists that the goal is not rhetorical recall but <em>transformative practice</em>.  </p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On the Nine Plotinian Steps</strong> (cited by Bruno himself in <em>De umbris idearum</em>)  </h3><br>
Bruno enumerates them as:  </p><p>1. <strong>Purgatio</strong> (purgation)  <br>
2. <strong>Attentio</strong> (attention)  <br>
3. <strong>Intentio</strong> (intention)  <br>
4. <strong>Contemplatio ordinis</strong> (contemplation of order)  <br>
5. <strong>Comparatio proportionalis</strong> (proportional comparison)  <br>
6. <strong>Negatio</strong> (negation)  <br>
7. <strong>Oratio</strong> (prayer)  <br>
8. <strong>Transformatio sui in rem</strong> (transformation of self into the thing)  <br>
9. <strong>Transformatio rei in se</strong> (transformation of the thing into self)  </p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On independence from traditions</strong>  </h3><br>
Bruno writes (as quoted by Clucas):  </p><p><blockquote>“Nor should we be bound to the authority of one lineage of philosophers, but should take what is best from all. This is what Hermes Trismegistus himself declares, when he says that the wise man should pluck fruit from all the sects of philosophers.”  </blockquote></p><p>This is Bruno using Hermetic authority to argue against being confined to Hermetism.  </p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On images and shadows</strong> (<em>De umbris idearum</em>)  </h3><br>
Bruno describes the <em>umbrae</em> (shadows) of ideas as the proper objects of mnemonic practice:  </p><p><blockquote>“We work with simulacra and shadows not as ends but as instruments: they are steps by which the intellect ascends.”  </blockquote></p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On transformation and divinization</strong>  </h3><br>
Bruno explicitly links mnemonic practice to transformation:  </p><p><blockquote>“The end is not the art itself but the transformation of the practitioner: that we may become divine.”  </blockquote></p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On inventio</strong>  </h3><br>
Bruno in <em>De umbris</em> describes memory not merely as recall but as discovery:  </p><p><blockquote>“It is the office of this art not only to preserve what is found but also to find what is not yet known.”  </blockquote></p><p><hr></p><p><h3><strong>On prayer and magic</strong>  </h3><br>
In his discussion of the higher steps, Bruno insists:  </p><p><blockquote>“Prayer is not petition but contemplation. For the soul, by prayer, aligns itself with the divine.”  </blockquote></p><p><hr></p><p>These are the main <strong>direct Bruno quotations and paraphrased passages</strong> that Clucas reproduces.  </p><p><hr></p><p>Do you want me to <strong>compile these into one continuous document of Bruno’s words (as cited by Clucas)</strong> — almost like a reader’s packet of Bruno’s own voice — or would you like me to <strong>expand them with context from Clucas’s interpretation</strong> alongside each passage?</p>
