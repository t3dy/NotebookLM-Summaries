| <strong>Introduction</strong> | Overview of magical practices in the Latin West with diverse ritual material and theoretical frameworks critiqued. | Highlights the diversity and material richness of Latin West magical practices. | Critiques lingering Victorian evolutionary models framing magic as primitive or vulgar religion. | The Latin West offers a wealth of material for understanding rituals used to interact with supernatural forces. | &quot;The Latin-speaking West offers scholars a gold mine of material remains from diverse rituals...&quot;【5†source】 | Influences of Victorian models of religion and magic. |
| <strong>Etymological Study (James Rives)</strong> | Explores the term &quot;magus&quot; and its evolution in various texts. | Demonstrates nuanced shifts in the term across literary genres. | Challenges static interpretations by showcasing genre-driven term variability. | Terms like &quot;magus&quot; reflect complex, context-dependent meanings. | &quot;Poetic usage may turn out to be exotic...a valuable demonstration of how phrases shift nuance as they move from genre to genre.&quot;【5†source】 | Pliny and poetic sources on term evolution. |
| <strong>Latin Historians on Magic (Matthew Dickie)</strong> | Surveys attitudes toward magic in works by Tacitus, Lucian, and Dio Cassius. | Reveals strategic definitions of magic, often as disapproved religion. | Lack of clarity in mapping ancient terms to modern understandings. | Definitions of magic varied and were often strategically shaped by context. | &quot;Tacitus has what appears to be a totally strategic definition of magic as basically disapproved religion.&quot;【5†source】 | Ancient historians such as Tacitus and Dio Cassius. |
| <strong>Heresy and Maleficium (Maria Victoria Escribano Pano)</strong> | Examines heresy charges in the context of magical accusations. | Connects charges of magic with church efforts to consolidate authority. | The need for deeper exploration of the term &quot;performative&quot; in context. | Magic and heresy reflect contested boundaries of religious authority. | &quot;The contours of charges of magic change as various types of rituals gain or lose clear standing.&quot;【5†source】 | The Codex Theodosianus. |
| <strong>Defixiones Studies (Blånsdorf)</strong> | Analysis of curse tablets (defixiones) from a sanctuary of Isis and Magna Mater. | Extends knowledge on regional worship practices and ritual continuity. | Relies heavily on fragmentary material evidence for interpretation. | Defixiones blend cultural and ritual elements in prayers for justice. | &quot;The full range of literary and material evidence is needed in order to understand the role of Magna Mater.&quot;【5†source】 | Eric Turner and H.

| <strong>Type of Evidence</strong>               | <strong>Description</strong>                                                                                     | <strong>Examples from the Text</strong>                                                                                       | <strong>Relevance to Argument</strong>                                                                                       | <strong>Challenges in Interpretation</strong>                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <strong>Performative Texts</strong>             | Texts considered as active agents in ritual practices, such as charms or codices.                   | Codex Theodosianus as a tool of legal and ritual authority; Visigothic charms from Asturias.                     | Demonstrates the dual role of texts as both legal instruments and magical artifacts.                            | Requires theoretical clarity on &quot;performative&quot; aspects in linguistic and ritual contexts.                         |
| <strong>Liturgical Frameworks</strong>          | Ritual formulas and practices adapted or simplified for accessibility.                              | The &quot;Mithraic Liturgy,&quot; discussed as a potential &quot;short cut&quot; ritual.                                             | Highlights the diversity of ritual practices tailored for practitioners of different social and financial statuses. | Identifying which rituals were genuinely simplified versus misunderstood or misrepresented.                        |
| <strong>Prayer Categories</strong>              | Distinction between prayers for justice and binding spells.                                         | Taxonomy developed by H. S. Versnel; linked to defixiones categorization.                                        | Clarifies functional distinctions in magical texts based on intent and audience.                                 | Establishing boundaries between overlapping categories of ritual expression.                                      |
| <strong>Economic and Social Contexts</strong>   | Material and textual evidence showing the economic accessibility of certain rituals.                | Simplified rituals for those unable to afford complex initiations; cursing rituals accessible to common people.   | Connects the availability of rituals to the social stratification and practical needs of practitioners.          | Risk of conflating economic accessibility with diminished ritual significance.                                    |
| <strong>Mythological and Symbolic Links</strong> | Use of deities and symbolic items to connect practitioners to broader cosmological or local systems. | Magna Mater, Isis, Anna Perenna, and other figures tied to curse tablets and ritual objects.                     | Shows how magical practices reinforced cultural and religious connections.                                       | Differentiating between mythological associations and practical ritual uses.                                      |
| <strong>Shared Regional Practices</strong>      | Evidence of ritual elements that transcended religious boundaries and were shared among communities. | Pagan and Christian continuity at Anna Perenna Fountain; shared curse tablet formulas in Iberia and Britain.     | Demonstrates cultural exchange and mutual influence in ritual traditions.                                        | Defining the extent of shared elements without oversimplifying complex religious dynamics.                         |
| <strong>Temporal Continuities</strong>          | Evidence showing the persistence of certain practices over time, even with changing religious frameworks. | Overlap of pagan and Christian ritual elements; durability of defixiones as a medium for justice.                 | Highlights the adaptability and resilience of magical practices across historical periods.                       | Identifying exact points of transition and the forces driving continuity versus innovation.                        |

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>Here is a table summarizing <strong>scholarly theories of magic</strong> discussed or referenced in the volume:

| <strong>Theorist/Theory</strong>               | <strong>Description</strong>                                                                                     | <strong>Key Features</strong>                                                                                   | <strong>Application in the Volume</strong>                                                                          | <strong>Challenges</strong>                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <strong>Victorian Evolutionary Models</strong> | Treats magic as a primitive precursor to religion, emphasizing its &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;simplistic&quot; nature. | Positions magic as a stage in cultural evolution, leading to organized religion.                 | Critiqued in the introduction for being outdated and overly simplistic.                              | Fails to account for the complexity and continuity of magical practices in sophisticated contexts. |
| <strong>Functionalism (H. S. Versnel)</strong> | Focuses on the social and cultural roles of magical practices, such as resolving disputes or reinforcing social norms. | Divides rituals into categories like &quot;prayers for justice&quot; and &quot;binding spells.&quot;                  | Applied in categorizing defixiones and understanding their use in addressing social grievances.      | Overlaps between categories can blur distinctions, making rigid classification difficult.          |
| <strong>Genealogical Approach (Richard Gordon)</strong> | Examines the historical development and influence of magical practices across regions and cultures. | Emphasizes tracing links between Graeco-Egyptian magical papyri and Latin West rituals.           | Used to explore possible transmission of magical traditions from Egypt to the Roman Empire.          | Proving direct connections is challenging due to fragmentary evidence.                             |
| <strong>Performative Theory</strong>           | Considers magic as enacted through speech acts or symbolic actions that &quot;perform&quot; a transformation. | Views ritual texts, objects, and gestures as active participants in creating change.              | Referenced in discussions of the Codex Theodosianus and its ritualistic legal power.                 | Requires deeper theoretical grounding, particularly in linguistic and cultural specificity.        |
| <strong>Comparative Anthropology (Evans-Pritchard)</strong> | Analyzes magic as a cultural system with its own internal logic, often distinct from Western frameworks. | Treats magical practices as rational within their specific cultural contexts.                     | Provides a lens for understanding how defixiones and other rituals functioned in ancient societies. | Requires caution to avoid projecting modern rationality onto ancient systems.                      |
| <strong>Structuralism (Claude Lévi-Strauss)</strong> | Views magic as a system of symbols that organize and interpret the world.                          | Emphasizes the symbolic and communicative aspects of rituals and objects.                         | Implied in the analysis of poppets, curse tablets, and ritual objects as symbolic tools.            | Symbolism can be highly interpretive and context-dependent, complicating universal application.    |
| <strong>Economic and Social Theories</strong>  | Examines the role of magic in mediating economic and social power dynamics.                         | Suggests that simplified rituals reflect accessibility and stratification within religious systems. | Used to analyze simplified &quot;Mithraic&quot; liturgy and economic variations in ritual participation.       | Risk of reducing ritual practices to purely economic or utilitarian terms.                         |
| <strong>Legal and Bureaucratic Models</strong> | Sees magic as interacting with or mimicking formal legal and bureaucratic systems.                  | Frames rituals as extensions of legal appeals, such as divine enforcement of justice.             | Applied in analyses of Iberian and British curses treating gods as legal administrators.            | Overlaps between legalistic and spiritual motivations can complicate interpretations.              |

| <strong>Binding Magic</strong>                 | Rituals intended to restrict or control the actions of others, often competitors or adversaries.     | Binding spells in defixiones; poppets symbolizing individuals to be restrained.                 | Neutralizes or restricts the influence or abilities of a target.                                     | Determining whether binding acts were symbolic or considered physically effective.               |
| <strong>Protective Magic</strong>              | Rituals or objects designed to guard against harm or misfortune.                                    | Poppets or charms found at Anna Perenna Fountain; consecrated navigation stones for seafarers.  | Ensures safety, particularly in dangerous or uncertain circumstances.                                | Contextualizing the artifacts as protective rather than offensive or neutral ritual items.       |
| <strong>Healing Magic</strong>                 | Practices aimed at curing ailments or improving health.                                             | Suggested in poppets possibly representing therapeutic or apotropaic functions.                 | Provides physical or spiritual remedies to health issues.                                             | Minimal direct evidence for healing-focused rituals in the Latin West.                          |
| <strong>Divination</strong>                    | Techniques for predicting the future or interpreting divine will.                                   | Allusions to omens and divine signs in curse tablets and ritual contexts.                       | Gathers insight into decisions or future outcomes through supernatural means.                       | Sparse evidence directly linking defixiones or ritual objects to divinatory practices.          |
| <strong>Economic Magic</strong>                | Rituals intended to influence wealth, resources, or financial success.                              | Simplified &quot;Mithraic&quot; liturgy interpreted as catering to lower-income participants.             | Adapts rituals for financial accessibility or to achieve economic goals.                             | Risk of overemphasizing economic motivations in ritual simplification.                           |
| <strong>Erotic Magic</strong>                  | Practices aimed at eliciting love, desire, or control in romantic relationships.                     | Referenced in some defixiones and texts involving love or sexual control spells.                | Influences interpersonal or romantic dynamics.                                                        | Lack of specific examples in archaeological or textual records from this volume.                 |
| <strong>Cosmic or Natural Magic</strong>       | Rituals aligning natural forces with divine power to achieve specific goals.                        | Consecrated navigation stones; references to Pliny’s concepts of natural forces.                | Harmonizes divine and natural elements for practical or spiritual outcomes.                          | Interpreting the perceived interaction between natural phenomena and supernatural influence.     |
| <strong>Performative Magic</strong>            | Use of spoken or written rituals to enact change through their inherent &quot;performative&quot; nature.       | Codex Theodosianus as a performative legal and magical text; Visigothic charm texts.             | Creates change through the ritual power of words and symbolic actions.                               | Requires theoretical clarity on what constitutes &quot;performative&quot; in both legal and magical contexts. |
