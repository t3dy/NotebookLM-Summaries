<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>The document you uploaded, *Officina Magica: Essays on the Practice of Magic in Antiquity*, edited by Shaul Shaked, is a collection of scholarly essays exploring ancient magical practices, with a focus on Jewish and Mesopotamian traditions. The book originates from a conference organized by the Institute of Jewish Studies at University College London in 1999. The conference gathered scholars to discuss the continuity and transformation of magical traditions, particularly from ancient Mesopotamia through Late Antiquity and into early medieval periods.

### <strong>Foreword Summary</strong>

The *Foreword* of the book, written by the editor Shaul Shaked, explains that the essays in this volume are the result of that 1999 conference, primarily discussing the transition and survival of magical practices, particularly focusing on the influence of Mesopotamian magic in later cultures such as Jewish magic during the Talmudic period. The book explores various magical traditions, including Aramaic incantation bowls, Zoroastrian omen texts, Jewish mystical traditions, and magical artifacts from Late Antiquity.

The *Foreword* introduces the range of topics covered in the book, emphasizing the scholarly inquiry into the definition, phenomenon, and societal role of magic. It highlights the influence of earlier Mesopotamian magic on Jewish magic practices, focusing on the question of how magic from Babylonian culture carried through into later periods, particularly through objects like magical bowls and incantation texts. 

It also addresses the work done on deciphering Aramaic incantation bowls, a significant project under the auspices of University College London’s Department of Hebrew and Jewish Studies. The project involved the study of texts in different forms of Aramaic (Jewish Aramaic, Mandaic, Syriac), and the decoding of artificial scripts, some resembling Pahlavi. The *Foreword* notes the scholarly collaboration on this project, including contributions from Dan Levene and others, pointing to the importance of understanding magic within its social and religious contexts.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;Form and Purpose in Aramaic Spells: Some Jewish Themes&quot; by Shaul Shaked</strong> (Part 1)

This essay, written by Shaul Shaked, discusses the nature and structure of Jewish magical texts from Babylonia, focusing on Aramaic incantations found in magic bowls from the Sasanian period (late Talmudic era). These magic texts, though not fully integrated into canonical Jewish religious literature, reflect significant cultural and religious syncretism between Jewish, Mesopotamian, and broader regional magical traditions. Shaked draws from about 800 newly available texts from the Schøyen Collection and other collections, although many of them are still in preliminary stages of interpretation.

The essay primarily investigates Jewish magical motifs and their relationship to common religious themes of the period. Shaked points out that Jewish magic texts, while rooted in Jewish traditions, also incorporated elements from broader popular religious practices, often involving syncretic deities, demons, and ritual practices. The relationship between these magical texts and mainstream religious practices, particularly in Judaism, is complex; while some texts overlap with liturgical practices or scriptural traditions, others exist on the margins, forming a kind of &quot;unofficial&quot; religious literature that was never fully sanctioned by religious authorities.

#### <strong>Themes in Jewish Magic</strong>
Shaked notes that the magic texts often drew upon recognizable Jewish elements such as scriptural quotations and Hebrew phrases, particularly in the form of biblical verses that were used as incantations. One distinguishing feature of Jewish magical texts is the presence of Hebrew mixed with Aramaic, where biblical quotations are presented in their original Hebrew (sometimes paraphrased in Aramaic). These texts were likely memorized rather than copied from written sources, as indicated by minor variations in spelling and phrasing, reflecting an oral tradition of transmission.

One of the key aspects of this essay is the examination of specifically Jewish themes in these incantations, including:
- <strong>Divine names and figures</strong>: The Jewish magical texts frequently invoke the names of biblical figures, Jewish mystical concepts, and angels, such as Joshua ben Peraḥya, who is associated with magical practices like issuing a divorce for demons.
- <strong>Biblical citations</strong>: The texts often quote from the Hebrew Bible, though the quotations are sometimes imprecise, suggesting that they were derived from oral memory rather than written texts. For example, one of the texts cites Mishnaic texts, presenting them as powerful names or sacred formulas that could be invoked for magical purposes.

#### <strong>Jewish and Syncretic Elements</strong>
Shaked discusses the syncretic nature of these magical texts, pointing out that although they are Jewish in origin, they also incorporate elements from neighboring cultures, particularly Mesopotamian magic. This blending is most visible in the use of shared symbols, deities, and ritual practices, which point to a larger, regional popular religion that transcended the boundaries of official religious institutions like synagogues or churches.

For instance, while the Jewish Aramaic magic bowls are written in Hebrew characters and use Hebrew phrases, they also include references to local deities and demons from non-Jewish traditions. These syncretic texts were part of a broader magical tradition that was likely practiced by various religious communities, including Jews, Mandaeans, and Christians.

#### <strong>Popular vs. Normative Religion</strong>
A major point of discussion in the essay is the distinction between popular religion and normative religion in Jewish culture. While normative Jewish texts (like the Talmud) occasionally mention magic, they generally regard it with suspicion or dismiss it as marginal. However, Shaked argues that some of the magical practices found in these texts may have been carried out by learned members of the Jewish community, including rabbis, even though these practices were not part of mainstream religious rites.

Shaked provides examples of formulas and practices that are unique to the Jewish magical tradition but do not appear in mainstream religious texts. One prominent example is the Jewish practice of serving a divorce to demons, a concept derived from Jewish legal practice but reinterpreted in a magical context.

#### <strong>The Role of Magical Texts in Jewish Culture</strong>
The essay highlights how these magical texts reveal a layer of Jewish religious practice that was largely outside the purview of the rabbinical authorities. Although Jewish magic was not formally integrated into the religious canon, it nevertheless played a role in the lives of ordinary Jews, particularly in times of personal distress, illness, or demonic possession. These spells, incantations, and magical practices were part of a popular religious tradition that ran parallel to, and occasionally intersected with, formal Jewish religious life.

Shaked also explores how Jewish magical texts borrowed from other religious traditions, including Mandaean and Christian sources, reflecting the fluid boundaries between religious communities in Sasanian Babylonia. This cultural exchange is especially evident in the similarities between Jewish and Mandaean magic bowls, both of which use Aramaic incantations written in their respective scripts but share common themes and motifs.

#### <strong>Jewish Magical Texts and Scriptural Citations</strong>
Shaked highlights the frequent use of scriptural citations in Jewish magical texts, noting that biblical verses, particularly from the Hebrew Bible, were commonly invoked as magical formulas. These quotations were often used in contexts that had little to do with their original scriptural meaning but were thought to carry protective or healing power due to their sacred nature. In addition to biblical texts, the incantation bowls often included references to Jewish religious figures, such as Joshua ben Peraḥya, and to elements of Jewish legal tradition, such as the concept of serving a &quot;divorce&quot; to demons.

The use of scriptural texts in these magic practices was not limited to the Hebrew Bible. Shaked points out that even Mishnaic texts, which are rabbinical legal teachings, were sometimes employed in magical contexts. One of the magic bowls, for example, contains a full passage from *Mishna Zevaḥim* 5:3, which details the ritual procedures for animal sacrifices in the Jerusalem Temple. This text is not presented as a religious instruction, but rather as a &quot;powerful name&quot; that could be invoked in a magical context, showing how deeply embedded the idea of ritual power was in the Jewish imagination.

Interestingly, these scriptural and Mishnaic quotations were not necessarily used with precision. Variations in spelling and wording indicate that many of the texts were recited from memory, with a degree of fluidity in transmission. This suggests that the practitioners of magic were familiar with Jewish religious traditions, but they were not necessarily copying from written texts. Instead, they drew on an oral tradition of reciting and adapting sacred texts for magical purposes.

#### <strong>Magical Practitioners and Their Clients</strong>
One of the important themes in Shaked&#x27;s analysis is the role of the magical practitioner and their relationship with their clients. The magical texts suggest that practitioners were individuals who had a deep knowledge of Jewish religious texts and practices, but they were also familiar with the magical traditions of other cultures. These practitioners often served a diverse clientele, including Jews, Christians, and pagans, which is evident from the variety of names and cultural references found in the magic bowls.

Shaked provides examples of incantation bowls commissioned by individuals with non-Jewish names, suggesting that Jewish magical practitioners were sought after by clients from various backgrounds. For instance, one of the texts he examines was prepared for a client named Adib, whose name is not Jewish but may be of Arabic origin. The bowl includes a prayer formula that invokes Jewish religious themes, but it is clear that the client was not necessarily Jewish. Similarly, many of the names mentioned in the bowls are Persian or Semitic, reflecting the multicultural environment of Sasanian Babylonia.

The syncretism in these texts is further highlighted by the fact that Jewish magical practitioners did not hesitate to use Jewish sacred texts and religious symbols in the service of non-Jewish clients. This indicates a certain pragmatism in the practice of magic, where religious boundaries were fluid, and the efficacy of the spell was more important than the strict adherence to religious orthodoxy.

#### <strong>Jewish Mystical and Magical Traditions</strong>
A significant portion of the essay is devoted to exploring the relationship between Jewish magic and early Jewish mystical traditions, particularly the *Hekhalot* literature. The *Hekhalot* texts, which describe mystical journeys through the heavenly palaces (*hekhalot*), are closely connected with Jewish magical practices. Shaked points out that some of the incantation bowls contain elements that are reminiscent of *Hekhalot* literature, such as the use of divine names and angelic figures.

One example is the appearance of mystical angel names in the magic bowls. These names, which are often associated with the *Merkavah* (divine chariot) and *Hekhalot* mysticism, were invoked in magical contexts as powerful protective or healing forces. Shaked notes that the boundary between mystical experience and magical practice was often blurred, with both traditions drawing on similar symbols, names, and concepts.

The essay also touches on the use of angelic figures in Jewish magical texts. Angels were frequently invoked as intermediaries between the human and divine realms, capable of providing protection, healing, and guidance. The presence of these angelic figures in both *Hekhalot* literature and Jewish magical texts points to a shared worldview in which supernatural beings played a central role in mediating between the divine and human realms.

#### <strong>Structure and Purpose of Aramaic Spells</strong>
Shaked delves into the structure of Aramaic spells, noting that while many of the incantations share common elements, they also exhibit significant variation in form and length. Some spells are brief and focused on a single theme, while others are longer and more elaborate, incorporating multiple layers of ritual language and symbolism. The overall structure of these spells often includes the following elements:
- <strong>Introduction</strong>: A statement of purpose, typically involving the invocation of divine or angelic figures to protect the client from harm.
- <strong>Main Body</strong>: The recitation of powerful names, biblical verses, or mystical formulas that are believed to have protective or healing power. In some cases, the main body of the spell consists entirely of a quotation from a sacred text, which is presented as a magical formula.
- <strong>Closing</strong>: A concluding section that often includes phrases like &quot;Amen, Amen, Selah&quot; and sometimes involves further adjurations or the repetition of key phrases from the main body of the spell.

One striking example is a spell that includes a quotation from *Mishna Zevaḥim* describing the sacrificial procedures in the Jerusalem Temple. This text, which would ordinarily be part of a religious ritual, is here repurposed as a magical formula. The use of such texts highlights the close connection between Jewish ritual practice and magical thought, where religious rites could be transformed into tools for personal protection and healing.

Shaked emphasizes that the Jewish magical texts were often adapted to fit the specific needs of the client. For example, some spells were designed to heal physical ailments, while others aimed to protect against demonic forces or to ensure success in legal disputes. The flexibility of these texts allowed them to be customized for a wide range of purposes, reflecting the practical concerns of the individuals who sought out magical assistance.

The essay concludes with an exploration of the social and cultural contexts in which these magical texts were produced and used. Shaked suggests that the widespread use of magical texts in Late Antiquity reflects a broader cultural phenomenon in which religious boundaries were fluid, and magical practices were integrated into everyday life. Jewish magical practitioners, while drawing on their own religious traditions, were also part of a larger network of magical knowledge that transcended religious and cultural boundaries.

#### <strong>The Role of Jewish Themes in Syncretic Magic</strong>
Shaked continues by exploring how specific Jewish elements were adapted into broader, syncretic magical traditions. The Jewish magical texts often incorporated distinctively Jewish symbols and practices, but they also existed alongside non-Jewish magical traditions in Mesopotamia, resulting in a rich syncretism. Jewish practitioners, although rooted in their religious traditions, shared magical techniques and concepts with their non-Jewish neighbors. This syncretism is particularly evident in the use of shared magical tools, such as incantation bowls, and in the invocation of a wide range of deities and demons from both Jewish and non-Jewish traditions.

Shaked argues that the syncretic nature of these magical practices reflects the broader cultural environment of Sasanian Babylonia, where religious and cultural boundaries were often fluid. The Aramaic spells examined in this essay show that Jewish practitioners were not only drawing on their own religious texts and traditions but were also borrowing from the popular magical practices of the region. This blending of traditions highlights the permeability of religious boundaries in the ancient world, where magical practitioners often served a diverse clientele and adapted their practices to meet the needs of different communities.

#### <strong>The Use of Angelic Figures and Mystical Names</strong>
Angels played a central role in Jewish magical texts, often appearing as powerful intermediaries who could be invoked to provide protection, healing, or guidance. Shaked notes that angelic figures were a prominent feature of both Jewish magic and Jewish mysticism, particularly in the *Merkavah* and *Hekhalot* traditions, which describe mystical journeys through the heavens and encounters with angelic beings.

In the magical texts, angels are frequently invoked by name, often with titles or attributes that emphasize their protective or healing powers. For example, angels like Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel are commonly mentioned in Jewish magical spells, reflecting their role as guardians and healers in Jewish religious tradition. In some cases, the angels are invoked to protect the client from demonic forces or evil spirits, while in others, they are called upon to heal physical ailments or bring success in personal endeavors.

Shaked also points out that the names of angels were often treated as magical names in their own right, capable of exerting power over demons or other supernatural beings. These angelic names, sometimes drawn from Jewish mystical traditions, were incorporated into magical formulas and used as part of the incantations. The invocation of these names reflects a belief in the inherent power of divine or angelic names, a concept that is central to both Jewish mysticism and magic.

#### <strong>The Role of the Temple and Sacrificial Rites in Magic</strong>
Another major theme in Shaked&#x27;s essay is the connection between Jewish sacrificial practices, particularly those associated with the Jerusalem Temple, and Jewish magical traditions. Several of the Aramaic spells examined in this essay invoke elements of Jewish sacrificial rites, particularly the procedures for offering animal sacrifices as described in the Bible and the Mishnah.

For example, one of the incantation bowls includes a quotation from *Mishna Zevaḥim* 5:3, which details the procedures for offering sin sacrifices in the Temple. The text describes how the priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the altar and pour the remaining blood on the base of the altar. In the context of the magic bowl, this passage is used as part of a spell to protect the client from demonic forces, with the sacrificial rites being invoked as a powerful, protective act.

Shaked argues that the use of sacrificial rites in these magical texts reflects the belief that the Temple, and the rituals associated with it, had a unique power to protect individuals from harm. Even after the destruction of the Temple, the memory of its sacrificial practices remained a potent symbol in Jewish religious and magical thought. By invoking these rites in a magical context, practitioners were able to draw on the perceived power of the Temple to provide protection and healing.

The connection between the Temple and Jewish magic is also evident in the use of specific Temple-related objects and symbols in magical spells. For example, the incantation bowls sometimes refer to sacred objects, such as the altar or the vessels used in the Temple, as part of the magical formulas. These references suggest that the practitioners of Jewish magic believed that the holiness of the Temple, and the objects associated with it, could be harnessed for magical purposes.

#### <strong>Magical Stories and Historiolae in Jewish Spells</strong>
A key feature of Jewish magical texts is the use of *historiolae*—short narratives or anecdotes that recount magical stories involving biblical figures or other legendary characters. These stories often serve as the foundation for the magical act, providing a precedent for the desired outcome. By retelling a story in which a magical or miraculous event occurred, the practitioner hopes to replicate the same result for the client.

Shaked provides several examples of *historiolae* from Jewish magical texts, many of which involve well-known figures from Jewish religious tradition, such as Moses, King Solomon, or Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa. One common type of *historiola* involves a figure confronting and overcoming a demon or evil spirit, thereby providing a model for the magical act. For example, one of the incantation bowls recounts a story in which Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa encounters a female demon and successfully drives her away by quoting a biblical verse. This story serves as a magical precedent for the practitioner, who recites the same verse in the hope that it will have the same effect in the present situation.

The use of *historiolae* in Jewish magical texts is closely related to the idea of magical precedent—that is, the belief that by recounting a story in which a magical act was successfully performed, the same outcome can be achieved in the present. This concept is not unique to Jewish magic but is found in many magical traditions around the world. However, in the Jewish context, these stories often involve biblical or rabbinic figures, reflecting the deep connection between Jewish religious and magical thought.

#### <strong>Conclusion of the Essay</strong>
In concluding the essay, Shaked reflects on the broader implications of the Jewish magical texts for our understanding of Jewish religious and cultural history. He argues that these texts provide valuable insight into the popular religious practices of Jews in Late Antiquity, particularly those that existed outside the formal structures of the synagogue or rabbinical authority. The magical texts reveal a side of Jewish life that was deeply connected to broader cultural and religious currents in the ancient world, including the syncretic magical traditions of Mesopotamia and the surrounding regions.

Shaked emphasizes that while Jewish magic was not part of the official religious canon, it played an important role in the lives of ordinary Jews, particularly in times of illness, danger, or personal crisis. These magical practices, though often dismissed by religious authorities, reflect a popular form of Jewish piety that sought to draw on the power of sacred texts, divine names, and religious symbols to provide protection and healing.

The essay also highlights the fluid boundaries between religious and magical practices in the ancient world, where Jewish magic was influenced by and, in turn, influenced the magical traditions of other cultures. This syncretism is evident in the shared use of magical tools, such as incantation bowls, and in the blending of Jewish and non-Jewish elements in the spells themselves.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;Magical Piety and the ‘Great Angel’&quot; by Michael G. Morony</strong> (Part 1)

This essay by Michael G. Morony explores the concept of &quot;magical piety&quot; in Late Antiquity, focusing on the figure of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; an important divine intermediary in both Jewish and non-Jewish magical traditions. The essay delves into the ways in which angels, particularly the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; were invoked in magical contexts, highlighting their role as protectors and intercessors for individuals seeking divine intervention in times of distress.

#### <strong>The Role of Angels in Magical Practice</strong>
Morony begins by discussing the significance of angels in the magical and religious practices of Late Antiquity. Angels were often invoked as powerful supernatural beings who could act as intermediaries between humans and the divine. In both Jewish and Christian traditions, angels played an important role as messengers, protectors, and healers. Their presence in magical texts reflects a belief that these beings possessed the ability to intervene in human affairs, particularly in situations involving illness, demonic possession, or personal misfortune.

One of the central themes in Morony&#x27;s essay is the figure of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; who appears frequently in magical texts from Late Antiquity. This angel, often identified with Michael or Metatron, was considered the highest-ranking angel in the celestial hierarchy and was believed to possess extraordinary power. The &quot;Great Angel&quot; was frequently invoked in magical spells and incantations, particularly those seeking protection or healing.

Morony highlights that the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was often viewed as the ultimate guardian, capable of protecting individuals from demonic forces and other supernatural threats. In many cases, the invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was combined with the recitation of biblical verses or divine names, further emphasizing the connection between religious and magical practices.

#### <strong>The Syncretism of Angelic Figures</strong>
A significant portion of the essay is dedicated to examining the syncretism of angelic figures in magical traditions. Morony points out that while the figure of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; has its roots in Jewish religious traditions, it was also incorporated into the magical practices of other cultures, including Christian and pagan traditions. This blending of religious and magical elements is particularly evident in the way that angels were invoked alongside other deities and supernatural beings.

For example, in some magical texts, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is invoked alongside pagan gods or goddesses, suggesting that practitioners of magic in Late Antiquity were not bound by strict religious orthodoxy. Instead, they drew on a wide range of supernatural beings, regardless of their religious origin, in order to achieve their desired outcomes. This syncretism reflects the fluid boundaries between different religious traditions in the ancient world, where magical practitioners often borrowed freely from various religious sources.

Morony also notes that the figure of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; underwent significant development over time, with different traditions attributing different characteristics and powers to this angelic figure. In Jewish mystical traditions, for example, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was often identified with Metatron, a powerful angelic figure associated with the divine throne. In Christian traditions, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was frequently identified with Michael, the archangel who led the heavenly armies against the forces of evil.

#### <strong>The Connection Between Magical Piety and Religious Practice</strong>
Morony&#x27;s essay emphasizes the close connection between magical piety and religious practice in Late Antiquity. While magical practices were often viewed with suspicion by religious authorities, they were nevertheless deeply intertwined with the religious beliefs and practices of the time. The invocation of angels, particularly the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; reflects a form of popular piety that sought to draw on the power of supernatural beings for protection and healing.

Morony argues that magical piety was not necessarily distinct from religious piety but was instead a complementary form of devotion that existed alongside more formal religious practices. The individuals who invoked the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in magical spells were often devout believers who sought divine assistance in times of need. Their use of magical practices did not indicate a rejection of religious authority but rather an attempt to access divine power in a more immediate and personal way.

This blending of magic and religion is particularly evident in the use of biblical texts and religious symbols in magical spells. Morony provides several examples of magical texts that incorporate quotations from the Bible, particularly the Psalms, as part of their incantations. These texts were often used in combination with the invocation of angels, creating a powerful fusion of religious and magical elements.

#### <strong>Magical Texts and the Role of the ‘Great Angel’</strong>
The essay continues by examining specific magical texts that invoke the &quot;Great Angel&quot; and other angelic figures. Morony highlights the wide range of magical practices in which the &quot;Great Angel&quot; played a central role, including spells for protection, healing, and exorcism. In many of these texts, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is invoked as a powerful protector who can ward off demonic forces and evil spirits.

One example of this is a magical text that invokes the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to protect the client from illness and demonic possession. The spell includes the recitation of divine names, along with a plea for the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to intervene on behalf of the client. The text reflects a belief in the power of angels to act as intermediaries between humans and the divine, providing protection and healing in times of distress.

Another text examined by Morony involves the use of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in an exorcism ritual. In this spell, the practitioner calls upon the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to drive out an evil spirit that has possessed the client. The invocation of the angel is combined with the recitation of biblical verses, creating a powerful ritual that draws on both religious and magical elements.

#### <strong>Conclusion of Part 1</strong>
In this first part of the essay, Morony establishes the central role of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in magical piety during Late Antiquity. The figure of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; often identified with Michael or Metatron, was a key figure in magical practices, particularly those involving protection, healing, and exorcism. Morony argues that the invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; reflects a form of popular piety that was deeply connected to religious beliefs, even as it incorporated elements of magical practice.

The essay also highlights the syncretism of magical traditions in Late Antiquity, where practitioners freely borrowed from various religious sources, including Jewish, Christian, and pagan traditions. This syncretism is particularly evident in the figure of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; who was invoked alongside other deities and supernatural beings in magical spells.

Morony&#x27;s analysis provides valuable insight into the ways in which magical piety functioned in the ancient world, revealing the close relationship between religious and magical practices and the central role of angels in both. In the next part of the essay, Morony will explore additional examples of magical texts and further examine the role of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in the broader context of magical and religious piety.

#### <strong>Further Examination of Magical Texts Involving the &#x27;Great Angel&#x27;</strong>
In this section, Morony continues to delve into specific magical texts that involve the invocation of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; expanding on the variety of contexts in which this angelic figure appears. One of the key points he emphasizes is the versatility of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in magical practice—he could be called upon for a range of purposes, from personal protection to the exorcism of evil spirits, and from healing physical ailments to ensuring success in legal or social matters.

One example Morony provides is a spell designed to protect an individual from malicious spirits or harmful demons. The practitioner recites the names of powerful angels, including the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; alongside divine names and biblical verses that have been repurposed for magical use. The text reflects a belief in the power of angels to create a protective barrier around the client, warding off unseen dangers. This highlights a key feature of magical piety in Late Antiquity: the seamless integration of religious and magical elements, with figures from Jewish and Christian theology being invoked in spells alongside traditional magical formulas.

Another significant example is a healing incantation in which the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is invoked to cure illness. In this text, the practitioner appeals to the angel&#x27;s power to heal physical ailments, often in combination with the recitation of specific verses from the Psalms, which were believed to have inherent healing properties. The combination of angelic intervention and biblical authority shows how magical practices were perceived as an extension of religious piety, where supernatural beings acted as divine agents capable of addressing both spiritual and physical needs.

#### <strong>The Syncretic Nature of Angelic Invocation</strong>
A key theme throughout this section is the syncretic nature of angelic invocation, which Morony revisits as he examines the blending of Jewish, Christian, and pagan traditions in the magical texts of Late Antiquity. He explains that the figure of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was not confined to a single religious tradition but was instead a shared figure across various religious and magical systems. The &quot;Great Angel&quot; could be identified with Michael in some Jewish and Christian texts, while in other magical traditions, the same figure might be associated with Metatron or other angelic beings.

Morony points out that the angelic figures in these texts often exhibit traits that are common to both Jewish and non-Jewish magical traditions. For instance, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is sometimes depicted as a warrior figure, wielding divine power to combat demonic forces, a role that is characteristic of Michael in Christian and Jewish theology. However, in other cases, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; takes on a more mystical role, acting as a guide for the practitioner or as an intermediary between the human and divine realms, a role more commonly associated with figures like Metatron in Jewish mysticism.

This syncretism is further illustrated by the inclusion of non-Jewish and non-Christian deities in magical texts alongside the &quot;Great Angel.&quot; In some spells, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is invoked alongside traditional Mesopotamian or Greco-Roman deities, reflecting the cultural and religious fluidity of the time. Morony notes that this blending of traditions was not seen as contradictory by the practitioners, who viewed magic as a pragmatic tool that drew on whatever sources of power were available, regardless of their religious origin.

#### <strong>The Role of the &#x27;Great Angel&#x27; in Exorcism Rituals</strong>
Exorcism is another area where the &quot;Great Angel&quot; frequently appears in magical texts. Morony examines several exorcism rituals in which the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is invoked to cast out evil spirits or demons that are believed to have possessed an individual. In these texts, the angel is portrayed as a powerful protector, capable of driving away harmful forces and restoring the individual to health and wholeness.

One of the most notable examples is an exorcism text in which the practitioner calls upon the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to intervene on behalf of a possessed person. The ritual involves the recitation of both angelic and divine names, along with specific adjurations commanding the evil spirit to leave the body of the afflicted individual. The &quot;Great Angel&quot; is depicted as the ultimate authority in this battle between good and evil, wielding divine power to subdue and expel the demonic force.

Morony emphasizes that these exorcism rituals often combined elements of religious and magical practice. The invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in these rituals was closely tied to the religious belief in angelic protection, but it was also part of a broader magical tradition that viewed exorcism as a form of supernatural intervention. The presence of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in these texts underscores the role of angels as intermediaries between the divine and human realms, capable of acting on behalf of individuals in need of spiritual or physical healing.

#### <strong>Magical Piety and the Use of Biblical Texts</strong>
Morony also examines the role of biblical texts in magical piety, focusing on how scriptural passages were repurposed for magical use. In many of the magical texts he analyzes, biblical verses—particularly from the Psalms—are invoked as part of the magical formula. These verses were believed to carry inherent power, and their recitation was thought to invoke divine protection or healing.

For example, Psalm 91, which speaks of God&#x27;s protection from harm, was frequently used in magical texts as a protective charm. Practitioners would recite the psalm in conjunction with the names of angels, including the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; to create a shield of protection around the client. The use of biblical texts in this way reflects the close relationship between religious and magical practices in Late Antiquity, where sacred texts were seen as powerful tools that could be harnessed for both spiritual and practical purposes.

Morony points out that the use of biblical texts in magical practice was not limited to Jewish or Christian traditions. Pagan practitioners also incorporated scriptural verses into their magical formulas, viewing them as potent symbols of divine authority. This further highlights the syncretic nature of magical practice in Late Antiquity, where practitioners drew on a wide range of religious traditions to create powerful magical rituals.

#### <strong>Conclusion of Part 2</strong>
In this second part of the essay, Morony continues to explore the central role of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in magical piety during Late Antiquity, focusing on the angel&#x27;s involvement in protection, healing, and exorcism rituals. The essay highlights the syncretic nature of magical practice in this period, where the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was invoked alongside figures from both Jewish and non-Jewish traditions, reflecting the cultural and religious fluidity of the time.

Morony&#x27;s analysis underscores the close relationship between religious and magical practices, particularly in the use of biblical texts as part of magical rituals. The invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; and the recitation of scriptural verses demonstrate how magical practitioners sought to draw on both religious and magical sources of power to achieve their desired outcomes.

#### <strong>The &#x27;Great Angel&#x27; in Legal and Social Matters</strong>
In this section, Morony explores how the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was not only invoked for personal protection and healing but also for success in legal disputes and social matters. In Late Antiquity, magical texts sometimes incorporated the &quot;Great Angel&quot; as a supernatural advocate who could influence the outcome of legal proceedings or interpersonal conflicts.

Morony examines a series of texts in which individuals sought divine intervention through the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to resolve disputes or gain favor in social interactions. These magical texts often included prayers or spells asking the angel to intercede on the individual&#x27;s behalf, ensuring justice or swaying the opinions of judges and other authorities in their favor. This aspect of magical practice reflects the broader belief in the ability of supernatural forces to shape human affairs, particularly in situations where the individual felt powerless or in need of external assistance.

For instance, in one text, a petitioner calls upon the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to protect them from false accusations in a legal trial. The spell includes an invocation of angelic names, along with a plea for the angel to &quot;stand before the judge&quot; and ensure that the truth is revealed. This reflects the notion that angels, especially the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; were seen as agents of divine justice who could intervene in human legal systems.

Morony notes that this type of magical petition for legal or social favor was not unique to Jewish or Christian traditions. Similar spells can be found in pagan magical practices, where gods or spirits were invoked to influence legal outcomes or interpersonal relationships. The presence of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in these texts highlights the syncretic nature of magical practice in Late Antiquity, where supernatural beings from different religious traditions were invoked for practical, everyday purposes.

#### <strong>The &#x27;Great Angel&#x27; as a Mediator of Divine Power</strong>
Morony further elaborates on the role of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; as a mediator of divine power. In many magical texts, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; acts as an intermediary between the petitioner and the divine, conveying prayers or requests to higher supernatural powers. This concept is rooted in the religious belief that angels serve as messengers of God, but in magical practice, this role was expanded to include more direct intervention in human affairs.

The essay explores how the invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; often involved the recitation of divine names or the use of mystical formulas believed to enhance the angel&#x27;s power. These names and formulas were drawn from a variety of religious sources, including Jewish, Christian, and pagan traditions, further emphasizing the syncretic nature of magical practice.

One of the key features of these magical texts is the use of secret or mystical names of God, which were believed to have special power when invoked in conjunction with the &quot;Great Angel.&quot; Morony discusses how practitioners believed that by uttering these names, they could tap into divine power, which the angel would then mediate on their behalf. This practice reflects the broader belief in the power of words and names in magical traditions, where the correct use of sacred language was seen as essential for achieving the desired outcome.

#### <strong>The &#x27;Great Angel&#x27; and Protection from Demonic Forces</strong>
Protection from demonic forces is one of the most prominent themes in the magical texts involving the &quot;Great Angel.&quot; Morony dedicates significant attention to the various ways in which the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was invoked to shield individuals from demons, evil spirits, or other malevolent supernatural beings. In these texts, the angel is portrayed as a powerful protector who can repel harmful forces and provide safety for the petitioner.

One example Morony analyzes is a magical text in which the &quot;Great Angel&quot; is called upon to guard the petitioner from a specific type of demon known as the *shedim*. These demons, often associated with illness or misfortune, were believed to have the power to harm individuals or disrupt their lives. The text includes an elaborate invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; to form a protective barrier around the individual, preventing the demon from causing harm.

The invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; for protection was often combined with other magical elements, such as the drawing of protective symbols or the use of amulets inscribed with angelic names. These symbols and amulets were believed to enhance the angel&#x27;s protective power, creating a physical manifestation of the magical act. Morony notes that the use of such protective items was common in both Jewish and non-Jewish magical traditions, reflecting a shared belief in the ability of objects to serve as conduits for supernatural protection.

#### <strong>The Transformation of the &#x27;Great Angel&#x27; in Later Traditions</strong>
As Morony moves toward the conclusion of his essay, he explores how the figure of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; evolved in later magical and religious traditions. He argues that the &quot;Great Angel&quot; continued to be a central figure in medieval Jewish and Christian magical practices, but his role and attributes underwent significant transformation over time.

In Jewish mystical traditions, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; became increasingly associated with Metatron, a powerful angelic figure who was believed to serve as God&#x27;s heavenly scribe and the ruler of the angels. Metatron&#x27;s role as an intermediary between God and humanity was emphasized in Jewish mystical texts, particularly in the *Merkavah* and *Hekhalot* literature, where he is often depicted as the highest-ranking angel in the celestial hierarchy.

In Christian traditions, the &quot;Great Angel&quot; was often identified with Michael, the archangel who led the heavenly armies in the battle against Satan. Michael&#x27;s role as a protector and warrior figure was further developed in medieval Christian iconography and theology, where he was frequently depicted as the defender of the faithful against demonic forces. Morony notes that this portrayal of Michael as a warrior angel reflects the ongoing influence of magical traditions, where angels were invoked for protection and exorcism.

Morony concludes by suggesting that the figure of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; represents a key point of continuity between ancient magical practices and later religious traditions. The angel&#x27;s role as a mediator of divine power, a protector against demonic forces, and an advocate for justice remained central in both Jewish and Christian magical texts, even as the figure was transformed over time.

#### <strong>Conclusion of the Essay</strong>
In his conclusion, Morony emphasizes the importance of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in the magical and religious practices of Late Antiquity. The figure of the &quot;Great Angel,&quot; whether identified as Michael, Metatron, or another angelic figure, served as a powerful intermediary between the human and divine realms. The angel&#x27;s ability to protect, heal, and intervene in human affairs made him a central figure in both Jewish and non-Jewish magical traditions.

Morony&#x27;s analysis highlights the syncretic nature of magical practice in Late Antiquity, where angels, gods, and supernatural beings from various religious traditions were invoked together in magical spells. This syncretism reflects the fluid boundaries between religious and magical practices in the ancient world, where practitioners sought to harness whatever sources of power were available to them.

The essay also underscores the close relationship between magical piety and religious belief in Late Antiquity. While magical practices were often viewed with suspicion by religious authorities, they were nevertheless deeply intertwined with popular religious devotion. The invocation of the &quot;Great Angel&quot; in magical texts reveals a form of piety that sought direct, personal access to divine power, whether for protection, healing, or justice.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;Angels in the Magic of Late Antiquity&quot; by Gideon Bohak</strong> (pgs. 33–53)

This chapter, written by Gideon Bohak, focuses on the role of angels in the magical practices of Late Antiquity, particularly in Jewish and Christian traditions. Bohak investigates how angels were invoked in magical rituals and how their roles evolved from their earlier biblical and mystical representations to become prominent figures in magical practices.

#### <strong>The Role of Angels in Jewish Magical Texts</strong>
Bohak begins by discussing the central role that angels played in Jewish magical traditions, particularly in the incantation bowls and magical amulets from Late Antiquity. These texts frequently invoked angels as protective beings, intermediaries between humans and the divine, or as agents capable of delivering divine assistance. Angels such as Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel are commonly mentioned, and they appear in various magical contexts, including healing spells, exorcisms, and protective charms.

The author points out that these Jewish magical texts often utilized angelic names derived from both the Hebrew Bible and extra-biblical traditions. The names of angels were believed to carry inherent power, and invoking them was thought to ensure the success of the magical act. For example, the figure of Metatron, a prominent angel in Jewish mysticism, was frequently invoked in magical texts, where he was associated with the divine throne and seen as an intermediary between God and humanity.

#### <strong>Christian Adoption of Angelic Magic</strong>
Bohak explores how Christian magical texts from Late Antiquity adopted and adapted the Jewish tradition of angelic invocation. Early Christian magical papyri, for example, include numerous references to angelic beings, often drawing directly from Jewish traditions. The figure of Michael, in particular, became central to Christian angelology and was frequently invoked in Christian magical texts for protection and exorcism.

In some instances, Christian magical texts incorporated a broader pantheon of angels, blending elements of Greco-Roman and Jewish angelic lore. These texts reveal a syncretic approach to angelic magic, where different traditions were harmonized into a cohesive system. For example, angels were invoked alongside divine names and figures from the classical pantheon, reflecting the fluid boundaries between religious and magical practice in Late Antiquity.

#### <strong>The Structure of Angelic Invocations</strong>
A key focus of this chapter is the analysis of the structure of angelic invocations in magical texts. Bohak notes that many of these texts follow a common pattern, beginning with a direct invocation of the angel by name, followed by a request for assistance. In some cases, the angel is addressed with elaborate titles and descriptions of their powers, emphasizing their role as a divine agent. This reflects the belief that angels, by virtue of their closeness to God, possessed the power to influence human affairs and intervene in moments of crisis.

Bohak provides examples from magical papyri and incantation bowls where angels are invoked for a wide range of purposes, including healing, protection from evil spirits, and success in legal disputes. One example comes from a Greek magical papyrus where the angel Michael is invoked to provide protection against demonic forces. The invocation includes both biblical and extra-biblical references to Michael&#x27;s role as a warrior angel, highlighting his protective powers.

#### <strong>Angels and the Names of God</strong>
The chapter also explores the relationship between angels and the divine names, which were often invoked together in magical rituals. In Jewish magical texts, angels were frequently invoked alongside the tetragrammaton (YHWH) or other divine names, reinforcing their connection to the divine. In Christian magical texts, the name of Jesus or the Holy Trinity was often invoked alongside angelic beings.

Bohak highlights how the use of divine names in conjunction with angelic invocations was believed to enhance the efficacy of the magical act. The combination of angelic and divine names reflected the belief that the power of the angels derived from their association with God, and invoking both ensured the practitioner&#x27;s success in summoning supernatural aid.

#### <strong>The Popularity of Angelic Magic</strong>
Bohak concludes the chapter by discussing the widespread popularity of angelic magic in Late Antiquity. He argues that the frequent appearance of angels in both Jewish and Christian magical texts indicates that angelic magic was a significant aspect of popular religious practice during this period. The belief in the power of angels to intervene in human affairs was deeply ingrained in the religious consciousness of Late Antiquity, and this belief was reflected in the magical texts that invoked their assistance.

The chapter also touches on the tensions between official religious authorities and popular magical practices involving angels. While angels were accepted figures in both Jewish and Christian theology, their invocation in magical contexts was often viewed with suspicion by religious authorities. Nevertheless, angelic magic remained a popular practice among ordinary people, who sought the help of angels in their daily lives.

#### <strong>Conclusion</strong>
This chapter provides a detailed examination of the role of angels in the magical practices of Late Antiquity, focusing on both Jewish and Christian traditions. Bohak&#x27;s analysis reveals the central place of angels in magical rituals, where they were invoked as intermediaries between the human and divine realms. The chapter also highlights the syncretic nature of angelic magic, where elements from different religious traditions were blended into a cohesive system of supernatural invocation. 

Bohak&#x27;s work underscores the importance of understanding angelic magic as part of the broader religious and cultural landscape of Late Antiquity, where magic and religion were often closely intertwined. Would you like to continue with the next chapter or section of the text?</div>

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;Angels and Astrology in Jewish Magic&quot; by Reimund Leicht</strong> (pgs. 183–201)

This chapter delves into the connection between angels and astrological beliefs in Jewish magical traditions, particularly in Late Antiquity. Reimund Leicht explores how Jewish magical texts incorporated both angelic invocations and astrological calculations to influence earthly events and outcomes. The chapter is rich with discussions about the integration of celestial beings and cosmic forces in the formulation of spells and magical rituals.

#### <strong>Astrological Elements in Jewish Magic</strong>
Leicht begins by explaining how astrology became intertwined with Jewish magical practices, especially from the 2nd century CE onwards. He emphasizes that Jewish astrologers and magicians drew on both Babylonian and Greco-Roman astrological traditions to craft their spells. In these texts, astrological timing, zodiac signs, and planetary influences were often mentioned in conjunction with invocations of angels.

One notable astrological text discussed in this section is the *Treatise of Shem* (pg. 218), an astrological handbook from the Cairo Genizah. This text details how events within a twelve-year cycle were linked to the positions of celestial bodies. Each chapter begins by specifying the zodiac sign in which the New Year is &quot;born,&quot; determining the year’s events. This document shows the deep connection between astrology and Jewish magical traditions, as it demonstrates how the celestial realm, particularly the zodiac, was believed to influence human destiny.

#### <strong>Astrological Figures and Angels</strong>
Leicht goes on to discuss the merging of astrology with angelic figures in Jewish magic. In particular, the astrological calendar was often interpreted as being under the control of specific angels. These angels were invoked in rituals designed to alter the influence of celestial forces on earthly matters, such as health, prosperity, and protection from harm.

One significant aspect is the practice of invoking angels associated with the planets, such as the angel of Mars for strength or the angel of Venus for love. In these spells, the astrologically derived planetary powers were believed to enhance the angels&#x27; influence on the targeted outcomes. For example, planetary angels might be invoked to improve a person&#x27;s standing in the community or to ensure a favorable outcome in business ventures (pg. 201).

#### <strong>Jewish Incantation Bowls and Celestial Influences</strong>
Leicht also discusses the use of Jewish incantation bowls, a common magical tool in Late Antiquity. These bowls often contained inscriptions invoking angels for protection or healing, while also referencing celestial phenomena such as lunar phases or planetary movements. The incantation bowls reveal a strong belief that celestial forces, including the power of angels, could be harnessed to protect individuals from evil spirits or illnesses.

The combination of astrology and angelic invocation in these bowls highlights the integration of cosmic and divine forces in Jewish magical practices. For example, one bowl might invoke the angel Sagnasgi’el to combat an evil spirit, while simultaneously referencing the position of the moon to ensure the angel’s success (pgs. 183–184).

#### <strong>Angels as Intermediaries of Cosmic Power</strong>
Leicht emphasizes that in Jewish magic, angels were often seen as intermediaries who channeled cosmic and astrological powers into the human realm. They could be called upon to align planetary influences in the favor of the petitioner, whether for protection, healing, or success in personal endeavors. This belief in the mediating power of angels reflects a syncretic blend of Jewish religious thought with the astrological and magical traditions of neighboring cultures.

The essay concludes by affirming that the incorporation of astrological elements into Jewish magic did not signify a deviation from religious tradition. Instead, it represented a practical and spiritual attempt to engage with the cosmos through divine agents (angels), using astrological knowledge as a tool for navigating the complexities of human life.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;Understanding Ritual in Jewish Magic: Perspectives from the Genizah and Related Sources&quot; by Michael D. Swartz</strong> (pgs. 233–254)

In this chapter, Michael D. Swartz explores the ritualistic aspects of Jewish magic, with a particular focus on texts and materials found in the Cairo Genizah. Swartz begins by discussing the importance of rituals in magical practices, emphasizing how these actions were often seen as necessary steps to manipulate divine or supernatural forces for practical ends. He notes that ritual actions in magic were often imbued with symbolism that connected the practitioner to the divine realm.

#### <strong>The Cairo Genizah as a Source for Jewish Magical Rituals</strong>
The Cairo Genizah, a rich repository of Jewish manuscripts, has yielded a large number of magical texts that provide insight into the ritual practices of Jewish communities in the medieval period. Swartz highlights that these texts contain spells, invocations, and rituals designed to heal, protect, or bring about desired outcomes. These rituals often involved invoking angels or the names of God, and they frequently included instructions for the use of amulets, incantation bowls, or other ritual objects.

A significant part of the chapter is dedicated to describing specific rituals preserved in the Genizah documents. For example, certain texts provide detailed instructions on how to perform healing rituals, using a combination of spoken words, gestures, and the placement of amulets or other objects. Swartz argues that these texts reflect a deep belief in the power of words and ritual actions to influence both the spiritual and material worlds.

#### <strong>The Structure of Magical Rituals</strong>
Swartz delves into the structure of Jewish magical rituals, noting that many of them followed a similar pattern. The practitioner would begin by purifying themselves and the space around them, often through the recitation of psalms or other prayers. This was followed by an invocation of divine or angelic forces, using specific names of God or angels believed to hold power over the forces of nature.

One of the texts Swartz discusses is a ritual that calls upon the angel Metatron to intervene in a legal dispute, showing how ritual and magic were intertwined with everyday concerns such as justice and social standing. The petitioner is instructed to fast and pray, after which they must recite a specific incantation invoking Metatron’s authority and power to sway the outcome of the trial (pgs. 244-246).

#### <strong>Use of Incantation Bowls and Amulets</strong>
Incantation bowls and amulets play a prominent role in the rituals described in Genizah texts. Swartz notes that these objects were often inscribed with protective texts and names of divine beings. The practitioner would place these bowls or amulets in specific locations, such as the entrance to a home or beneath the bed of a sick person, to ward off evil spirits or to invoke divine protection.

Swartz provides an example of a Jewish incantation bowl inscribed with angelic names and verses from the Torah, designed to protect the owner from harmful spirits. The bowl’s inscription not only invokes divine assistance but also includes instructions for how to properly position the bowl to ensure its effectiveness. This reflects a belief that both the text and the physical placement of the object were essential components of the ritual’s power (pg. 241).

#### <strong>The Role of Psalms and Scriptural Texts in Rituals</strong>
Jewish magical rituals frequently incorporated scriptural texts, especially psalms, which were believed to have inherent power when spoken aloud in a ritual context. Swartz discusses how certain psalms were considered particularly potent for specific purposes, such as healing, protection from enemies, or success in business.

He examines one text from the Genizah that provides a list of psalms to be recited during different phases of a magical ritual. For example, Psalm 91, which speaks of divine protection, was often used in rituals designed to ward off evil spirits or demonic forces. The practitioner would recite the psalm while holding a protective amulet, reinforcing the connection between spoken words and physical objects in the ritual process (pg. 239).

#### <strong>Syncretism and the Influence of Other Traditions</strong>
Swartz also touches upon the syncretic nature of Jewish magical practices, noting that many of the rituals and spells found in the Genizah were influenced by the surrounding cultures. This includes Greco-Roman and Babylonian traditions, where similar rituals involving the invocation of gods, angels, or other supernatural beings were common. Swartz argues that Jewish magical practices did not exist in isolation but were part of a broader cultural and religious milieu in which magical practices were shared and adapted across different traditions.

For example, certain spells found in the Genizah have parallels in ancient Greek magical papyri, particularly those that involve the invocation of celestial beings for protection or guidance. Swartz suggests that Jewish magicians may have drawn on these traditions, adapting them to fit within a Jewish theological framework (pgs. 251-253).

#### <strong>Conclusion</strong>
In his conclusion, Swartz emphasizes the importance of understanding Jewish magic as a legitimate form of religious practice rather than as a marginal or deviant activity. He argues that the rituals described in the Genizah texts reflect a complex interaction between religion, magic, and everyday life, where individuals sought divine assistance through both prayer and magical means. The texts provide valuable insight into the beliefs and practices of Jewish communities in the medieval period, showing how magic was used not only for spiritual purposes but also to address practical concerns such as health, protection, and justice.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>In the chapter <strong>&quot;Understanding Ritual in Jewish Magic: Perspectives from the Genizah and Related Sources&quot; by Michael D. Swartz</strong>, parallels are drawn between the Jewish magical texts found in the Cairo Genizah and the <strong>Greek Magical Papyri</strong> (PGM), emphasizing the syncretic nature of magical practices in Late Antiquity. These texts demonstrate how Jewish magicians adapted elements from Greco-Roman traditions while maintaining a distinctly Jewish framework for their rituals and invocations.

### <strong>Key Parallels between Jewish Magic and the Greek Magical Papyri:</strong>

1. <strong>Invocation of Celestial Beings</strong>:
   Both Jewish magic and the Greek Magical Papyri frequently involve the invocation of celestial beings, such as angels in Jewish texts or gods and daimones (supernatural entities) in Greek magical practices. In the PGM, deities like Hermes, Hecate, and Seth-Typhon are invoked for protection, healing, or success, much like Jewish texts call upon angels like Michael or Metatron. Both traditions share the belief that these supernatural beings can intervene in human affairs when properly invoked through specific rituals.

2. <strong>Use of Divine Names</strong>:
   In both Jewish and Greco-Roman magic, the use of divine names is a central feature of spells. The Greek Magical Papyri contain extensive lists of divine epithets and secret names, often combining names from different pantheons (e.g., the use of Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish divine names in the same spell). Similarly, Jewish magical texts make extensive use of the names of God (e.g., YHWH, Elohim) and angels, with the belief that the recitation of these names has inherent power to affect the outcome of the ritual.

3. <strong>Amulets and Inscribed Objects</strong>:
   Amulets and objects inscribed with magical texts are a common feature in both traditions. In the <strong>Greek Magical Papyri</strong>, amulets inscribed with magical formulas, divine names, and symbols were worn or placed in homes to provide protection against evil forces. Jewish incantation bowls and amulets often contained similar inscriptions, invoking angels or divine protection against harmful spirits or illnesses. Both cultures shared the belief that the physical presence of these inscribed objects, combined with the spoken word, was a critical aspect of the magical ritual.

4. <strong>Ritual Structure</strong>:
   The structure of many Jewish magical rituals found in the Genizah texts bears a striking resemblance to rituals in the Greek Magical Papyri. Both traditions include detailed instructions for purification, the preparation of the ritual space, the use of specific gestures, and the recitation of invocations. For example, both traditions involve purification through water or fire before performing the ritual, indicating a shared understanding of the need to cleanse the practitioner before engaging with the divine or supernatural forces.

5. <strong>Astrological and Celestial Timing</strong>:
   Both Jewish and Greco-Roman magical traditions placed great emphasis on the timing of rituals, often aligning magical operations with astrological events such as lunar phases, planetary alignments, or specific zodiac signs. In the Greek Magical Papyri, this is evident in rituals that instruct the practitioner to perform certain actions only when a specific star or planet is in the correct position. Jewish magic also incorporated astrological calculations, as seen in texts where angels or celestial beings are invoked according to the position of stars and planets.

6. <strong>Protective and Healing Spells</strong>:
   Spells for protection, healing, and exorcism are common in both the Greek Magical Papyri and Jewish magical texts. In both traditions, these spells frequently involve the invocation of divine or supernatural beings to drive away evil spirits or to cure illnesses. For example, in the Greek Magical Papyri, there are numerous spells designed to exorcise demons or heal physical ailments through the use of divine names and incantations. Similarly, Jewish magical texts from the Genizah often invoke angels or the divine name of God for protection against demons or to heal the sick.

### <strong>Example of Syncretism in Practice</strong>:
   One specific example discussed by Swartz is a spell from the Greek Magical Papyri (PGM IV. 475–829), which invokes a blend of deities from the Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish pantheons. In this spell, the practitioner calls upon deities such as Helios, Iao (a Greek form of Yahweh), and Seth-Typhon, demonstrating the blending of religious traditions in magical practice. Jewish magic also exhibits this kind of syncretism, where divine names from different cultures are merged into a single ritual framework, reflecting the cultural exchange between Jewish and Greco-Roman magicians during this period (pg. 251).

### <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
   The parallels between Jewish magical practices and the Greek Magical Papyri illustrate how magical traditions were shared, adapted, and transformed across cultural and religious boundaries. While each tradition retained its distinct religious identity, they both participated in a broader magical culture where practitioners exchanged ideas and techniques. This syncretism enriched both traditions, allowing for a diverse and dynamic approach to magic that incorporated elements from different religious systems, including Jewish, Greco-Roman, and Egyptian practices.

In this chapter, Giuseppe Veltri explores a fascinating collection of magical recipes found at the end of the Massekhet Berakhot in the manuscript Munich Hebr. 95. The recipes, many of which deal with water and the creation of living beings, are described as having significant implications for understanding medieval Jewish magic. Veltri situates these texts within the broader history of Jewish magical practices, providing both historical context and textual analysis of the rituals recorded.

#### <strong>The Manuscript and Its Significance</strong>
The manuscript Munich Hebr. 95 is an important source for studying medieval Jewish magic. Veltri explains that these magical texts were appended to a larger religious tractate, suggesting that the boundaries between formal religious rituals and magical practices were fluid in medieval Judaism. The manuscript&#x27;s magical recipes, especially those involving water, are of particular interest because they align with broader trends in both Jewish and non-Jewish magical traditions of the time.

#### <strong>Water and Creation</strong>
Many of the magical recipes focus on the manipulation of water to create life or affect the natural world. Veltri notes that water has long been associated with life and creation in magical and religious traditions. In these recipes, water is often imbued with supernatural properties, transforming it into a medium through which magical power can be exerted. Some of the recipes describe rituals for creating homunculi—small, artificial beings—by using water as a central element. These recipes often involve the invocation of divine names and the use of specific magical tools or substances.

#### <strong>The Reception of Magic in Jewish Intellectual Circles</strong>
Veltri discusses how magic, though often viewed negatively by religious authorities, persisted as a practice among certain Jewish communities. He explains that magic was sometimes seen as a complement to religious rituals, rather than a deviation from them. The inclusion of magical texts within a religious manuscript like Munich Hebr. 95 highlights the complexities of Jewish attitudes toward magic. Scholars such as Heinrich Graetz and Moritz Steinschneider, who cataloged and analyzed such manuscripts, generally viewed magic with skepticism, but their work remains essential for modern studies of Jewish magic.

#### <strong>The Role of Watermarks</strong>
One of the more technical aspects of Veltri’s chapter involves the study of watermarks found in the manuscript. These watermarks provide important clues about the manuscript’s origins, including its place and date of production. Veltri argues that by examining these physical elements, historians can better understand the circulation of magical texts in the medieval Jewish world. The presence of specific watermarks in the manuscript also suggests connections between Jewish magical practices and broader European magical traditions, particularly those involving water and creation rituals.

#### <strong>Conclusion: Magic as a Cultural and Religious Phenomenon</strong>
Veltri concludes the chapter by emphasizing the importance of understanding Jewish magic as both a cultural and religious phenomenon. He argues that the magical recipes in Munich Hebr. 95 reflect a complex interplay between religious belief, scientific curiosity, and cultural exchange. These magical texts were not merely superstitious remnants of a bygone era; they were part of a living tradition that continued to evolve and influence Jewish thought and practice throughout the medieval period.

The chapter provides a detailed examination of the intersection between magic, religion, and culture, using the manuscript Munich Hebr. 95 as a key case study. Veltri’s analysis sheds light on how medieval Jews understood and practiced magic, particularly in relation to creation and water-based rituals.

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### <strong>&quot;The Unwritten Chapter: Notes Towards a Social and Religious History of Geniza Magic&quot; by Steven Wasserstrom</strong> (pgs. 269–294)

In this chapter, Steven Wasserstrom embarks on a detailed exploration of the role of magic in the Geniza period, using the famous Cairo Geniza documents as a foundation. He aims to fill in the gaps in our understanding of Jewish magic during this time, particularly in relation to its social and religious functions. Wasserstrom places magic within a broader context of Jewish culture and daily life, suggesting that magic was not a marginal activity but an integral part of the religious and social fabric of Geniza society.

#### <strong>Magic in Everyday Life</strong>
Wasserstrom begins by highlighting the prevalence of magical practices among Jewish communities in the medieval Islamic world, as evidenced by the Geniza fragments. He asserts that magic was deeply embedded in the everyday life of Jews, reflecting concerns ranging from health and protection to legal disputes and social standing. The Geniza documents reveal that magical texts and practices were widespread, with amulets, incantation bowls, and magical prayers being common tools used by individuals to address practical concerns in their lives (pg. 271).

The chapter discusses various types of magic found in the Geniza, including protective magic (often used to ward off evil spirits), healing magic, and love magic. For instance, Wasserstrom points to several texts that detail the creation of amulets intended to protect individuals from disease or misfortune, demonstrating the everyday reliance on magical solutions in the absence of other medical or protective means.

#### <strong>The Intersection of Magic and Religion</strong>
Wasserstrom argues that magic and religion were not seen as mutually exclusive by medieval Jews. Rather, magical practices were often intertwined with religious rituals and beliefs. This is evidenced by the fact that many magical texts from the Geniza include references to God, angels, and biblical verses, suggesting that magic was viewed as a way of accessing divine power for practical purposes. The use of sacred names in spells, such as the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), further illustrates the connection between magic and religion (pg. 275).

The chapter delves into the role of religious authorities in regulating or endorsing magical practices. While some rabbinical authorities condemned certain types of magic, others seemed to accept or even promote magical practices that aligned with religious principles. This ambivalence toward magic reflects the complexity of its role within Jewish religious life during the Geniza period.

#### <strong>The Cairo Geniza as a Source of Magical Knowledge</strong>
The Cairo Geniza, a treasure trove of medieval Jewish manuscripts, offers invaluable insights into the magical practices of Jewish communities. Wasserstrom emphasizes that many of the magical texts found in the Geniza are unique, providing details about specific spells, rituals, and incantations that were used by Jews in the Islamic world. He highlights the diversity of magical traditions preserved in the Geniza, which include influences from Babylonian, Greco-Roman, and Islamic magical traditions (pg. 279).

One particularly interesting aspect of the Geniza’s magical texts is the use of the Hebrew language alongside Aramaic and Arabic, reflecting the multilingual nature of the Jewish communities in this period. These texts also include magical recipes and instructions for creating amulets, invoking angels, and performing divination. The inclusion of magical texts in the Geniza documents suggests that magic was not only practiced by isolated individuals but was part of a broader communal tradition.

#### <strong>The Social Function of Magic</strong>
Wasserstrom explores the social dimensions of magic, suggesting that it served as a tool for negotiating power and social relationships within the Jewish community. For example, magic was often used to influence legal decisions or to gain favor with powerful individuals. Some texts detail spells intended to sway the outcome of court cases or to gain an advantage in business transactions. This indicates that magic was not merely a form of personal spiritual practice but was also a means of navigating the social and economic structures of the time (pg. 283).

The chapter also touches upon the role of women in magical practices, noting that many of the magical texts from the Geniza are addressed to or created by women. This suggests that women played an active role in the production and use of magic, particularly in the domestic sphere. Women’s involvement in magic highlights the gendered nature of certain magical practices, such as fertility spells and protective amulets for children.

#### <strong>Conclusion: Magic as a Reflection of Social and Religious Life</strong>
In his conclusion, Wasserstrom argues that magic provides a unique window into the social and religious life of medieval Jewish communities. The magical texts of the Geniza reflect the concerns, beliefs, and practices of ordinary Jews, showing that magic was an integral part of their daily lives. Rather than being seen as a fringe or illicit activity, magic was woven into the fabric of Jewish society, functioning alongside religious rituals and social structures.

Wasserstrom concludes by calling for further study of the Geniza’s magical texts, suggesting that they offer valuable insights into the intersection of religion, society, and magic in the medieval Jewish world.
