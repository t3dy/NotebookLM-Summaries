| <strong>Magic as an Object of Study</strong>      | Examines the European fascination with Egypt, the historical collection of papyri, and Frazer’s theory of magic as a precursor to religion and science.       | Highlights the development of anthropology&#x27;s focus on magic as a structured phenomenon distinct from religion and science.                                                              | Critiques Frazer’s unilinear evolution of thought, emphasizing diverse cultural practices and challenges posed by ethnocentric and dualistic frameworks.                                                                      | Magic is a pervasive human phenomenon, evolving alongside society, yet distinct from science and religion in its objectives and methodology.                                | “Magic is a primitive stage of the human mind…on their way to Religion and, finally, to Science.”                                                                 | Frazer, Malinowski, Lévy-Strauss, Durkheim, Tambiah, et al.                                                                                                                            |
| <strong>Evidence About Magic in Greece</strong>   | Explores Greek curse tablets and literature to reveal practices and beliefs in ancient Greece, focusing on personal rituals and subversive uses of magic.     | Establishes magic as a marginal, individual activity that parasitically utilizes official religion.                                                                                      | Notes how literary evidence often distorts the reality of magic, emphasizing narrative enhancement over historical accuracy.                                                                                                   | Magic sought personal mastery over nature and people, in contrast to religion’s collective submission to divine will.                                                    | “Religion believes that these superior beings dominate the course of Nature… while for Magic… Nature is governed by rigid and impersonal laws.”                      | Curse tablets (defixiones), Homeric epics, and works by historians like Evans-Pritchard and anthropologists like Mauss and Malinowski.                                                       |
| <strong>Magic in the Hellenistic Period</strong>  | Describes the integration of Greek and Eastern ideas, the syncretism of gods, and the dominance of magic in late antiquity, notably through the Magical Papyri.| Illustrates the transition from classical rationalism to a syncretic magical worldview that dominated late antiquity.                                                                   | Challenges the narrative of linear progression from magic to science by showing the resurgence of magic in later Greco-Roman culture.                                                                                          | Hellenistic syncretism elevated magical practices, blending Greek and Eastern traditions in a unique cultural and religious amalgamation.                                     | “Religion never rid itself of Magic, [and] the latter underwent an unexpected increase…disastrous for the scientific and philosophical culture of classical Greece.” | Hellenistic Greek and Roman syncretism; Papyri Graecae Magicae; works by Preisendanz and modern translations like Betz and Calvo Martínez.                                          |
| <strong>Greek Magical Papyri</strong>             | Discusses the contents and significance of the Papyri Graecae Magicae, detailing practices like invocations, spells, and complex rituals for divine aid.     | Provides a comprehensive view of Greco-Roman magical practices, their relation to religion, and their philosophical reinterpretation in late antiquity.                                 | Reveals how magical texts complicate distinctions between religion and magic, blending ritual, science, and belief systems into a multifaceted tradition.                                                                      | Magical papyri embody a structured system of thought integrating elements of animism, ritual, and philosophy, transcending simplistic definitions of magic.                 | “Magic of the traditional type takes over Religion and becomes a new reality that participates in both…rituals and incantations.”                                            | Papyri Graecae Magicae (Berlin, Louvre, British Museum collections); translations by Betz, Calvo Martínez, and Maltomini.                                                                |
| <strong>Magic and Religious Distinctions</strong> | Evaluates how magic contrasts with religion, emphasizing coercion in magic versus submission in religion, and their shared cultural underpinnings.            | Clarifies the nuanced interplay between religion and magic, highlighting their mutual influences and distinct goals.                                                                     | Explores how modern interpretations struggle with the overlapping domains of magic, religion, and science, often oversimplifying these interactions.                                                                           | Magic’s core is coercion and mastery, while religion’s essence lies in devotion and supplication, making them fundamentally different despite shared elements.              | “The magician&#x27;s attitude…is coercive and imperative: the priest pleads, the magician commands: ‘Do this soon, soon, now, now.’”                                           | Key texts include Frazer’s theories, anthropological studies by Hubert and Mauss, and ritualistic evidence in the Magical Papyri.                                                  |

### <strong>Key Features and Interactions:</strong>
1. <strong>Dual Functions:</strong>  
   - <strong>Chthonic Deities</strong> are associated with death, the underworld, and coercion, representing the darker, binding forces of magic.  
   - <strong>Astral Deities</strong> symbolize cosmic order, divine knowledge, and enlightenment, reflecting an aspirational aspect of magical practice.
   
2. <strong>Syncretic Integration:</strong>  
   - Many deities acquired overlapping attributes due to the Hellenistic fusion of cultures (e.g., Helios as Apollo, Amun Ra, and Yahweh).  
   - Chthonic rituals often paralleled astral invocations, indicating a holistic view of divine and supernatural forces.

3. <strong>Symbolism:</strong>  
   - Chthonic rituals use graves, underworld deities, and binding actions to tie down adversaries.  
   - Astral rituals incorporate celestial movements, planetary associations, and light symbolism to draw power or insight.
