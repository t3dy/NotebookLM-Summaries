| Abstract                   | Overview of medieval ritual magic texts: image magic, necromancy, theurgy. Discusses scholarly developments since 1990s.                                               | Emphasizes diversity and increasing recognition of ritual magic as an intellectual pursuit.                                         | Expands focus beyond condemnation, showing complexity and integration into scholarly discourse.                      | Ritual magic in the Middle Ages was more diverse and scholarly than previously acknowledged.                 | &quot;A number of interesting new discoveries, both textual and historical, have been made since the 1990s...&quot;       | Foundational: Thorndike&#x27;s *History of Magic and Experimental Science*; Contributions: Frances Yates’ work.                                            |
| Introduction               | Defines categories of magic (image magic, necromancy, theurgy). Highlights medieval literati as key practitioners of ritual magic.                                     | Explores overlap between learned magic and religious/intellectual traditions.                                                       | Reveals ambiguity in the sources, blurring lines between magic and orthodoxy.                                       | Medieval ritual magic reflects intellectual curiosity intertwined with religious practices.                   | &quot;Magic has a slippery way of escaping disciplinary structures as well.&quot;                                          | Arabic sources on astrological image magic; Michael Scot, Roger Bacon, Arnold of Villanova cited.                                                     |
| Developments 1970-1989     | Highlights foundational works linking medieval magic with the evolution of early modern witchcraft.                                                                   | Connects ritual magic to broader socio-legal contexts, e.g., witch trials.                                                          | Earlier works suffered from lack of critical editions of primary texts.                                             | Medieval ritual magic laid groundwork for later concepts of witchcraft.                                       | &quot;New attention was thus brought to the idea of the ‘magician’ as potentially under-acknowledged...&quot;            | Norman Cohn, Richard Kieckhefer, and Edward Peters; Key texts include *Picatrix* (David Pingree&#x27;s edition).                                            |
| Developments 1990-2013     | Focus on critical editions of primary texts and interdisciplinary approaches linking magic, science, and theology.                                                    | Advances understanding through critical editions, e.g., *Ars Notoria*, and manuscripts like John of Morigny’s *Flowers of Heavenly Teaching*. | Questions the marginalization of magic by redefining its place in medieval intellectual history.                     | Ritual magic was integral to medieval knowledge systems, not peripheral.                                      | &quot;Editing of original texts is, of course, crucially important to this project.&quot;                                | Jean-Patrice Boudet’s *Entre Science et Nigromance*, Benedek Láng’s *Unlocked Books*, Frank Klaassen’s works.                                            |
| Conclusion                 | Outlines future research directions in manuscript studies and critical theory of magic. Suggests integration with esotericism studies.                                 | Advocates for placing medieval ritual magic within broader epistemological frameworks.                                              | Many texts remain unedited; field is evolving but not fully mapped.                                                 | Medieval ritual magic requires recontextualization within scholarly narratives of knowledge and belief.       | &quot;Much of the field still depends on work not yet in print.&quot;                                                     | Wouter Hanegraaff’s *Esotericism and the Academy*; Stuart McWilliams’ *Magical Thinking*.                                                                |

| <strong>Image Magic</strong>| Magic using astrological and stellar correspondences to create talismans and images.                  | Harnessing natural powers of stars or invoking spirits for effects.                                 | Blends Arabic astrological texts with Latin traditions; overlaps with theurgy and necromancy through invocation of entities or focus on natural celestial influences.            | Difficult to distinguish between natural and supernatural effects; criticized for blending science and superstition.                                     |
