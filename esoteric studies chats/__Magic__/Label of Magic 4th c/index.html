| Introduction               | Discusses the use of the term &quot;magic&quot; in fourth-century religious and political disputes, citing an unnamed Roman senator accused of practicing magic.                                                                          | Introduces &quot;magic&quot; as a discursive category, highlighting its fluid and subjective application in historical contexts.                                                                                                              | Questions the conventional distinction between &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;religion,&quot; proposing that the term reflects societal power dynamics.       | Magic is a socially constructed label applied to delegitimize rival groups, reflecting cultural prejudices and political rivalries.                                               | &quot;Magic becomes real in the sense that belief in its existence is real and influences human decisions and actions.&quot; - Kahlos                                                      | Cod. Par. Lat. 8084; Cameron, *The Last Pagans*; Drake, &quot;Afterword&quot;; Stratton, *Naming the Witch*.                                                                                                                        |
| Defining Magic             | Explores definitions, noting the term&#x27;s use as a heuristic tool and the risk of subjective distinctions between religion and magic.                                                                                             | Highlights the evolution of scholarly thought challenging rigid distinctions between religion and magic, emphasizing the term&#x27;s use in polemical contexts.                                                                        | Critiques the lack of an objective basis for differentiating magic from religion, advocating for a nuanced understanding.               | Magic is best understood as a label constructed in specific social and historical contexts rather than an intrinsic phenomenon.                                                    | &quot;Where religion ends and magic begins...depends upon the stance of the person speaking or writing.&quot; - Remus, &quot;Method, Madness.&quot;                                                  | Phillips, “Nullum Crimen”; Meyer and Smith, “Introduction”; Versnel, &quot;Some Reflections&quot;; Gordon, “Introduction.”                                                                                                         |
| Pagan Practices            | Examines how Christian writers like Augustine equated pagan religious practices with magic, framing them as demonic and deceitful.                                                                                             | Connects the Christian critique of pagan practices to broader polemical traditions, influencing perceptions of magic in antiquity.                                                                                                | Shows how accusations of magic served to marginalize and criminalize Greco-Roman religious practices, reinforcing Christian hegemony.  | The label of magic was used to alienate and delegitimize pagan practices, linking them to demonic deceit.                                                                          | &quot;Even as late as the fourth and early fifth centuries, Christian authors...were forced to defend Jesus from the charge of being a magician.&quot;                                       | Augustine, *Civitas Dei*; Eusebius, *Demonstratio Evangelica*; Prud., *Contra Symmachum*.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Heresies                   | Discusses the use of magic accusations in ecclesiastical disputes, such as against Priscillian and Eunomians, to discredit heretical movements.                                                                               | Demonstrates the role of magic accusations in consolidating ecclesiastical authority and suppressing doctrinal dissent.                                                                                                           | Reveals the integration of heresy and magic charges as a tool for controlling theological and political challenges.                     | Magic served as a potent charge to frame theological opponents as subversive or demonic, legitimizing harsh penalties.                                                            | &quot;The writings of Eunomians were compared with magical books...for which the death penalty was decreed.&quot;                                                                          | Council of Saragossa, 380; Codex Theodosianus (CTh); Sulpicius Severus, *Chronicon*.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Political Adversaries      | Explores cases where accusations of magic targeted political figures, such as Sopater and Athanasius, often leading to trials or executions.                                                                                   | Illustrates how magic was wielded as a political weapon to eliminate threats and consolidate imperial authority.                                                                                                                   | Identifies the role of magic trials in reflecting rulers&#x27; anxieties about knowledge and power.                                         | Magic accusations highlight the nexus of political, religious, and personal rivalries in late antiquity.                                                                          | &quot;These trials reveal an increasing unease of the rulers...to control sources of knowledge and eliminate political rivals.&quot; - Kahlos                                              | Ammianus Marcellinus; Constantine&#x27;s trials; Lenski, *Failure of Empire*.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Legislation                | Reviews late antique laws targeting magic (e.g., maleficium) and how ambiguous terms like *superstitio* were used against various practices.                                                                                   | Explains how imperial legislation both reflected and shaped societal fears of magic, integrating religious and political governance.                                                                                               | Critiques the ambiguity of legal definitions, which enabled broad applications and potential misuse.                                  | Magic laws reveal efforts to enforce religious orthodoxy and control private rituals, reflecting broader shifts in imperial policy.                                                | &quot;Maleficium was classified as the third gravest crime after high treason and murder.&quot;                                                                                            | Codex Theodosianus; Senatus Consultum (17 CE); Graf, “Augustine and Magic”; Fögen, *Die Enteignung der Wahrsager*.                                                                                                      |
| Concluding Remarks         | Summarizes the strategic use of magic accusations as a discourse in late antiquity to marginalize rivals and solidify power.                                                                                                   | Proposes that magic accusations were integral to societal power structures and polemical strategies in late antiquity.                                                                                                             | Challenges the perception of magic as a distinct, isolated phenomenon, instead situating it within socio-political contexts.            | Magic is both a belief influencing decisions and a rhetorical tool used in contests for authority.                                                                                | &quot;Magic as such does not exist but becomes real in the sense that belief in its existence is real and affects human decisions and actions.&quot; - Kahlos                               | Stratton, *Naming the Witch*; Brown, &quot;Sorcery, Demons and the Rise of Christianity&quot;; Mauss, *A General Theory of Magic*.                                                                                                                                       |

| Karen B. Stratton    | Explored magic as a discursive construct in her work *Naming the Witch*.                                  | Magic as a socially constructed label shaped by external perceptions.                             | Magic becomes real in its societal consequences, even if it lacks intrinsic existence.                          | Critiques essentialist views of magic and emphasizes the subjectivity of its definitions.                   | Provides a framework for understanding magic as a rhetorical and social phenomenon rather than a fixed entity.              |
| Augustine of Hippo   | Fourth-century Christian thinker; writings like *Civitas Dei* linked paganism with demonic deception.     | Differentiated divine miracles from demonic magic.                                                | Framed magic as a means to discredit pagan and heretical practices, solidifying Christian orthodoxy.            | His views reflect Christian polemics rather than neutral observations, embedding cultural prejudices.        | Central to the argument about how magic was weaponized in religious and political discourse in late antiquity.             |
| Mauss, Marcel        | Early 20th-century sociologist; *A General Theory of Magic*.                                              | Magic as a social phenomenon driven by collective belief.                                         | Magic exists insofar as societal belief creates tangible effects on actions and institutions.                   | Struggles to separate magic from religion in historical contexts.                                             | Foundations for understanding magic as a collective and constructed phenomenon.                                             |
| Peter Brown          | Historian of late antiquity; examined magic within broader social and religious conflicts.                | Magic accusations arise from group conflicts in societal “buffer zones.”                          | Magic reflects societal anxieties and power struggles rather than actual unsanctioned practices.               | Challenges overgeneralized interpretations of magic trials as indicative of widespread practices.            | Adds depth to the understanding of magic as reflecting power dynamics rather than literal practices.                       |

<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### Unlocking the Power of Labels: Contributions to the Study of Magic in Late Antiquity  

The study of magic has long been a window into understanding societal fears, religious rivalries, and political power. Maijastina Kahlos’ article, *Artis Heu Magicis: The Label of Magic in Fourth-Century Conflicts and Disputes,* offers a profound exploration of how accusations of magic functioned as a social, legal, and rhetorical tool in late antiquity. This blog post delves into the key contributions of this paper, highlighting how it reshapes our understanding of magic as more than superstition—it was a weapon, a label, and a reflection of power dynamics.

### 1. <strong>Magic as a Social Construct</strong>  
Kahlos positions magic not as a set of practices but as a label strategically applied to delegitimize opponents. Whether targeting pagan rituals, heretical Christian sects, or political rivals, the term &quot;magic&quot; was a malleable category, shaped by societal fears and cultural prejudices.  

For example, Augustine of Hippo reframed traditional Roman religious practices as demonic magic, branding figures like Numa Pompilius, the founder of Roman civic religion, as magicians in league with evil forces. This reveals how magic accusations weren’t about defining practices but about asserting moral and theological dominance.  

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Magic accusations are less about the accused and more about the accuser’s agenda. They reveal societal boundaries, anxieties, and power struggles.  

---

### 2. <strong>The Fluid Boundary Between Religion and Magic</strong>  
One of the paper&#x27;s most significant contributions is its critique of the conventional distinction between religion and magic. Scholars like H.S. Versnel and Peter Brown, cited in the work, argue that these terms exist on a continuum rather than as binary opposites. Practices deemed “magic” often reflected unsanctioned or private religious behavior that clashed with dominant norms.  

For instance, theurgy—rituals aimed at divine communion—was praised by Neoplatonic philosophers but condemned as demonic magic by Christian polemicists. This fluidity underscores the subjective nature of these categories.  

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> What is labeled as magic often depends on who holds power and whose practices deviate from sanctioned norms.

### 3. <strong>Magic as a Tool of Social Control</strong>  
Kahlos highlights how magic accusations were weaponized to consolidate imperial and ecclesiastical power. Imperial legislation, such as the Codex Theodosianus, equated heretical writings with magical books, imposing severe penalties. These laws provided a legal framework for suppressing dissent, both religious and political.  

Notable cases include:  
- <strong>Priscillian’s trial:</strong> A bishop accused of heresy and magic, reflecting the overlap of theological and political struggles.  
- <strong>Sopater’s execution:</strong> A philosopher accused of using magic to disrupt grain supplies, exposing the economic underpinnings of some magic accusations.  

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Magic accusations were often less about belief in sorcery and more about controlling knowledge, quelling dissent, and asserting dominance.  

---

### 4. <strong>Christian Apologetics and the Defense Against Magic</strong>  
Early Christians, often accused of magic themselves, had to redefine the term to distinguish their miracles from pagan practices. Writers like Augustine and Eusebius argued that Christian miracles were divine acts, while pagan rituals were demonic deceptions.  

This rhetorical strategy not only defended Christianity but also reframed its theological rivals as practitioners of sinister magic. By the fourth century, this redefinition of magic was central to Christian apologetics, enabling the religion to claim moral and spiritual authority over Greco-Roman traditions.  

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> The evolution of the concept of magic reflects Christianity’s rise to dominance and its struggle to define itself against paganism and heresy.

### 5. <strong>A Broader Perspective on Magic</strong>  
The paper integrates insights from anthropology, sociology, and legal studies to deepen our understanding of magic. Drawing from scholars like Marcel Mauss, who viewed magic as a social phenomenon, Kahlos demonstrates how belief in magic—whether or not it existed—shaped human behavior and decisions.  

Moreover, the paper sheds light on how magic trials and laws mirrored societal anxieties about secrecy, deviance, and knowledge control. From nocturnal rituals to divination, practices labeled as magic often reflected the fears of a changing world where old systems of power were being challenged.  

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Magic trials and laws reveal not just fears of the supernatural but broader societal transformations and insecurities.

### Conclusion: Magic as a Mirror of Society  
Kahlos’ study reminds us that magic is as much about perception as practice. It is a tool that reflects societal anxieties, a rhetorical weapon in disputes, and a means of asserting control over knowledge and belief. By framing magic as a label rather than an intrinsic category, the paper challenges us to rethink its role in shaping history and culture.  

The study of magic in late antiquity thus opens a window into how societies construct &quot;the other&quot; and wield power, a lesson as relevant today as it was centuries ago.
