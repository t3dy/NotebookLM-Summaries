### Exploring Medieval Magic: Contributions of Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic offers profound insights into the cultural, religious, and social dynamics of the period. Scholars like Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson have made significant contributions to this field, each bringing unique perspectives and expertise. This essay examines their contributions, focusing on Fanger&#x27;s exploration of magical practice and spiritual agency, Klaassen&#x27;s investigation into the interplay between magic and religion, and Peterson&#x27;s work on grimoires and magical texts.

<strong>Claire Fanger: Conjuring Spirits and Cultural Context</strong>

Claire Fanger’s work, particularly in *&quot;Conjuring Spirits: Divine Agency in Early Modern Europe&quot;* (2006), is pivotal for understanding the role of spirits in medieval magic. Fanger delves into how magical practices were not merely esoteric or occult but were deeply integrated into the everyday lives of people in early modern Europe. Her analysis reveals that magic was a means of engaging with divine and supernatural forces, reflecting broader cultural and religious concerns.

Fanger argues that magical rituals often invoked spirits to mediate between the practitioner and the divine. This perspective underscores the complexity of medieval magical practices, which were not isolated from mainstream religious thought but were part of a broader continuum of spiritual engagement. By focusing on how spirits were perceived and utilized in these practices, Fanger provides a nuanced understanding of the social and religious dimensions of magic.

<strong>Frank Klaassen: Magic, Religion, and Authority</strong>

Frank Klaassen’s *&quot;Magic in the Cloister: Piety, Conflict, and Struggle for Authority in Medieval Religion&quot;* (2013) offers an in-depth examination of how magic intersected with religious institutions and practices. Klaassen explores the ways in which magical practices were regulated and contested within monastic settings and broader religious contexts. His work highlights the tensions between magic and ecclesiastical authority, illustrating how magical practices were both a challenge to and a component of religious authority.

Klaassen&#x27;s analysis is particularly valuable for understanding the institutional responses to magic. Monastic communities, as Klaassen illustrates, were not only sites of piety but also of magical practice. The struggle for authority within these communities reveals much about the perceived threat of magic to religious and social order. By examining these interactions, Klaassen sheds light on the complexities of religious life and the negotiation of authority in medieval society.

<strong>Joseph Peterson: Grimoires and Magical Texts</strong>

Joseph Peterson’s contributions are crucial for the study of medieval grimoires and magical texts. His work, including *&quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;* (2001) and *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;* (2004), provides critical translations and analyses of key magical manuscripts. Peterson’s efforts have made these texts more accessible and have offered valuable insights into their contents and historical significance.

Peterson’s translations of grimoires such as the *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;* are particularly important for understanding the practical aspects of medieval magic. These texts, often filled with complex rituals and invocations, offer a window into the magical practices and beliefs of the time. Peterson’s meticulous work in translating and interpreting these texts has significantly advanced our understanding of medieval magical practices and their transmission across different periods and cultures.

<strong>Integrating the Contributions</strong>

Fanger, Klaassen, and Peterson’s works collectively offer a comprehensive view of medieval magic. Fanger’s focus on the role of spirits provides a cultural and spiritual context for understanding magical practices. Klaassen’s exploration of the relationship between magic and religion reveals the institutional and social dynamics that influenced magical practices. Peterson’s translations and analyses of grimoires offer direct insights into the texts and rituals used by medieval practitioners.

These scholars’ contributions highlight the multifaceted nature of medieval magic. Magic was not an isolated phenomenon but was deeply embedded in the social, religious, and cultural fabric of the time. By integrating Fanger’s, Klaassen’s, and Peterson’s work, we gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of how magic functioned and was perceived in medieval society.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The study of medieval magic, enriched by the contributions of Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson, provides valuable insights into the period’s cultural and religious dynamics. Fanger’s exploration of spiritual agency, Klaassen’s examination of magic’s interplay with religious authority, and Peterson’s work on grimoires collectively enhance our understanding of medieval magical practices. Their scholarly efforts continue to illuminate the complex and integral role of magic in medieval life, offering a deeper appreciation of its significance and impact.

Naked as they may be, abstracted from context and presented in the evident in-

questions central to this volume:

ings can know? 

2. How may human beings, unfit for direct knowledge of the divine, neverthe- 
less engage with divine things in order to be saved? 


There are other, more conventional responses to these questions in the later 
Middle Ages, but this volume is about some of the less conventional ones. The 
essays collected here look at a variety of alternative views of the relationship of 
human beings with the divine, as recorded in texts that engage traditional the- 
ologies and liturgies in unusual ways, sometimes weaving together sources from 
more than one religion and sometimes from sources commonly regarded as 
magical. Some of these texts were condemned by medieval and early modern 
theologians as being in the same class as demonic magic. Despite their status, 
then and now, outside the canon of medieval religious and devotional writings,

these texts offer important perspectives on the study of religion in the Middle 
Ages. In general, they attest to the plurality of visions of religious practice, not 
only in the later Middle Ages but into the sixteenth century. They also demon- 
strate that this plurality included fertile cross-cultural exchange. Their abun- 
dance in manuscript attests to an increasing interest in alternative forms of 
access to the divine, and perhaps also to a parallel anxiety that ordinary liturgies 
and sacraments might not be sufficient to procure salvation. Finally, these vari- 
ous approaches to the divine also bear upon natural philosophy, science, and 
rationality, demanding more nuanced approaches to the relationships between 
scientific practices and devotional ones. 

Until fairly recently, these works had remained almost untouched by histo- 
rians. Starting in the late 1980s, there began to be a marked increase in scholar- 
ship on medieval ritual magic texts and, relatedly, on the broader problem of 
magic. Over the past ten years, the trickle of new articles, books, and editions of 
these texts has increased to something that might almost be called a spate. In my 
1998 collection Conjuring Spirits, | complained that the area of texts and manu- 
scripts of medieval intellectual magic still had too little coverage beyond what 
was available in Lynn Thorndike’s History of Magic and Experimental Science, 
completed in 1958.” Now the area looks completely different. In fact, important 
new discoveries are coming so thick and fast that it is often difficult for publi- 
cation to keep up—getting a new discovery into print before it is outdated is a 
challenge that can be both exhilarating and frustrating for those involved.* 

For this book, I have solicited contributions from scholars whose work has 
made significant inroads into this former wilderness territory. Taken together, 
the essays collected here shed light on connections between the domains of 
religion and science as continuous aspects of habitus for writers and operators 
of these texts; they show how necessary it is to consider medieval and early 
modern epistemology as a whole, within the context of all the kinds of texts that 
concern it. 

In the history of ideas, the “magical” has often emerged as a label for an idea 
or approach that apparently should have been broken away from earlier—a 
problem of fossilized thinking.‘ Yet if modern science has tended to define itself 
by opposition to a magic that was in principle older, less knowing, and less pro- 
gressive, at the same time the process of “normal science” has always prag- 
matically adapted itself to the modes of thought, explanation, and experimental 
practice of the time. So also has normal magic, of course. In different ways the 
cosmic infusion of knowledge sought by the liturgy of the Ars notoria (discussed 
by Véronése), the spiritual cosmology detailed in Antonio da Montolmo’s De 
occultis et manifestis (discussed by Weill-Parot), and the spirit-conjuring diaries 
of Humphrey Gilbert (discussed by Klaassen) all show how medieval and early

modern intellectual writers might associate the angelic worlds and the worlds of 
human knowledge at once experimentally, scientifically, and spiritually. 
Another aspect of the premodern epistemology illuminated by these essays 
is the purposeful bricolage of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic ritual elements that 
appear in these texts. While the mutual influences of medieval Jewish, Chris- 
tian, and Islamic writers on philosophy and science have long been a subject of 
examination for intellectual historians, the interaction between these groups on 
typological, angelological, and liturgical levels has been much harder to study, 
in part because of restrictions imposed by disciplinary boundaries, but more 
significantly because the data for such interactions depend so strongly on texts 
that are examined here in depth, in some cases for the first time. Many essays in 
this volume are concerned with key points of this intercultural and interreligious 
conversation. Topics range from the Latin Liber Razielis and Liber de essentia 
spirituum, discussed by Sophie Page, to new findings on the probable relation- 
ship between Christian, Jewish, and Muslim influences on the Liber iuratus 
Honorii, by Jan Veenstra and Katelyn Mesler, to analyses of the way Jewish and 
Christian identities are formed through and against ideas about each other’s li- 
turgical practices, as shown in essays by myself, Harvey Hames, and Elliot Wolf- 
son. It is only by opening up the history of ideas, as well as the various histories 
of science and spirituality, to contemplation of texts of this kind that we can 
begin to form a truly historical picture of medieval and early modern life. 


L Texts and Contexts 


One goal of this book is to bring forward new research data for scholars who 
specialize in medieval manuscripts of magic; but it is also hoped that the book 
may provide some useful information to a broader audience of readers inter- 
ested in contiguous areas of medieval social, cultural, and religious history. Be- 
cause not all potential readers will be familiar with the texts under discussion in 
this volume, what follows is a brief conspectus, partly to give novice readers a 
thumbnail sketch of these relatively obscure texts, partly to indicate something 
of the way the historical narrative around them will be further changed by the 
essays in this book.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic is a rich and complex field, offering insights into the cultural, religious, and social dynamics of the period. Key scholars Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson have each made substantial contributions to this field. Their work provides a multifaceted view of magic in the medieval and early modern periods. This essay will examine their contributions, with a particular focus on Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement, Klaassen’s investigation into the interplay between magic and religious authority, and Peterson’s work on grimoires and magical texts.

<strong>Claire Fanger: Divine Manifestation and Spiritual Engagement</strong>

Claire Fanger’s contributions to the study of medieval magic are profoundly influential. In her seminal work, *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012), Fanger explores how magical texts and practices sought to bridge the gap between the divine and the mundane. She focuses on texts like the *Liber iuratus Honorii*, which proclaim the transformative power of magic in engaging with the divine. The final paragraph of the *Liber iuratus Honorii* emphasizes the book&#x27;s perceived divine value, claiming it as a means to see God face to face and to secure eternal salvation, contrasting it with other forms of religious practice (Fanger, 2012).

Fanger’s analysis highlights the persistence of two central questions in medieval magic: how the divine can manifest in the world and how humans, unfit for direct divine knowledge, can still engage with divine things for salvation (Fanger, 2012). This exploration shows that magical texts were not merely esoteric but were deeply intertwined with broader religious and philosophical questions of the time. Fanger’s work demonstrates that these texts often sought to combine traditional religious practices with alternative spiritual approaches, reflecting a rich tapestry of medieval spiritual and intellectual life.

Moreover, Fanger addresses the increasing scholarly interest in magical texts that had remained largely unexplored until the late 20th century. Her work acknowledges the challenges and excitement of engaging with new discoveries and interpretations in this evolving field (Fanger, 2012). Her focus on cross-cultural and interreligious influences, as well as the practical and ritual aspects of magic, underscores the complexity of medieval magical practices and their significance in the broader context of medieval religious thought.

<strong>Frank Klaassen: Magic and Religious Authority</strong>

Frank Klaassen’s research offers a critical perspective on the interaction between magic and religious institutions. In *&quot;Magic in the Cloister: Piety, Conflict, and Struggle for Authority in Medieval Religion&quot;* (2013), Klaassen explores how magical practices were both regulated and contested within monastic and broader religious contexts. His work reveals the tensions between magical practices and ecclesiastical authority, illustrating how magic was perceived as both a challenge to and a component of religious life.

Klaassen’s examination of monastic communities highlights that these institutions were not just centers of piety but also places where magic was practiced and debated. This interaction between magic and religious authority sheds light on the broader struggles for power and legitimacy within the medieval Church. By documenting these struggles, Klaassen provides a nuanced understanding of how magic was integrated into and contested by religious institutions, offering insights into the complexities of medieval spirituality and authority.

Additionally, Klaassen’s work situates magical practices within a broader context of religious and intellectual conflict. His analysis of magical practices in relation to religious authority demonstrates how these practices were not isolated but were part of ongoing debates about the nature of divinity and the proper means of engaging with the divine. This perspective is crucial for understanding the broader implications of magical practices for medieval religious and social structures.

<strong>Joseph Peterson: Grimoires and Magical Texts</strong>

Joseph Peterson’s contributions to the study of medieval grimoires and magical texts are instrumental. His translations and analyses of key magical manuscripts, such as the *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;* (2004) and the *&quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;* (2001), provide critical insights into the practical aspects of medieval magic. Peterson’s work makes these texts accessible to scholars and students, offering valuable information about their contents and historical significance.

Peterson’s translations of grimoires are particularly important for understanding the rituals and practices described in these texts. The *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;*, for example, provides detailed instructions for invoking divine knowledge and achieving spiritual enlightenment through specific rituals and prayers. Peterson’s work on this text reveals the complex interplay between ritual magic and intellectual pursuits in the medieval period (Peterson, 2004).

Furthermore, Peterson’s analysis of the *&quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;* offers insights into the broader tradition of magical practice and its evolution over time. By providing detailed translations and contextual analyses, Peterson helps scholars understand the historical development of magical practices and their significance within the medieval and early modern periods (Peterson, 2001).

<strong>Integrating the Contributions</strong>

The combined contributions of Fanger, Klaassen, and Peterson offer a comprehensive view of medieval magic. Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement reveals the deep connections between magical practices and broader religious questions. Klaassen’s investigation into the interaction between magic and religious authority sheds light on the complex dynamics of medieval religious life. Peterson’s work on grimoires and magical texts provides direct insights into the practices and beliefs of medieval practitioners.

These scholars’ contributions highlight the multifaceted nature of medieval magic. Magic was not an isolated phenomenon but was deeply embedded in the cultural, religious, and intellectual fabric of the time. By integrating Fanger’s, Klaassen’s, and Peterson’s work, we gain a richer understanding of how magic functioned and was perceived in medieval society.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The study of medieval magic, enriched by the contributions of Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson, offers valuable insights into the period’s cultural and religious dynamics. Fanger’s exploration of spiritual agency, Klaassen’s examination of the relationship between magic and religious authority, and Peterson’s work on grimoires and magical texts collectively enhance our understanding of medieval magical practices. Their scholarly efforts continue to illuminate the complex and integral role of magic in medieval life, offering a deeper appreciation of its significance and impact.

In this original, provocative, well-reasoned, and thoroughly documented book, Frank Klaassen proposes that two principal genres of illicit learned magic occur in late medieval manuscripts: image magic, which could be interpreted and justified in scholastic terms, and ritual magic (in its extreme form, overt necromancy), which could not. Image magic tended to be recopied faithfully; ritual magic tended to be adapted and reworked. These two forms of magic did not usually become intermingled in the manuscripts, but were presented separately. While image magic was often copied in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, The Transformations of Magic demonstrates that interest in it as an independent genre declined precipitously around 1500. Instead, what persisted was the other, more problematic form of magic: ritual magic. Klaassen shows that texts of medieval ritual magic were cherished in the sixteenth century, and writers of new magical treatises, such as Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee, were far more deeply indebted to medieval tradition—and specifically to the medieval tradition of ritual magic—than previous scholars have thought them to be.</div>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic offers a fascinating window into the cultural, religious, and intellectual dynamics of the period. Scholars such as Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson have made significant contributions to this field, each providing unique insights into different aspects of medieval magic. This essay examines their contributions, with a focus on Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement, Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres, and Peterson’s work on grimoires and magical texts.

<strong>Claire Fanger: Divine Manifestation and Spiritual Engagement</strong>

Claire Fanger’s work has profoundly impacted the study of medieval magic, particularly through her book *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012). In this volume, Fanger explores how magical texts and practices sought to bridge the gap between the divine and the mundane. The final paragraph of the *Liber iuratus Honorii* encapsulates this aim, presenting the text as a means to see God face to face and secure eternal salvation (Fanger, 2012). This claim reflects the deep intertwining of magical practices with broader religious and spiritual questions.

Fanger’s analysis highlights two central questions addressed by these texts: how the divine can manifest in the world and how humans, despite being unfit for direct divine knowledge, can still engage with divine things for salvation (Fanger, 2012). Her work reveals that magical texts were not mere esoterica but were deeply embedded in the religious and intellectual concerns of the time. By examining these texts, Fanger demonstrates the rich tapestry of medieval spiritual life and the ways in which magic was used to explore and access the divine.

Moreover, Fanger acknowledges the increasing scholarly interest in magical texts, which had been relatively unexplored until recent decades. Her work underscores the challenges and excitement of engaging with new discoveries in this evolving field, shedding light on the complex interplay between magical practices and broader cultural and intellectual currents (Fanger, 2012).

<strong>Frank Klaassen: Genres of Magic and Their Evolution</strong>

Frank Klaassen’s *&quot;The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and the Renaissance&quot;* (2013) provides a critical perspective on the evolution of magical genres in late medieval manuscripts. Klaassen identifies two principal genres of illicit learned magic: image magic and ritual magic. Image magic, which could be interpreted and justified in scholastic terms, was often faithfully recopied, while ritual magic, particularly in its extreme form of overt necromancy, was adapted and reworked (Klaassen, 2013).

Klaassen’s analysis reveals that image magic, which had a more intellectual and scholastic justification, declined in prominence around 1500. This decline contrasts sharply with the persistence of ritual magic, which continued to be a significant area of interest and practice in the sixteenth century. Klaassen argues that the later tradition of ritual magic, as seen in the works of figures like Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee, was more deeply indebted to medieval ritual magic than previously recognized (Klaassen, 2013).

Klaassen’s work demonstrates that the two forms of magic were not typically intermixed in manuscripts but were presented separately. This distinction highlights the different ways in which medieval and Renaissance scholars engaged with and adapted magical traditions. By documenting the decline of image magic and the persistence of ritual magic, Klaassen provides valuable insights into the evolving nature of magical practices and their impact on subsequent magical traditions.

<strong>Joseph Peterson: Grimoires and Magical Texts</strong>

Joseph Peterson’s contributions to the study of medieval grimoires and magical texts are foundational. His translations and analyses of key magical manuscripts, such as the *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;* (2004) and the *&quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;* (2001), offer critical insights into the practical aspects of medieval magic. Peterson’s work makes these texts accessible to scholars and provides detailed information about their contents and historical context.

Peterson’s translation of the *&quot;Ars Notoria&quot;* reveals the complex rituals and prayers used to invoke divine knowledge and achieve spiritual enlightenment. This text, part of the tradition of intellectual magic, demonstrates the intricate connections between ritual practice and intellectual pursuits in the medieval period (Peterson, 2004). Similarly, Peterson’s work on the *&quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;* sheds light on the broader tradition of magical practice and its evolution over time (Peterson, 2001). His meticulous translations and contextual analyses help scholars understand the historical development of magical practices and their significance within medieval and early modern contexts.

<strong>Integrating the Contributions</strong>

The combined contributions of Fanger, Klaassen, and Peterson offer a comprehensive view of medieval magic. Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement reveals the deep connections between magical practices and broader religious concerns. Klaassen’s examination of the evolution of magical genres provides insights into how different forms of magic were perceived and adapted over time. Peterson’s work on grimoires and magical texts offers direct insights into the practices and beliefs of medieval practitioners.

These scholars’ contributions highlight the multifaceted nature of medieval magic. Magic was not an isolated phenomenon but was deeply embedded in the cultural, religious, and intellectual fabric of the time. By integrating Fanger’s, Klaassen’s, and Peterson’s work, we gain a richer understanding of how magic functioned and was perceived in medieval society.

The study of medieval magic, enriched by the contributions of Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson, provides valuable insights into the period’s cultural and religious dynamics. Fanger’s exploration of spiritual agency, Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres, and Peterson’s work on grimoires collectively enhance our understanding of medieval magical practices.

He was even thought to be the model for Shakespeare&#x27;s Prospero. 

All this was preparation for Dee&#x27;s main achievement: five books, revealed and transcribed between March 1582 and May 1583, bringing to light mysteries and truths that scholars and adepts have been struggling to understand and use ever since. These books detail his system for communicating with the angels, and reveal that the angels were interested in and involved with the exploration and colonization of the New World, and in heralding in a new age or new world order. While Dee&#x27;s influence was certainly felt in his lifetime, his popularity has grown tremendously since. His system was used and adapted by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and subsequently by Aleister Crowley.
This new edition of John Dee&#x27;s Five Books of Mystery is by far the most accessible and complete published to date. Peterson has translated Latin terms and added copious footnotes, putting the instructions and references into context for the modern reader.</div>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic provides crucial insights into the cultural, religious, and intellectual dynamics of the period. Scholars such as Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson have made substantial contributions to this field, each offering unique perspectives on different aspects of medieval magic. This essay examines their contributions, focusing on Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement, Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres, and Peterson’s work on grimoires, magical texts, and John Dee’s occult research.

<strong>Claire Fanger: Divine Manifestation and Spiritual Engagement</strong>

Claire Fanger’s work has had a profound impact on the study of medieval magic, particularly through her book *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012). Fanger’s exploration of the *Liber iuratus Honorii* highlights the text&#x27;s ambition to facilitate direct divine contact and secure eternal salvation (Fanger, 2012). The final paragraph of the *Liber iuratus Honorii* positions the text as a means to see God face to face and engage with the divine, illustrating the intricate connections between magical practices and broader religious and spiritual questions.

Fanger addresses two central concerns in her work: how the divine might manifest in the world and how humans, despite their limitations, can engage with divine forces for salvation (Fanger, 2012). Her analysis reveals that magical texts were integral to the religious and intellectual landscape of the time. By examining these texts, Fanger sheds light on the ways in which medieval people sought alternative methods to access the divine, reflecting a broader interest in and anxiety about traditional liturgies and sacraments.

Fanger also notes the growing scholarly interest in magical texts, which had previously been overlooked. Her work underscores the excitement and challenges of engaging with new discoveries in this field, offering a nuanced understanding of the interplay between magic, religion, and intellectual pursuits (Fanger, 2012).

<strong>Frank Klaassen: Genres of Magic and Their Evolution</strong>

Frank Klaassen’s *&quot;The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and the Renaissance&quot;* (2013) provides a critical perspective on the evolution of magical genres. Klaassen identifies two principal genres of illicit learned magic: image magic and ritual magic. Image magic, which could be justified within scholastic frameworks, was often faithfully recopied, while ritual magic, particularly overt necromancy, was adapted and reworked (Klaassen, 2013).

Klaassen’s analysis reveals that image magic, with its intellectual justification, declined around 1500, while ritual magic continued to be a significant area of interest. His work demonstrates that the later tradition of ritual magic, as seen in figures like Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee, was more deeply rooted in medieval ritual magic than previously recognized (Klaassen, 2013). Klaassen’s research highlights the separate presentation of these genres in manuscripts and their distinct trajectories in magical traditions.

By documenting the decline of image magic and the persistence of ritual magic, Klaassen provides valuable insights into how medieval and Renaissance scholars engaged with and adapted magical traditions. His work underscores the evolving nature of magical practices and their impact on subsequent magical thought.

<strong>Joseph Peterson: Grimoires, Magical Texts, and John Dee</strong>

Joseph Peterson has made significant contributions to the study of medieval grimoires and magical texts, particularly through his translations and analyses of key manuscripts. His work on John Dee is particularly noteworthy. In *&quot;John Dee’s Five Books of Mystery&quot;* (2003), Peterson presents Dee’s occult research in a comprehensive and accessible format. The book, discovered in a hidden compartment of an old chest long after Dee’s death, records Dee’s detailed research into the occult and his system for communicating with angels (Peterson, 2003).

Peterson’s edition of Dee’s works is notable for its accessibility and completeness. He translates Latin terms and adds copious footnotes, contextualizing Dee’s instructions for modern readers (Peterson, 2003). This edition not only illuminates Dee’s complex system of angelic communication but also highlights his diverse achievements as a Renaissance man involved in astronomy, mathematics, navigation, and the occult sciences. Peterson’s brief biography of Dee emphasizes his role as a model for Shakespeare’s Prospero and his influence on later occult traditions, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley (Peterson, 2003).

Peterson’s work underscores Dee’s significant impact on both his contemporaries and later occult traditions. His translations and contextual analyses make Dee’s writings more accessible and provide a deeper understanding of Dee’s influence on magical practices and theories.

<strong>Integrating the Contributions</strong>

The combined contributions of Fanger, Klaassen, and Peterson offer a comprehensive view of medieval magic. Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement reveals the intricate connections between magical practices and religious concerns. Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres provides insights into how different forms of magic were perceived and adapted over time. Peterson’s work on grimoires and John Dee’s occult research offers direct insights into the practices and beliefs of medieval and Renaissance practitioners.

These scholars’ contributions highlight the multifaceted nature of medieval magic. Magic was not an isolated phenomenon but was deeply embedded in the cultural, religious, and intellectual fabric of the time. By integrating Fanger’s, Klaassen’s, and Peterson’s work, we gain a richer understanding of how magic functioned and was perceived in medieval society.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The study of medieval magic, enriched by the contributions of Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, and Joseph Peterson, provides valuable insights into the period’s cultural and religious dynamics. Fanger’s exploration of spiritual agency, Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres, and Peterson’s work on grimoires and John Dee collectively enhance our understanding of medieval magical practices. Their scholarly efforts continue to illuminate the complex and integral role of magic in medieval life, offering a deeper appreciation of its significance and impact.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic reveals much about the cultural, religious, and intellectual climate of the time. Scholars such as Claire Fanger, Frank Klaassen, Joseph Peterson, and Sophie Page have made significant contributions to our understanding of medieval magic. Each scholar offers a unique perspective on different aspects of this multifaceted subject. This essay examines their contributions, focusing on Fanger’s exploration of divine manifestation and spiritual engagement, Klaassen’s investigation into the evolution of magical genres, Peterson’s work on grimoires and John Dee, and Page’s research on monastic magic and the broader historical context.

<strong>Claire Fanger: Divine Manifestation and Spiritual Engagement</strong>

Claire Fanger’s *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012) provides a critical examination of how medieval texts addressed the manifestation of the divine and the means by which humans could engage with divine forces. Her study of the *Liber iuratus Honorii* reveals the text’s ambition to facilitate direct divine contact and secure eternal salvation (Fanger, 2012). The text’s final paragraph asserts its unique value in accessing divine presence, positioning it as a crucial tool for achieving spiritual goals.

Fanger explores two fundamental questions central to her analysis: how the divine might manifest in the world and how humans, despite their limitations, can engage with divine forces for salvation (Fanger, 2012). Her work highlights the growing scholarly interest in magical texts and their role in medieval religious practice. Fanger’s examination of these texts uncovers a rich interplay between magic and traditional religious practices, illustrating how medieval people sought alternative means of divine engagement amidst a backdrop of growing anxiety about conventional liturgies and sacraments.

<strong>Frank Klaassen: Genres of Magic and Their Evolution</strong>

Frank Klaassen’s *&quot;The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and the Renaissance&quot;* (2013) offers a critical analysis of the evolution of magical genres during the late medieval and early modern periods. Klaassen identifies two principal genres of illicit learned magic: image magic and ritual magic. Image magic, which could be justified within scholastic frameworks, was often faithfully recopied, while ritual magic, particularly overt necromancy, was adapted and reworked (Klaassen, 2013).

Klaassen’s research demonstrates that while image magic declined around 1500, ritual magic persisted as a significant area of interest. His work reveals that later scholars, such as Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee, were more deeply indebted to medieval ritual magic than previously recognized (Klaassen, 2013). By documenting the decline of image magic and the enduring influence of ritual magic, Klaassen provides valuable insights into the shifting landscape of magical practices and their impact on subsequent magical thought.

<strong>Joseph Peterson: Grimoires, Magical Texts, and John Dee</strong>

Joseph Peterson has made substantial contributions to the study of medieval grimoires and magical texts, particularly through his translations and analyses of key manuscripts. His work on John Dee is particularly noteworthy. In *&quot;John Dee’s Five Books of Mystery&quot;* (2003), Peterson presents Dee’s occult research in an accessible and comprehensive format. The book, discovered in a hidden compartment of an old chest long after Dee’s death, details Dee’s system for communicating with angels and explores his diverse achievements as a Renaissance man (Peterson, 2003).

Peterson’s edition of Dee’s works is notable for its detailed translations and footnotes, which contextualize Dee’s instructions for modern readers (Peterson, 2003). This edition not only illuminates Dee’s complex system of angelic communication but also highlights his influence on later occult traditions, including the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley. Peterson’s work underscores Dee’s significant impact on both his contemporaries and subsequent magical practices.

<strong>Sophie Page: Monastic Magic and Historical Context</strong>

Sophie Page’s *&quot;Magic in the Cloister: Learned Magic at the French Monastery of Saint-Maur&quot;* (2013) provides an in-depth examination of the role of magic within a specific monastic community. Page’s study investigates the collection of learned magic texts once held by the Benedictine monastery at St. Augustine&#x27;s in Canterbury, exploring the rationality that justified the learning and practice of magic within this context (Page, 2013).

Page’s work draws on recent editorial and theoretical advancements to elucidate how magic was integrated into medieval Christian belief and practice. Her study reveals that magic was not only present but also rationalized within the monastic environment, contributing to a broader understanding of the intersection between magic and orthodox religion. Page’s research emphasizes the significance of these texts in understanding the diversity of magical practices and their influence on medieval spiritual life (Page, 2013).

Additionally, Page’s contributions to *&quot;The Routledge History of Medieval Magic&quot;* (2023) offer extensive insights into recent developments in the study of medieval magic. This volume, featuring contributions from scholars across Europe and North America, covers a wide range of topics, including magical texts, intellectual and ecclesiastical attitudes toward magic, and the intersections of magic with other aspects of medieval culture, such as gender roles and natural philosophy (Page, 2023). The book’s interdisciplinary approach, encompassing archaeology, literature, music, and visual culture, provides a comprehensive overview of magic’s impact on medieval society and outlines future research directions in the field.

<div class="msg user"><div class="role user">You</div>I&#x27;d like you to add a discussion of Fanger&#x27;s take on the description of medieval magic as theurgy, using the example of the ars notoria. Here is more material from her book to integrate. Some part of the popularity of the Ars notoria was thus probably due to its 
self-representation as sacred; no doubt its proliferation was helped along, too, 
by the pragmatic nature of its advertised goals (which might potentially ease 
the expense of university study, reducing time spent on education and the over- 
all cost of books and exemplars). By the late fourteenth century the text existed 
in several versions, and copies from this period can be found deriving from 
many European locations. The earliest, or “A? version (as Véronése labels it in 
his edition), is an unglossed ritual containing prayers, notae, and some mytho- 
historical context, but almost no ritual instruction; a slightly later version (the 
“B” version)® includes the original prayers and notae and adds an extensive gloss 
containing ritual instructions and further mythohistorical context. The gloss 
offers clues to the use and reception of the basic liturgy, answering some impor- 
tant questions about how the ritual was supposed to be performed and how it 


INTRODUCTION 5 


was understood and thought about. Prior to the work of Véronése, the relation 
between the various versions of the notory art was unknown, and the glossed 
version was essentially unread. In his chapter in this volume, Véronése gives a 
descriptive and interpretive account of the glossed version, describing the oper- 
ating instructions as represented in the glosses in Paris, Bibliotheque nationale 
de France, lat. 9336, then zooming out to treat more broadly some of the opera- 
tive resemblances between the Ars notoria, Neoplatonic theurgy, and Christian 
sacraments. 

As was the common fate of many medieval liturgies, the notory art was fre- 
quently taken apart and its components repurposed; its prayers, verbal formulae, 
and structuring ideas were reused in other works, some more nearly and some 
more distantly related to it. The work that is most explicitly connected to it is the 
Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching by John of Morigny. 


John of Morigny 


John was a monk of the Benedictine order at Morigny, educated at Chartres and 
Orleans and active in the first quarter of the fourteenth century. What is known 
about him comes almost entirely from his own Liber florum celestis doctrine 
(Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching), which, in addition to containing a 
lengthy prayer text (modeled on the Ars notoria, and similarly designed to peti- 
tion angels for the transmission of curricular knowledge), includes many auto- 
biographical passages.!° John’s writings are a key source of information about 
the Ars notoria, since he describes his own and others’ experience of its oper- 
ation before learning (via a vision induced by the Ars notoria itself) that the 
prayers in outlandish tongues had in fact been corrupted by subtle insertion of 
demonic invocations.&quot; 

By his own account, John discovered the Ars notoria when he was a student 
too poor to afford books. He had acquired a work of necromancy from a col- 
league and copied as much of it as he could, but he was beset by doubts about 
pursuing its rituals. After consulting a Lombard doctor named Jacob, he was 
directed to the Ars notoria, from which, according to the doctor, he might ob- 
tain all the knowledge he sought without danger to his soul.!* Guided by the 
doctor, John first approached the Ars notoria as a sacred text and a wholesome 
alternative to the demonic conjurations he had been contemplating. 

As he used the art, he learned better. The Ars notoria opened vistas on a dark 
visionary landscape filled with nightmarish forms and demons masquerading 
as monks or persons of the Trinity. John was eventually helped to free himself 
by Christ, John the Evangelist, and especially the Virgin Mary. When he finally 


6 INVOKING ANGELS 


laid aside the Ars notoria, still wishing to obtain what he calls “the good part 
of his purpose,” he sought from the Virgin permission to compose his own art, 
similarly intended to infuse the operator with knowledge of the liberal arts, phi- 
losophy, and theology with only thirty simple prayers. The Virgin agreed, and 
the Book of Thirty Prayers (the primary liturgy of the Liber florum) was delivered, 
its express purpose to supplant and destroy the corrupt Ars notoria. It offered 
worthy seekers an alternative mode of obtaining knowledge through instruction 
from the Virgin.” 

This text is a recent discovery. Unlike the Ars notoria (which, though chroni- 
cally understudied in the past, has always been known to exist in printed books 
as well as manuscripts), the text of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching was not 
actually known to survive at all much before the 1990s. In the Grandes Chro- 
niques de France there is recorded for the year 1323 a somewhat sensational ac- 
count of the burning of a work by a monk who attempted, claiming instruction 
from the Virgin Mary, to bring back the condemned Ars notoria in another 
guise;&#x27;* but it is not until 1987 that the first notice of a connection between the 
monk described here and an actual text in a manuscript in the Bayerische Staats- 
bibliothek is suggested in a footnote to an article on the Ars notoria by Jean 
Dupébe.” In the 1990s, independent discoveries of several more manuscripts 
(by Sylvie Barnay in France, and myself and Nicholas Watson in Ontario)!* show 
that the Liber florum did not in fact come to the abrupt end that one might have 
been tempted to assume from the Chroniques account. Indeed, the work contin- 
ued to be copied and used through the fifteenth century, largely in a monastic 
context, the latest known manuscript dating from the early sixteenth century.” 

We are now aware that there are two surviving authorial versions of this text.&#x27; 
The earlier version (or “Old Compilation”), which John completed between 1310 
and 1313, culminates in a Book of Figures that may have incorporated as many as 
ninety-two figures to go with the prayers, probably intended to be used in simi- 
lar fashion to the notae of the Ars notoria. Unfortunately, most of these are not 
included in the only known Old Compilation manuscript.” In the later version 
(or “New Compilation”), dated 1315, John completely rewrote the text of the 
Book of Figures and cut the number down to eight: seven iconic images of the 
Virgin and one image of an apocalyptic Christ. 

In my own contribution to this volume, I look at the way John casts the rela- 
tion between the Old and New Compilation texts as parallel to the relation be- 
tween the Old and New Testaments; his own Old Compilation is, like the Old 
Testament, superseded by the new work, which is its fulfillment; but the Old 
Compilation nevertheless remains sacred in its own right. I go on to compare 
the Liber florum with another work that, in one version at least, makes similar 
claims related to the idea of sacramental supersession: the Liber iuratus Honorii. 


INTRODUCTION 7 


The Liber iuratus Honorii or Sworn Book of Honorius 


As it turns out, the Sworn Book of Honorius, previously known only through the 
version found in a handful of manuscripts in the British Library, is extant in 
another version as well, as reported by Jan Veenstra in chapter 4 of this volume. 
This newly discovered version is witnessed in a manuscript of the Summa sacre 
magice, a massive compilation of magic texts circulating in Spain that was com- 
piled in the first half of the fourteenth century by a redactor named Berengario 
Ganell. Like most of the works in this volume, the Summa sacre magice has 
only recently been found worthy of examination.” Veenstra’s analysis of the 
Ganell version demonstrates conclusively that it belongs to a different tradition 
of redaction—a tradition clearly prior to that in the English manuscripts that 
were, until now, the only known witnesses of the text. The date of origin of the 
Sworn Book has not been pinpointed with certainty (in fact, Veenstra’s discover- 
aes have overturned some of what was thought to be known about it), but cir- 
amnstantial evidence still points to the early fourteenth century, certainly for 
the London version and perhaps for the earlier one as well.”! 

Like the Ars notoria, the Sworn Book is fundamentally concerned with seek- 
ing heavenly knowledge from angels, though what is sought in this case is not 
knowledge couched in the hierarchical structure of the seven liberal arts but 
rather a transformative vision: it claims that its ritual will induce a vision of 
God, face to face, as Adam and the Prophets saw him. It opens with a reference 
to the “greate name of God which the Hebrues call sememphoras which dothe 
consyst of 72 . . . letters”? John of Morigny, too, refers to the “Semhemphoras,” 
giossing it as a Hebrew word meaning “most elect name of God” and noting 
i as another term for the tetragrammaton.”’ This much was common currency 
for educated Christians from the works of Jerome and Isidore. The reference to 
the name of seventy-two letters, however, was not a patristic commonplace, and 
it seems to derive from some more direct contact with Jewish tradition.% The 
seventy-two-letter name referred to here, together with a number of other as- 
pects of the text, show that the master of the Sworn Book was drawing con- 
sciously, though not always in a fully informed way, on ritual information from 
non-Christian Abrahamic traditions. </div>
<div class="msg assistant"><div class="role assistant">ChatGPT</div>### Medieval Magic and Theurgy: The Case of the *Ars Notoria* and its Context

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic encompasses a variety of practices and beliefs, including the concept of theurgy. Claire Fanger’s examination of the *Ars Notoria* provides insight into how certain magical texts were perceived as sacred and their role in the broader context of medieval theurgy. This essay integrates Fanger’s analysis with a focus on the *Ars Notoria*, its popularity, and its connections to Neoplatonic theurgy and Christian sacraments, as well as its influence on other texts such as John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching*.

<strong>Claire Fanger and Theurgy in the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

Claire Fanger’s *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012) offers a detailed analysis of the *Ars Notoria*, highlighting its self-representation as a sacred text and its association with theurgical practices. The *Ars Notoria* was popular in the late fourteenth century, partly due to its portrayal as a divine tool that could ease the cost of education and improve access to knowledge (Fanger, 2012).

The text’s various versions—such as the unglossed “A” version and the more developed “B” version—reveal its evolution from a ritual containing basic prayers to a more complex work with detailed ritual instructions and mythohistorical context (Fanger, 2012). The “B” version, with its extensive glosses, provides clues about the text&#x27;s practical use and its reception, highlighting how it was intended to be performed and understood.

Fanger points out that the *Ars Notoria* was frequently repurposed, with its prayers and rituals adapted into other works. This process of adaptation and reuse underscores the text’s influence on medieval magical practices. The *Ars Notoria*’s association with Neoplatonic theurgy is particularly noteworthy. The theurgical aspects of the text, aimed at direct divine contact and knowledge acquisition, are evident in its structure and intent.

<strong>The *Ars Notoria* and Neoplatonic Theurgy</strong>

The *Ars Notoria*’s emphasis on divine communication and knowledge acquisition reflects Neoplatonic theurgical principles. The text&#x27;s goal of achieving divine insight through ritual practices aligns with Neoplatonic beliefs about theurgy as a means of invoking higher spiritual realities and achieving union with the divine. Fanger’s analysis shows that the *Ars Notoria* was not merely a practical guide but also a tool for spiritual enlightenment, akin to other theurgical practices of the time (Fanger, 2012).

The text’s popularity and proliferation can be attributed to its perceived sacred nature and its promise of practical benefits. By presenting itself as a divine method for obtaining knowledge, the *Ars Notoria* appealed to those seeking to enhance their intellectual and spiritual standing without the expense and time commitment of traditional education. The text’s adaptation and reuse in other magical and religious contexts further demonstrate its influence and integration into medieval spiritual practices.

<strong>John of Morigny and the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching* (Liber florum celestis doctrinae) provides a direct example of how the *Ars Notoria* was interpreted and repurposed. Morigny’s work, which includes prayers modeled on the *Ars Notoria*, was initially intended to offer an alternative to what he perceived as the corrupt elements of the *Ars Notoria* (Fanger, 2012). Morigny’s account of his experiences with the *Ars Notoria* illustrates the text’s impact on its users and its perceived dangers.

Morigny’s personal narrative highlights the challenges and revelations he encountered while using the *Ars Notoria*. Despite its promise of divine knowledge, Morigny discovered disturbing elements within the text, leading him to create his own work to supplant it. His *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching* aimed to provide a purer, more direct means of obtaining knowledge through prayers addressed to the Virgin Mary, reflecting his desire to correct the perceived flaws in the *Ars Notoria* (Fanger, 2012).

<strong>The Influence of the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

The *Ars Notoria*’s influence extended beyond Morigny’s work, impacting various aspects of medieval magical and religious practices. Its integration into other texts and its adaptation by different authors demonstrate its role in shaping medieval views on magic and theurgy. Fanger’s research reveals that the *Ars Notoria* was part of a broader tradition of magical and theurgical texts that sought to bridge the gap between divine and human knowledge.

The text’s association with theurgy and its widespread use underscore its significance in the study of medieval magic. By examining the *Ars Notoria* through the lens of Neoplatonic theurgy and its influence on subsequent works, Fanger’s analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of medieval magical practices and their spiritual implications (Fanger, 2012).

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Claire Fanger’s exploration of the *Ars Notoria* provides valuable insights into the text’s role in medieval magical and theurgical practices. The text’s popularity, its connections to Neoplatonic theurgy, and its influence on works like John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching* highlight its significance in the broader context of medieval spirituality and knowledge acquisition. Fanger’s analysis demonstrates how the *Ars Notoria* was more than a practical guide; it was a sacred text that reflected the complex interplay between magic, religion, and intellectual pursuits in the medieval period.

### Claire Fanger’s Examination of the *Ars Notoria* and its Theurgical Context

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The study of medieval magic encompasses a variety of practices and beliefs, including the concept of theurgy. Claire Fanger’s examination of the *Ars Notoria* offers crucial insights into how certain magical texts were perceived as sacred and their role in the broader context of medieval theurgy. This section integrates Fanger’s analysis with a focus on the *Ars Notoria*, its popularity, its connections to Neoplatonic theurgy, and its influence on other texts such as John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching*.

<strong>Claire Fanger’s Analysis of the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

Claire Fanger’s *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;* (2012) provides a comprehensive examination of the *Ars Notoria*, a text that gained popularity in the late fourteenth century. Fanger highlights the text’s dual appeal: its portrayal as a sacred tool and its promise of practical benefits, such as enhancing intellectual capabilities and reducing the costs of education. The *Ars Notoria* existed in various versions, with the “A” version being an unglossed ritual and the “B” version including extensive glosses with detailed ritual instructions (Fanger, 2012). This evolution reflects the text’s adaptation and increasing complexity over time.

Fanger’s study emphasizes the *Ars Notoria*&#x27;s significant role in medieval magical practices. The text’s reputation as a divine method for obtaining knowledge allowed it to be widely circulated and adapted, demonstrating its influence on medieval spiritual and intellectual life. 

<strong>The *Ars Notoria* and Neoplatonic Theurgy</strong>

A key aspect of the *Ars Notoria* is its connection to Neoplatonic theurgy. The text&#x27;s emphasis on divine communication and knowledge acquisition aligns with Neoplatonic principles, where theurgy was used as a means to invoke higher spiritual realities and achieve union with the divine. Fanger’s analysis reveals that the *Ars Notoria* was not just a practical guide but also a tool for spiritual enlightenment, akin to other theurgical practices of the time (Fanger, 2012).

The text’s portrayal as sacred and its integration into various magical and religious contexts underscore its role in bridging the gap between divine and human knowledge. The *Ars Notoria*’s adaptation into other works further illustrates its influence and the extent to which its theurgical aspects were embraced by its users.

<strong>John of Morigny and the Influence of the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching* (Liber florum celestis doctrinae) provides a direct example of the *Ars Notoria*&#x27;s impact and its subsequent reinterpretation. Morigny’s work, which includes prayers modeled after the *Ars Notoria*, was intended as a purer alternative to the perceived flaws in the *Ars Notoria*. His narrative of using the *Ars Notoria* and discovering disturbing elements within it highlights the text’s influence and the complex relationship between magical and religious practices (Fanger, 2012).

Morigny’s creation of his own work, aimed at providing a more direct means of obtaining knowledge through prayers to the Virgin Mary, reflects his attempt to correct what he saw as the corrupt elements in the *Ars Notoria*. This illustrates the text’s significant role in shaping medieval magical and religious thought.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Claire Fanger’s exploration of the *Ars Notoria* provides valuable insights into its role in medieval magical practices and its connections to Neoplatonic theurgy. The text’s popularity, its portrayal as a sacred tool, and its influence on subsequent works like John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching* highlight its significance in the broader context of medieval spirituality and knowledge acquisition. By examining the *Ars Notoria* through both its practical applications and its theurgical implications, Fanger’s analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of medieval magic and its complex interplay with religious and intellectual pursuits.

The study of medieval magic involves a complex interplay of texts, rituals, and theological interpretations. This essay examines the contributions of four prominent scholars—Claire Fanger, Joseph Peterson, Sophie Page, and the discussion of theurgy as seen through the *Ars Notoria*—to provide a nuanced understanding of medieval magical practices and their cultural contexts. Each scholar offers unique insights into how magic was perceived, practiced, and understood in the medieval period.

<strong>Claire Fanger’s Examination of the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

Claire Fanger’s work, particularly her examination of the *Ars Notoria* in *&quot;Invoking Angels: Magics, Rituals, and the Occult in the Later Middle Ages&quot;*, is instrumental in understanding the text’s role in medieval magical traditions. The *Ars Notoria*, with its emphasis on acquiring knowledge through divine communication, reflects a blend of practical and sacred goals. Fanger highlights how the text’s portrayal as a divine tool for intellectual enhancement contributed to its widespread use and adaptation. The various versions of the *Ars Notoria*, from the unglossed “A” version to the glossed “B” version, demonstrate its evolving complexity and its integration into medieval magical practices.

<strong>The *Ars Notoria* and Theurgy</strong>

Fanger’s analysis also explores the *Ars Notoria*’s connection to Neoplatonic theurgy. The text’s ritual instructions and divine communications align with theurgical practices aimed at achieving spiritual enlightenment and divine union. The portrayal of the *Ars Notoria* as a sacred text, combined with its practical applications, illustrates its role in bridging spiritual and intellectual pursuits. This connection to theurgy is significant in understanding how medieval magical practices intersected with broader spiritual and theological frameworks.

Sophie Page’s contributions, as seen in *&quot;Magic in the Cloister: Learned Magic at the French Monastery of Saint-Maur&quot;* and *&quot;The Routledge History of Medieval Magic&quot;*, offer valuable insights into the role of magic in medieval monastic life and broader European contexts. Page’s study of the texts held by the Benedictine monastery at St. Augustine’s in Canterbury reveals how magic was integrated into medieval Christian belief and practice. Her analysis of the *Ars Notoria* and its adaptation into other works, like John of Morigny’s *Book of the Flowers of Heavenly Teaching*, underscores the text’s influence on monastic and intellectual circles.

<strong>Fanger’s Take on Theurgy and the *Ars Notoria</strong>*

Fanger’s work on the *Ars Notoria* highlights its theurgical aspects, showing how the text’s ritual instructions and divine communications were perceived as sacred practices. The *Ars Notoria*’s connection to Neoplatonic theurgy and its impact on other magical texts illustrate the complex relationship between magic, spirituality, and intellectual pursuits in the medieval period. Fanger’s analysis demonstrates how the *Ars Notoria* was used both as a practical tool and a means of achieving spiritual enlightenment, reflecting its dual role in medieval magical traditions.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The contributions of Claire Fanger, Joseph Peterson, and Sophie Page offer a comprehensive view of medieval magic and its contexts. Fanger’s examination of the *Ars Notoria* provides insights into its role as both a practical and sacred text, while Peterson’s work on John Dee reveals the significance of Dee’s occult research in the development of Western esotericism. Page’s studies of medieval magical texts and their integration into monastic life highlight the broader impact of magic on medieval society. Together, these scholars enhance our understanding of medieval magic and its complex interactions with spirituality, intellectualism, and religious practice.

<strong>Exploring the Contributions of Four Key Scholars in Medieval Magic Studies</strong>

<strong>Frank Klaassen&#x27;s Contributions:</strong>

Frank Klaassen&#x27;s seminal work, *The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and the Renaissance*, provides a profound analysis of two principal genres of illicit learned magic: image magic and ritual magic. Klaassen argues that image magic, which could be justified within scholastic terms, was faithfully recopied in late medieval manuscripts. In contrast, ritual magic, particularly in its extreme form of overt necromancy, was frequently adapted and reworked. This distinction reveals the complexity of magical practices and their reception over time.

Klaassen&#x27;s examination of the Ars Notoria, a notable example of image magic, underscores its initial popularity due to its perceived sacred nature and practical benefits for students. By the late fourteenth century, various versions of the text emerged, ranging from unglossed ritual instructions to more elaborate versions with extensive glosses. Klaassen highlights that while image magic enjoyed a degree of acceptance, interest in it waned by around 1500, giving way to the more contentious form of ritual magic. This shift underscores the enduring impact of ritual magic on later figures such as Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee.

<strong>Joseph Peterson&#x27;s Contributions:</strong>

Joseph H. Peterson’s *John Dee&#x27;s Five Books of Mystery* offers a critical edition and translation of John Dee’s secret writings, providing invaluable insights into Dee&#x27;s occult research. Dee, a prominent figure in Elizabethan England, is portrayed by Peterson as a &quot;true Renaissance man,&quot; whose work spanned astronomy, mathematics, navigation, and the occult. Peterson&#x27;s edition, the most accessible and complete to date, includes translations and footnotes that contextualize Dee&#x27;s intricate instructions for modern readers.

Peterson&#x27;s work reveals Dee’s system for communicating with angels and his involvement with the exploration and colonization of the New World. The popularity of Dee’s system, which influenced the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley, is further elucidated by Peterson’s detailed account. This contribution is crucial for understanding Dee’s role in shaping occult traditions and his broader impact on Western esotericism.

<strong>Sophie Page&#x27;s Contributions:</strong>

Sophie Page’s research, particularly in *Magic in the Cloister: Learned Magic at the French Monastery of Saint-Maur*, investigates the role of magic within medieval Christian contexts. Page’s study of the Benedictine monastery at St. Augustine’s in Canterbury provides insights into the rationality that justified the practice of learned magic. Her work reveals how magic was integrated into monastic life and how it was perceived as both similar to and distinct from orthodox religion.

In *The Routledge History of Medieval Magic*, Page, along with other scholars, offers a comprehensive overview of medieval magic from c.1100 to c.1500. The book covers a wide range of topics, including magical texts, intellectual attitudes towards magic, and the intersection of magic with medieval culture. It also outlines future research directions, making it a valuable resource for both scholars and students interested in medieval magic.

<strong>Claire Fanger&#x27;s Contributions:</strong>

Claire Fanger’s examination of the Ars Notoria in *Invoking Angels: Theurgy in the Later Middle Ages* explores its self-representation as a sacred text and its proliferation due to its practical benefits for students. Fanger highlights the text’s various versions, from unglossed rituals to more elaborate versions with extensive glosses. Her analysis of the Ars Notoria’s use and adaptation, particularly its influence on figures like John of Morigny, sheds light on its complex relationship with Neoplatonic theurgy and Christian sacramental practices.

Fanger’s work also addresses the broader implications of the Ars Notoria’s integration into medieval magical traditions and its eventual replacement by more refined texts. This discussion provides a nuanced understanding of theurgy’s role in medieval magic and its impact on later magical practices.

Frank Klaassen and Sharon Hubbs Wright
“This short scholarly study has two key virtues: it teases apart two muddled-up historiographies and unites two unnecessarily distanced ones. First, it clears a distinct space in the historical record for practitioners of magic, who as religious and legal deviants too often get absorbed into the academic discussion of witches and witch-trials. Secondly, it exploits the fact that 16th-century magical texts tell us little about the people who used them, while legal records of prosecution — magic was first criminalised under the 1542 Witchcraft Act — tell us a lot about the magicians but frustratingly little about the technicalities of their offences.”</div>

<strong>Frank Klaassen&#x27;s Contributions:</strong>

Frank Klaassen is a leading scholar in the study of medieval and early modern magic. His groundbreaking work, *The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and the Renaissance* (Penn State University Press, 2012), received the Margaret Labarge Prize and examines the evolution of illicit magic through two primary genres: image magic and ritual magic. Klaassen’s detailed analysis reveals how image magic, despite its scholarly justifications, was extensively recopied until around 1500, after which ritual magic began to dominate, influencing later magical practices and figures like Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee.

Klaassen’s subsequent publications continue to shed light on various aspects of magic. *Making Magic in Elizabethan England* (Penn State University Press, 2019) and *The Magic of Rogues: Necromancers and Authority in Early Tudor England* (Penn State University Press, 2021), co-authored with Sharon Wright, are key contributions to the field. The forthcoming *Everyday Magicians in Tudor England* (also co-authored with Wright) promises to further illuminate the role of magic in everyday Tudor life.

*The Magic of Rogues: Necromancers and Authority in Early Tudor England* provides a nuanced exploration of magical practitioners who operated outside the bounds of formal religious and legal structures. This study accomplishes two main goals: 

1. <strong>Separating Historical Narratives:</strong> Klaassen and Wright distinguish the study of necromancers from the broader academic discussions on witches and witch trials, offering a clearer historical account of these practitioners. They emphasize that necromancers, often considered religious and legal deviants, deserve separate consideration from witches.

2. <strong>Examining Legal and Technical Aspects:</strong> The book addresses the gap in historical records by focusing on how 16th-century magical texts provide limited information about the practitioners themselves, while legal records, particularly those related to the 1542 Witchcraft Act, offer significant insights into the individuals accused of magic but lack details on the technical aspects of their practices.

Klaassen’s scholarship is instrumental in understanding the transformations and receptions of magical practices over time. His work on the Ars Notoria in *The Transformations of Magic* illuminates its role and decline, while *The Magic of Rogues* highlights the complexities of legal and social perceptions of magic practitioners in early Tudor England. Together, these contributions offer a comprehensive view of the evolution of magic and its practitioners in medieval and early modern contexts.

<strong>Frank Klaassen&#x27;s Contributions to the Study of Magic</strong>

Frank Klaassen has significantly advanced the study of magic, particularly through his analysis of illicit magical practices in the late medieval and early modern periods. His work offers crucial insights into how magic was perceived, practiced, and regulated during these transformative times.

<strong>The Transformations of Magic:</strong>

In his seminal book, *The Transformations of Magic: Illicit Learned Magic in the Later Middle Ages and Renaissance* (2012), Klaassen examines the evolution of two primary genres of learned magic: image magic and ritual magic. Image magic, which involved the creation and use of magical images to influence the world, was initially popular due to its scholarly justification and its alignment with scholastic traditions. Klaassen reveals how this genre was extensively replicated and adapted over time. However, by the early 16th century, interest shifted towards ritual magic, which became the dominant form of magical practice. Klaassen’s detailed analysis of these transitions helps to understand the broader shifts in magical practices and their impact on later figures such as Agrippa von Nettesheim and John Dee.

<strong>The Magic of Rogues:</strong>

In *The Magic of Rogues: Necromancers and Authority in Early Tudor England* (2021), co-authored with Sharon Hubbs Wright, Klaassen provides a focused study of necromancers during the early Tudor period. This book makes a significant contribution by disentangling the history of necromancers from the broader discourse on witches and witch trials. It highlights how necromancers, often marginalized and criminalized under laws such as the 1542 Witchcraft Act, were distinct from witches and should be studied separately.

The book addresses a critical gap in historical records: while 16th-century magical texts offer limited information about the practitioners, legal records from the period provide valuable insights into their lives and the legal frameworks that affected them. Klaassen and Wright’s study sheds light on the ways in which necromancers were treated under the law and the challenges they faced in maintaining their practices amidst increasing legal and social pressures.

<strong>Influence and Interdisciplinary Engagement:</strong>

Klaassen&#x27;s work is notable for its interdisciplinary approach, combining manuscript studies with legal history and social analysis. His scholarship not only deepens our understanding of specific magical practices but also enhances our knowledge of the broader socio-legal context in which these practices were situated. Klaassen&#x27;s emphasis on manuscript evidence and his exploration of how magical practices were repurposed and adapted over time offer a nuanced perspective on the evolution of magic and its practitioners.

Through his detailed investigations into both the textual and legal aspects of magic, Frank Klaassen has made invaluable contributions to the field. His work helps to illuminate the complexities of magical practices and their interactions with legal and social institutions, providing a richer understanding of the role of magic in historical contexts.
