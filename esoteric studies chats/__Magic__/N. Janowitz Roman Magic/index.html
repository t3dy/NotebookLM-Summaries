| <strong>Introduction</strong>          | Defines &quot;magic&quot; as a polemical tool in religious and political conflicts. Highlights its usage in exposing social and power dynamics in the Roman world. Acknowledges the term&#x27;s lack of self-definition and rehabilitates &quot;magicians&quot; by linking practices to acceptable rituals.                                                                                                                                | Offers a new lens to view ancient &quot;magic&quot; as a social construct rather than deviant behavior. Challenges stereotypes of magical practices as distinct from legitimate religion.                                                                         | Avoids modern scholarly terms, making it less accessible to experts. Misses the opportunity to deeply situate within broader academic debates.                                              | &quot;Accusations of &#x27;magic&#x27; reveal social tensions, internecine battles, competition for power, and fear of others&#x27; special abilities.&quot;                                                | &quot;The practices called magic were little different from acceptable religious or ritual practice.&quot; (p.1)                                    | Tacitus (*Histories*), Graf&#x27;s research, Theophrastus (*Characters 16*), Grodzynski on *superstitio*.                                                                                 |
| <strong>Chapter 1: Concepts of Magic</strong> | Explores *mageia* and *magos* across Roman, Christian, and Rabbinic sources. Reveals &quot;magic&quot; as a flexible and ambiguous category, even in legal terms. Discusses Jewish and Christian struggles to separate themselves from practices labeled as magical.                                                                                                                        | Connects accusations of magic with the term *superstitio* and links it to broader sociocultural dynamics.                                                                                                                                           | Lacks clarity on the historical relevance of sources spanning centuries. Fails to link magic to *superstitio* when addressing Greco-Roman views of Jewish practices.                             | Magic accusations reflect attempts to demarcate acceptable vs. suspect rituals in evolving religious landscapes.                                                                  | &quot;Christian and Jewish sources struggled to defend their rites against suspect practices that seemed barely different from their own.&quot; (p.26)                             | Tacitus (*Histories*), Theophrastus, Plato, Hippocrates, Grodzynski (*superstitio*), Rabbinic literature.                                                                               |
| <strong>Chapter 2: Daimons &amp; Exorcism</strong> | Surveys daimonology and exorcism in the 1st–3rd centuries AD. Suggests exorcism rituals were integral to this era and tied to bodily conflicts between human and supernatural forces. Argues exorcism became &quot;magic&quot; only in modern interpretations.                                                                                                                                       | Introduces a nuanced view of daimonology&#x27;s evolution and exorcism&#x27;s role in religious and social systems.                                                                                                                                           | Sources inconsistently cited, mixing Hesiod, Josephus, Tertullian, and Homer without clear connections. Neglects angelology&#x27;s development.                                                | Exorcism was not inherently magical but became labeled as such due to modern assumptions.                                                                                        | &quot;Exorcism is an integral feature of late antique society where the human body becomes a battleground for conflicts between human and supernatural forces.&quot; (p.46)              | Hesiod, Josephus, Tertullian, Plutarch, Valerie Flint (*Witchcraft and Magic in Europe*), Homer.                                                                                      |
| <strong>Chapter 3: Love Rituals</strong>      | Discusses ancient texts on love magic, like Hebrew *Book of Secrets* and Greek sources. Links suspect goals (e.g., material gain, cursing) to common rituals. Explores voodoo dolls and amulets as mediators between divine and human realms, akin to cult icons.                                                                                                                             | Frames love rituals as cultural acts reflecting cause-and-effect beliefs, blending religious and magical traditions.                                                                                                                                | Limited discussion of texts like *Book of Secrets* and minimal engagement with broader sources.                                                                                           | Love magic exemplifies how ritualized activities blur the boundaries of magic and religion.                                                                                      | &quot;Love rituals are viewed as a special type of cultural activity fitting contemporary notions of cause and effect.&quot; (p.55)                                          | *Book of Secrets*, Greek Magical Papyri, Faraone (*Ancient Greek Love Magic*).                                                                                                       |
| <strong>Chapter 4: Alchemy</strong>           | Profiles Maria the Jewess and her contributions to early alchemy. Redefines alchemy as an early scientific pursuit to harness cosmic energy, arguing against its categorization as magic.                                                                                                                                            | Highlights the integration of alchemy into early scientific and philosophical systems rather than mystical practices.                                                                                                                                | Insufficient examples beyond Maria to support the argument.                                                                                                                          | Early alchemy reflects humanity&#x27;s attempts to manipulate natural forces, often misunderstood as magic.                                                                             | &quot;Early alchemy represents the beginnings of scientific enquiry, attempting to harness cosmic energies for human ends.&quot; (p.59)                                        | Maria the Jewess, Swoboda (*Nigidii Figuli*), Ankerloo &amp; Clark (*Witchcraft and Magic in Europe*).                                                                                    |
| <strong>Chapter 5: Divinization</strong>      | Examines Jewish, Greco-Roman, and Christian concepts of divinization. Discusses rituals for accessing higher realms and argues that magical and religious acts share ritualistic similarities.                                                                                                                                    | Draws parallels between magical and religious practices, suggesting a shared emphasis on ritual.                                                                                                                                                     | Unclear focus, oscillating between figures of magicians and techniques of divinization.                                                                                              | Divinization techniques demonstrate the ritual continuity between religion and magic in accessing divine realms.                                                                | &quot;Rituals to gain access to the higher realm do not differentiate the magical act from the religious.&quot; (p.85)                                                       | Greek Magical Papyri, Rabbinic texts, Christian scriptures.                                                                                                                         |
| <strong>Chapter 6: Gender &amp; Magic</strong>    | Highlights the association of women with magic in antiquity due to societal and biological anxieties.
